A summary of the unverified reports was prepared as background material for the briefing, but not discussed during the meeting, the official said. During Trump's press conference Wednesday morning, the president-elect said he was made aware of the information \"outside that meeting.\" A 35-page memorandum published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday includes claims that the Russian government has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for five years \u2014 even obtaining compromising information in an effort to blackmail him. (BuzzFeed is partially funded by the parent company of NBC News.) The document, which was not prepared by the U.S. government, contains obvious errors. It was originally generated as part of opposition research by anti-Trump Republicans and then shopped by Democrats. Related: Seth Meyers Confronts Conway Over Trump Allegations Two U.S. officials told NBC News that materials prepared for Trump in advance of last week's intelligence briefing included damaging allegations from the memorandum \u2014 unverified by American intelligence agencies \u2014 about his dealings with the Russians. Officials prepared a two-page summary of the memo for Trump's briefing Friday at Trump Tower in New York. The summary was an \"annex,\" or addendum, included in the \"supporting documents\" that accompanied the classified briefing report. While multiple officials say the summary was included in the material prepared for the briefers, the senior official told NBC News that the briefing was oral and no actual documents were left with the Trump team in New York. During the briefing, the president-elect was not briefed on the contents of the summary . \"Intel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period,\" the senior official said. According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted \"disinformation.\" The briefers also had available to them unvetted \"disinformation\" about the Clinton Foundation, although that was not orally shared with Trump.

Listen as Emma Stone shows off her singing talent in this romantic musical with an old-Hollywood feel. USA TODAY NETWORK Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in 'La La Land.' (Photo: Dale Robinette) Is there any stopping\u00a0La La Land? The movie musical about\u00a0two young artists dreaming and falling in love in Los Angeles danced away with a record-breaking seven Golden Globes \u00a0Sunday night. On Monday, it received 11 BAFTA nominations plus a coveted nomination for the Producers Guild Awards'\u00a0top prize , a historic indicator that a film will nab a best picture Oscar nomination. And that was just this week. The\u00a0film \u2014 starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and directed by Whiplash's Damien Chazelle\u00a0\u2014 has also picked up AFI's movie of the year award, best actor and actress nominations from the Screen Actors Guild,\u00a0and seven Critics' Choice Awards including best picture.\u00a0USA TODAY\u2019s Brian Truitt gave the movie\u00a0four out of four stars in his review,\u00a0 calling it \u00a0\u201ca clear favorite in the Oscar best-picture race,\u201d and \u201cboth delightful confection and life-affirming food for the soul.\u201d\u00a0The film boasts\u00a0a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes . However,\u00a0La La Land\u00a0is a film that does not, in many aspects,\u00a0live up to its accolades, especially compared with other awards fare like\u00a0Moonlight. Its\u00a0chief selling point \u2014 to the audience and awards voters alike \u2014 is its nostalgic revival of the \"Old Hollywood\" movie musical, yet its music is one of its weakest aspects. While some numbers, like opener\u00a0Another Day of Sun,\u00a0are ambitious in scope and musicality, others, like the recently awarded\u00a0City of Stars (which surprisingly beat out a Lin-Manuel Miranda-penned song for the Globe), are lackluster and dull. Gosling and Stone, while great actors,\u00a0are also simply not truly trained singers, and their thin vocals are evident\u00a0throughout the film. While the choice is intentional\u00a0and might endear some to the performances, it's\u00a0distracting and takes you out of the fantasy the film is attempting to create. When Stone truly lets loose on\u00a0Audition Song\u00a0near the end, it becomes apparent that the rest of the musical was written just slightly out of her most comfortable range. x Share Musical 'La La Land' leads the race for the British Academy Film Awards with 11 nominations, followed by 'Arrival' and 'Nocturnal Animals' with nine. (Jan. 10) AP Also thinly drawn is Stone's character, Mia, a hollow person that the movie shortchanges in favor of focusing more on Gosling's Sebastian. Mia's backstory is brushed over, and her talent and struggle are never portrayed as fully as Sebastian's. A one-woman show she writes and self-finances is the crux of her journey in the film, yet the audience sees almost nothing of the show itself, let alone the\u00a0effort she put into producing it. Her big break at the end of the movie (an audition for a \"big movie\" as nonspecific as her character) feels unearned. Sebastian, meanwhile, is shown paying his dues on multiple occasions \u2014 from playing Christmas carols at a restaurant to playing in a cheesy '80s cover band to touring with a jazz-pop crossover band he hates. Straight Up Hollywood: Lowdown on 'La La Land' Sebastian's storyline is not without its flaws. His character has been called a \"white savior\" by critics\u00a0including Wired , New York Magazine \u00a0and MTV News \u00a0for his quest (and eventual success) to save the traditionally black musical genre from extinction, seemingly the only person who can accomplish such a goal. As MTV News \u00a0notes, in the film\u00a0\"no one is as gifted at tickling the ivories as Gosling and his pearly white hands,\" adding,\u00a0\"If you\u2019re gonna make a film about an artist staying true to the roots of jazz against the odds and against modern reinventions of the genre (from white musicians like, say, Mayer Hawthorne), you'd think that artist would be black.\" Even La La Land's own awards narrative feels undeserved. The sentiment that La La Land should be honored\u00a0for simply being an original musical that Hollywood took a \u201crisk\u201d in creating, repeated ad nauseum at the Globes acceptance podium,\u00a0is not quite accurate. Musicals have had a resurgence in Hollywood in recent years, from the live shows like Hairspray\u00a0on NBC and Grease\u00a0on Fox to a weekly original musical in CW's Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Musical Sing Street\u00a0competed for the best musical or comedy Globe alongside La La Land, and animated musicals Moana\u00a0and Sing\u00a0cleaned up at the box office.\u00a0Additionally, Chazelle wasn't\u00a0a risky filmmaker in which to invest, as he was just coming off an Oscar nomination for Whiplash. Gosling and Stone only add to the film's credentials as\u00a0two of Hollywood\u2019s most bankable actors with a history of starring in projects together. Golden Globes 2017: The winners list Despite its flaws and a backlash simmering online, there\u2019s no denying that the movie is on a roll, or that the film is a stunning visual and technical achievement. Hollywood loves stories about itself. Look at former best picture winners Argo and The Artist\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it\u2019s not shocking that these people love a film that romanticizes and glorifies their own lives and struggles. Nostalgia, too, has a firm grip on the Academy: In 2010, traditional historical drama The King\u2019s Speech won over the more ambitious and modern\u00a0The Social Network. In a year where actors make pointed political statements at the awards podium, the allure of easy escapism like La La Land may be stronger than more challenging films like Moonlight, which tells the story of a black gay man as he grows from lost child to bullied teen to intimidating drug dealer. There\u2019s more than\u00a0a month until the Academy Awards, with a handful of smaller award ceremonies yet to go. La La Land is the presumed front-runner for the best picture Oscar, and unless its backlash gets louder, it looks like things are going to stay that way. But we should see the movie for what it is \u2014\u00a0a nostalgic, easily forgettable romance\u00a0\u2014 rather than building it up just because its characters sing and dance. 9589 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 27 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ikOUG9 NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

    "text": "Medical Experts Concerned After Trump Meets With Vaccine Skeptic By Gillian Mohney Jan 11, 2017, 4:43 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH CDC Director: Vaccine Compliance 'Different World' from 25 Years Ago 0 Shares Email Doctors and members of the medical community are raising concerns after President-elect Donald Trump met with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has advocated for parental opt-out provisions for routine childhood vaccinations . \"President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies, and he has questions about it,\" Kennedy told reporters immediately after the meeting on Tuesday. \"His opinion doesn't matter, but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science, and we ought to be debating the science. Everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have \u2014 he's very pro-vaccine, as am I \u2014 but they're as safe as they possibly can be.\" Kennedy also told reporters that Trump asked him to chair a commission on vaccine safety, but the Trump team did not confirm that appointment and said the president-elect was exploring a commission that would look broadly at autism . \"The president-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas,\" the Trump transition team said in a statement. \"The president-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however, no decisions have been made at this time. The president-elect looks forward to continuing the discussion about all aspects of autism with many groups and individuals.\" The meeting, coupled with Trump's past statements on vaccines, has raised alarm in the medical community, which stands by a preponderance of evidence that shows no link between autism and vaccines. Kennedy has made controversial statements about vaccines for many years, generally unsupported by the larger medical community. He wrote a 2014 book that supported a theory born in the 1990s that claimed thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine additive, is a dangerous neurotoxin that could trigger autism and should be banned. Kennedy has linked vaccines and autism on his website. The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reviewed hundreds of studies since then and have consistently found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. The additive is no longer used in routine childhood vaccines and is considered safe in the doses used in influenza vaccines, according to the CDC. In 2015, Kennedy visited several states to argue against rules that make it more difficult for students to be exempt from vaccine requirements, although he said he is \"pro-vaccine,\" according to his website. In response to Trump's meeting with Kennedy, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement emphasizing the safety of vaccines and their importance in safeguarding children's health against common, easily spread and sometimes deadly childhood illnesses. \"Claims that vaccines are linked to autism or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature,\" said Dr. Fernando Stein and Dr. Karen Remley, the president and vice president, respectively, of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement today. \"Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease. Vaccines keep communities healthy and protect some of the most vulnerable in our society, including the elderly and children who are too young to be vaccinated or have compromised immune systems.\" \"We stand ready to work with the White House and the federal government to share the extensive scientific evidence demonstrating the safety of vaccines, including the recommended schedule,\" Stein and Remley wrote. Experts Call Republican Candidates' Vaccine Claims 'False' and 'Dangerous' Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he was hopeful about a commission on autism and hoped it would leave out any mention of vaccines. \"A commission on autism might well be a very good thing to direct attention\" to the condition, he said. But \"as regards to vaccines, we would keep reinforcing the notion that vaccines are one of the greatest public health triumphs, they are safe and effective and not associated with autism.\" Other medical groups have also responded to the meeting, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which released a statement in support of vaccines this morning saying the group \"stands behind the overwhelming scientific evidence that has repeatedly demonstrated the overall safety and benefit of routine childhood vaccinations.\" \"Children are far more likely to be harmed by vaccine preventable illness, such as measles , than by the vaccines that prevent such infections,\" IDSA officials said in the statement. Trump previously expressed skepticism about vaccines. During a 2015 Republican candidates' debate Trump reiterated statements he had made associating autism with vaccines. \"We had so many instances, people that work for me,\" Trump said. \"Just the other day, 2 years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\" \"Autism has become an epidemic \u2014 25 years ago, 30 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close,\" he said. \"It has gotten totally out of control.\" Alison Singer, the president and a co-founder of the Autism Science Foundation, released a statement after that debate saying science overwhelmingly supported vaccinations as safe. In a statement yesterday she said she is concerned that underimmunizing children will put them at risk for contracting preventable diseases, adding that opting out of vaccinations will not lower the risk for developing autism. \"Science has answered\" the question, Singer said. \"All of the studies that we have done have shown there is no link between vaccines and autism.\" 0 Shares ",

That's technically true, since Congress did exempt the president and vice president from conflict of interest laws. Sajwani's company, DAMAC, confirmed to NBC News that there were discussions in recent days about \"a variety of different property deals,\" but the proposals were rejected. Sajwani is already a Trump business partner; they collaborated on the Trump International Golf Club, where luxury villas have racked up almost $2 billion in sales, according to Sajwani. At Trump's New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, he gave Sajwani and his family, who were in the audience, a shout-out \u2014 calling them \"beautiful people.\" Related: Dubai Billionaire Ready to Do More Deals With Trumps After Trump's election, the desert-kingdom developer gave NBC News a tour of the resort and talked about his interest in doing more deals, even as ethics experts were raising concerns about the financial ties Trump family already has to overseas businesses that sometimes have strong links to foreign political leaders. \"I would love to enhance the relation with the Trump Organization,\" said Sajwani. Donald and Ivanka Trump with Dubai developer Hussein Sajwani. Masala.com Sajwani, who is close to the emir of Dubai, spoke in particular about his dealings with Trump's children. \"All his three children are very much involved, and I think under their leadership we will have no issue in expanding and growing and maintaining our business relation,\" Sajwani said in the interview. \"My wife and Ivanka are very good friends,\" he added. \"They send emails. She's been here to my house. We've been in New York having lunch and dinners with them regularly. And, you know, you enjoy working with somebody \u2014 it's not only cold business relation.\" Ethics experts have expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest in sensitive areas like the Middle East. Sajwani brushes off those concerns. He says there's no reason to be worried about the nexus of his close relationship with the emir of Dubai and his financial links to the next occupant of the Oval Office. \"I am not involved in any political issues or positions,\" Sajwani said. \"My relation with my highness is purely as a citizen of this country.\" But Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project for Government Oversight, a nonprofit accountability organization, said that, such assurances aside, Trump's international money-makers and his family's continued involvement in the company mean the new president \"is going to have divided loyalties.\" \"He's now going to be pursuing U.S. foreign policy, with an eye to the fact that it may be impacting his family's financial interests,\" Brian said. \"And this is not only a case of what we perceive. It's going to be what the rest of the world is perceiving.\" Trump announced at Wednesday's press conference that his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., will run his business while he is in office. His daughter, Ivanka, whose husband has been named a senior advisor to the president, will remove herself from management of the business, it was announced. Trump also pledged that his company will no longer make any foreign deals. \"We're in many, many countries, and I'm very proud of it,\" he said. Tracy Connor ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Former CIA director James Woolsey. (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) . WASHINGTON \u2014 Targets of foreign intelligence, including presidents, need to know the unsubstantiated and potentially compromising personal information that could be used against them, intelligence and law enforcement experts say.. While the public disclosure of the document summarized in the briefing materials has widened a troubling rift between President-elect Donald Trump and the U.S. intelligence community, the former officials said top spy agency directors were likely acting responsibly, even if their only aim was to warn Trump of the information\u2019s existence and the imminent risk that it would be made public. Trump was told about the information during a meeting with top intelligence officials last Friday.\u00a0\u201cIt's all fake news. It\u2019s phony stuff. It didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said at his press conference Tuesday. \u201cI read what was released, and I think it\u2019s a disgrace. It's an absolute disgrace.\" A U.S. official familiar with the matter has said that the information, the product of a political opposition research report compiled by a former British intelligence officer, was included in the briefing materials, at least in part, because it had been widely circulated among U.S. lawmakers, journalists and others.The identity of the former British intelligence officer, Chris Steele, was first disclosed Wednesday by\u00a0The\u00a0Wall Street Journal. Steele is now a director of London-based Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd.\u00a0\u00a0 The information compiled by Steele was allegedly gathered from Russian operatives.\u00a0The opposition research operation began as the \u00a0result of a Republican interest, according to the U.S. official. It later became part of a Democratic interest, the official said. Campaign finance disclosures with the Federal Election Commission do not show any disbursements directly to Steele's company from U.S. candidates or campaigns in the 2016 election cycle. Ex-CIA director James Woolsey, a former adviser to Trump, declined to comment Wednesday on whether the president-elect's team was aware of the information before it was carried into last week's intelligence briefing. But Woolsey said top government leaders should get the information to \"get an accurate perception of what is out there in order to do their jobs.'' \"It shouldn't be a risk to provide this kind of information to a cleared person,'' Woolsey said, referring to top officials with appropriate security clearances. \"The problem is that it was made public.'' Trump blamed the public disclosure of the information on U.S. intelligence agencies, comparing it to the tactics of \"Nazi Germany.'' Read more: Intel chiefs briefed Trump, Obama on unverified, salacious allegations concerning Russia and president-elect Late Wednesday, BuzzFeed published the raw, unsupported 35-page dossier on its website after CNN first disclosed that a summary of the material \u2014 purporting to link\u00a0Trump to\u00a0long-standing back-channel communications with the Kremlin and other personal conduct \u2014 had been included in the briefing materials brought to Trump last week. Though she said it might be necessary to alert someone who was a \u201cvictim of any kind of influence campaign.\u201d A measure of how broadly the material had been circulating emerged Wednesday when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., acknowledged turning over the \"sensitive information'' to the FBI last month. \u201cLate last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public,'' McCain said in a statement. \"Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.\u201d Read more: Wide-ranging news conference finds Trump confident, combative and optimistic Reporters from various news outlets also had sought confirmation of the information with Rick Wilson, a GOP strategist, but he hadn\u2019t seen a copy of the document before Tuesday and denied passing any copies to U.S. intelligence. \u201cMany, many, many (people saw the report) in recent months because it\u2019s a small enough circle of people and reporters and others are running into each other and crossing trails as they went through this thing,\u201d Wilson\u00a0said Wednesday. The U.S. official with knowledge of the matter confirmed Wednesday that McCain gave material to the FBI. The same documents, however, had been in the possession of the bureau months before McCain's contact, said the official who is not authorized to comment publicly. President-elect Donald Trump looks out at the press during a news conference at Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 11, 2017. \u00a0(Photo: Justin Lane, European Pressphoto Agency) Authorities have been examining the information since it was first obtained, but the official said that the salacious contents of it have remained unsubstantiated. As authorities became aware of the raw document's widening circulation and the imminent possibility that could be made public, top officials decided to include the summary as an appendix to the packet compiled to brief the president-elect on Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. election. \"These presidential briefings are always evolving and changing based on who occupies the office,'' said former FBI assistant director Ron Hosko. \"But I think there is a naivete on the part of the public and press about the kind of influence campaigns that countries like Russia and China are pursuing. These are nation states who are all about getting an advantage in our world. Even if this information is unsubstantiated, it ought to be included (in a briefing) as something that could be used against a president.'' Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday declined to comment on the information that was briefed to the president-elect. Contributing: Brad Heath and Nick Penzenstadler Posted!

    "text": "Trump to Nominate David Shulkin for Secretary of Veterans Affairs By RYAN STRUYK Jan 11, 2017, 11:58 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump to Nominate David Shulkin for Secretary of Veterans Affairs 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump says he intends to nominate David Shulkin to be secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Shulkin has been the department's undersecretary for health since 2015, after being nominated by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate. Trump made the announcement at a news conference this morning, marking the first time someone with no military experience could lead the vast organization. The Department of Veterans Affairs has been plagued by controversy over the past several years. One of the largest bureaucracies in the federal government, the department's health system employs more than 300,000 people who serve nearly 9 million veterans per year, according to the agency's website. \u201cIt is my honor to serve as President-elect Trump\u2019s Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\u201d Shulkin said in a statement today. \"We are both eager to begin reforming the areas in our Veterans Affairs system that need critical attention, and do it in a swift, thoughtful and responsible way.\u201d The position was one of Trump's final Cabinet-level roles yet to be announced. Shulkin told USA Today in December that he has spearheaded a new system to rate veterans' hospitals, adding that 120 of the 146 facilities reviewed have improved in the past 18 months. The article released an internal document identifying the best and worst of the facilities. Shulkin previously led the University of Pennsylvania's health system and the Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. He also served as President at Morristown Medical Center, Goryeb Children\u2019s Hospital, Atlantic Rehabilitation Institute and the Atlantic Health System Accountable Care Organization, according to his Veterans' Affairs department biography. 0 Shares ",

Manning's lawyers painted their client as a naive whistle-blower who caused little more than mortification. Manning pleaded guilty and before the sentencing delivered an apology to the court \u2014 and the nation. A recording of that statement is being broadcast for the first time by NBC News. \"I'm sorry,\" Manning said. \"I'm sorry that my actions hurt people. I'm sorry that they hurt the United States.\" \"I understand that I must pay the price for my decisions and actions,\" Manning added. Those words of contrition did not sway the military judge, who gave Manning a sentence about 10 times longer than those of recent whistle-blowers. \"After this case, I had to tell Chelsea: 'I've represented murderers. I've represented rapists. I've represented child molesters. And none of them received 35 years,'\" defense lawyer David Coombs told NBC News. Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning, leaves a military court facility in 2013. SAUL LOEB / AFP - Getty Images Manning \u2014 who announced she was a transgender woman named Chelsea the day after the verdict \u2014 didn't seem to process what the sentence meant for her, her aunt said. \"I don't think it really sunk in,\" Deborah Manning said. \"Thirty-five years is just a long thing to try to imagine, especially when you're just in your early 20s.\" Manning's supporters believe the harshness of the sentence can be traced to another leaker; the scandal around former NSA contractor Edward Snowden was erupting around the same time. \"I really believe the judge felt she needed to send some sort of message,\" the aunt said. \"I think in a way she was a scapegoat for Edward Snowden.\" Snowden, who has asked Obama for clemency, tweeted his support of Manning shortly after NBC News' report about the commutation decision aired on TODAY on Wednesday morning. Mr. President, if you grant only one act of clemency as you exit the White House, please: free Chelsea Manning. You alone can save her life. \u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) January 11, 2017 Four former and current Army intelligence officers told NBC News the documents leaked by Manning pale in significance to highly classified top secret material released by Snowden. The officers, who would not allow their names to be used, said the Manning sentence seems excessive. The Manning leak included video of a deadly 2007 air strike in Baghdad in which the U.S. helicopter crew could be heard laughing about the casualties and State Department cables with blunt comments from American diplomats. \"I don't think any harm was done,\" Coombs said of the disclosures. \"A lot of embarrassment, certainly.\" Alexa O'Brien, a freelance journalist, covered the trial and sat in the courtroom every day. She said she believes Manning did not mean to harm the U.S. and that the pre-sentence apology was genuine. \"Everything she said in that statement is completely morally and ethically consistent with what she said when she pled to 10 lesser or included offenses,\" O'Brien said. People hold signs calling for the release of imprisoned wikileaks whistleblower Chelsea Manning while marching in a gay pride parade in San Francisco, California June 28, 2015. Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters Last month, more than 100,000 people signed an online petition seeking commutation of Manning's sentence, meeting the threshold for a White House response within 60 days. The American Civil Liberties Union and gay-rights groups have also been lobbying for a reprieve. In their petition to President Obama, Manning's legal team cited the need for better medical care for gender dysphoria, a condition that includes severe distress or anxiety by some transgender people. Manning has been receiving hormone therapy at the Leavenworth military prison and is allowed to wear women's undergarments, but a military doctor recently refused to change her gender on her Army records. Manning's aunt said she hoped Obama would consider the former soldier's troubled upbringing, struggles with gender identity and remorse. \"I would say this is someone who's never had a chance in life, who is extremely bright, who became extremely emotionally distressed as some point, who made a bad decision, who paid for that bad decision,\" Deborah Manning said. \"And it's time to let her go out and try to make a positive contribution in the world.\" Cynthia McFadden ",

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) In his first press conference since July, President-elect Donald Trump repeated some false and misleading claims on jobs, health care and his tax returns: \u2022\u00a0Trump falsely claimed that there are \u201c96 million really wanting a job and they can\u2019t get [one].\u201d There are roughly 96 million people not in the labor force, but that includes retirees, students and others who don\u2019t want jobs. Only 5.5 million of them want work. \u2022\u00a0Trump said that \u201cyou learn very little\u201d from a tax return. But experts told us there\u2019s plenty of information to be gleaned from tax returns \u2014 such as potential conflicts of interest, charitable giving habits and effective tax rates. \u2022\u00a0Trump claimed that \u201csome states\u201d have seen health insurance coverage on the Affordable Care Act exchanges increase by 100%. Only Arizona has an average increase that high, and 84% with marketplace coverage in 2016 received tax credits to purchase insurance. \u2022\u00a0Trump continues to oversimplify the rise of the Islamic State by blaming President Obama for \u201cleaving at the wrong time\u201d from Iraq. President George W. Bush set the withdrawal date. More important, there were numerous factors in the rise of the terrorist group. \u2022 Trump claimed that \u201cnobody even talked about it\u201d when hacked emails showed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign got debate questions in advance. Actually, there was plenty of press coverage when it was revealed that former CNN contributor Donna Brazile shared questions with Clinton\u2019s campaign. Trump hasn\u2019t held a press conference since July 27, 2016 , during the Democratic National Convention. The purpose was to discuss how he would arrange to handle his business affairs while he is president. Trump will take the oath of office on Jan. 20 . But the Republican president-elect was asked a variety of questions on a host of issues, including Russian hacking, the Affordable Care Act and his Cabinet appointments. In several cases, Trump repeated some of the same claims that he had made during the campaign. Trump on Jobs Trump wrongly claimed, once again , that there are \u201c96 million really wanting a job and they can\u2019t get [one].\u201d There are roughly 96 million people \u201cnot in the labor force,\u201d but only 5.5 million of them \u201ccurrently want a job,\u201d according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Trump cited the statistic in the context of a border tax on \u201cthese companies that are leaving [the U.S.] and getting away with murder.\u201d Trump, Jan. 11: \"And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you\u2019d have millions more workers right now in the United States that are \u2014 96 million really wanting a job and they can\u2019t get. You know that story. The real number \u2014 that\u2019s the real number.\" According to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , there were 95.8 million people \u201cnot in the labor force\u201d in December. But Trump is wrong to lump them all in as \u201creally wanting a job.\u201d According to BLS, only 5.5 million of them \u201ccurrently want a job.\u201d Those not looking for a job include millions of retirees, teenagers and stay-at-home parents. For example, there were 18.3 million people age 75 and older who were not in the workforce in December, BLS says . Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump argued that the \u201creal\u201d unemployment rate was higher than the official one, because he said it did not include those so frustrated by the labor market that they simply gave up looking for work. Indeed, the labor force participation rate has been on the decline, and the Congressional Budget Office attributed some of that recent decline to workers so discouraged by the slow recovery from the recession that they stopped looking for work. But CBO estimated about half of the decline was due to long-term structural trends, mainly aging baby boomers reaching retirement age. The Tax Returns, Again Trump said that \u201cyou learn very little\u201d from a tax return and that \u201cthe only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters.\u201d But experts told us there\u2019s plenty of information to be gleaned from tax returns \u2014 such as potential conflicts of interest, charitable giving habits and effective tax rates. And polls show that a majority of Americans say Trump should release his tax returns. Trump was asked whether he would release his tax returns to prove that he has no business dealings in Russia. He responded: \u201cI\u2019m not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they\u2019re under audit.\u201d That was Trump\u2019s stance during the campaign as well. Also during the campaign, when he was facing questions about releasing his returns \u2014 something many 2016 presidential candidates and every major party nominee since the late 1970s had done \u2014 Trump claimed that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to learn\u201d from his tax returns. He repeated a version of that claim in his press conference, claiming, \u201cyou learn very little [from] a tax return.\u201d When we wrote about this in May, experts cited several details voters could learn from a candidate\u2019s tax returns, including sources of income, deductions taken, potential conflicts, overseas income and how a candidate\u2019s tax proposals could affect his or her personal tax situation. Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax Analysts\u2019 Tax History Project , wrote in a May 12 blog pos t on taxnotes.com that \u201c[r]eturns can shed light on the way a candidate lives his life. It can tell us about charitable giving as well as personal borrowing and investment activity. Returns can also illuminate the complicated business arrangements that often provide the bulk of a candidate\u2019s income, especially for a real estate mogul like Trump.\u201d And the returns \u201ctell us a lot about how candidates conduct themselves in the gray areas of the tax law,\u201d Thorndike wrote. Trump also claimed in his press conference that reporters were the only ones that cared about his tax returns. A reporter followed up: \u201cYou don\u2019t think the American public is concerned about it?\u201d Trump replied: \u201cNo I don\u2019t think so. I won, when I became president. No, I don\u2019t think they care at all. I don\u2019t think they care at all.\u201d Polls show that, in fact, the American public does care. A Pew Research Center poll, conducted Jan. 4-9, found 60% of respondents said Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns. Those who identified as Democrats or leaning Democratic more strongly supported this view: Seventy-nine percent said Trump had a responsibility to release the returns, while 38% of Republicans or those learning Republican had that view. Other polls have shown similar results. A CBS News poll conducted Dec. 9-13, 2016, asked whether it was \u201cnecessary\u201d for Trump to release his tax returns. Sixty percent responded that it was necessary. A Quinnipiac University poll taken Aug. 18-24, 2016, asked likely voters: \u201cDo you think Donald Trump should publicly release his tax returns, or not?\u201d Seventy-four percent said he should release them, including a majority (62%) of Republicans. Premium Cherry-Picking Trump claimed that under the Affordable Care Act, \u201csome states have over a hundred percent increase\u201d in premiums. Actually, only one state has an average increase in exchange premiums that high: Arizona. Premiums on the ACA exchanges \u2014 for individuals who buy their own insurance \u2014 have jumped up an average 25% from 2016 to 2017 among the 38 HealthCare.gov states, and that\u2019s substantially higher than the 7.2% average increase from 2015 to 2016. The variation in the change in premiums among states, and even within states from county to county, is also substantial, with Arizona, at the high end, seeing a 116% average increase, while Indiana, at the other extreme, has an average 3 percent decrease. The median increase is 16%. These figures, which do not include subsidies available to lower-income individuals, are for the average second lowest-cost silver \u201cbenchmark\u201d plans for a 27-year-old, and they\u2019re part of a report released by the Department of Health and Human Services in October. As the chart displayed here shows, some states had average premium changes in the single digits, others in double digits, and Arizona had the distinction of a triple-digit average increase. As we wrote before, the wide disparity on the numbers makes the report ripe for cherry-picking. At least one county had a nearly 100% increase (see Table 13 of the report). In Medina County, Texas, the average increase is 99%, from an average $201 monthly premium to $399. Texas overall, however, had an 18% average increase. Massachusetts, which has a state-based exchange (not the federally run HealthCare.gov), saw an average 3% decrease, while Minnesota\u2019s state-based exchange had an average 59% increase \u2014 again, showing the contrast across the country. Adding in four state-based marketplaces plus the District of Columbia\u2019s \u2014 for which HHS had data \u2014 brings the nationwide average increase down to 22%. The vast majority of Americans who buy coverage through the exchanges get tax credits, which shelter them from these premium increases. The credits cap the amount a person must contribute toward a benchmark plan based on income. The HHS report says 84% of the 10.4 million Americans with marketplace coverage in the first half of 2016 received tax credits, and that 77% of current enrollees can find plans for $100 or less, after factoring in tax credits. An estimated 7 million Americans buy their own insurance but do so outside of the exchanges. Trump on Obama Creating ISIS Trump continues to oversimplify the situation by placing the entirety of the blame for the creation of ISIS on Obama\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Iraq. Trump, Jan. 11: \"I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed.\" This is yet another variation on Trump\u2019s campaign claim that Obama \u201cfounded ISIS,\u201d and Clinton was a \u201cco-founder.\u201d Back when we wrote about that false claim in August, experts told us the expansion of the Islamic State can\u2019t be pinned on the troop withdrawal alone \u2014 if at all. Blaming Obama for the timing of the troop withdrawal also ignores that President George W. Bush had signed the agreement and set the date for that withdrawal. Trump himself supported withdrawing troops from Iraq as early as 2007, telling CNN in a March 16, 2007, interview that the U.S. should \u201cdeclare victory and leave, because I\u2019ll tell you, this country is just going to get further bogged down. \u2026 [T]his is a total catastrophe and you might as well get out now, because you just are wasting time.\u201d Experts have pointed to a variety of actions that could have contributed to the rise of ISIS, including: the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003; the decisions by the U.S.-led provisional coalition government in 2003 to disband the Iraqi army and dissolve and ban the Baath Party, which drove Sunnis into militant groups; the rule of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose Shia government further ostracized Sunnis; the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011; the weakening of the Iraqi army, which abandoned posts in 2014 rather than fight ISIS; and the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011. Debate Questions Trump claimed that \u201cnobody even talked about it\u201d when WikiLeaks released emails from the Clinton campaign showing that \u201cHillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn\u2019t report it.\u201d Not so. There was plenty of press coverage in October when emails allegedly obtained from the account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, revealed that former CNN contributor Donna Brazile shared several town hall and debate questions with members of Clinton\u2019s campaign. According to the emails, Brazile sent multiple questions to the Clinton campaign before a CNN town hall in mid-March last year, and she sent at least one question to Clinton\u2019s campaign prior to a Democratic debate earlier that month. However, there is no evidence that Clinton herself received any questions. Trump:\u00a0\"We talk about the hacking and hacking\u2019s bad and it shouldn\u2019t be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking. \"That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn\u2019t report it? That\u2019s a horrible thing. That\u2019s a horrible thing. \"Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate \u2014 it would\u2019ve been the biggest story in the history of stories. And they would\u2019ve said immediately, 'You have to get out of the race.' Nobody even talked about it. It\u2019s a very terrible thing.\" Politico and others reported that the hacked emails showed that Brazile sent an email on March 12, 2016, to Clinton campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri with the subject line, \u201cFrom time to time, I get the questions in advance.\u201d In the email, Brazile wrote \u201chere\u2019s one that worries me about HRC,\u201d referring to Clinton. She then provided the text of a question about the death penalty. Clinton was later asked a similar question by an audience member introduced by TV One host Roland Martin, who was the co-moderator of the CNN town hall on March 13 . The emails show that Brazile wrote that she would \u201csend a few more\u201d questions to the campaign, which she did. According to Politico , an additional email shows that Brazile forwarded the campaign at least two more town hall questions \u2014 one about unions and another about income inequality. Clinton was asked the question about unions, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,\u00a0 was asked about income inequality in the town hall. There were also multiple news reports on another instance of Brazile tipping off the Clinton campaign to a potential question the day before a Democratic debate between Clinton and Sanders on March 6 in Flint, Mich. In that email, Brazile tells Podesta and Palmieri that \u201cone of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.\u201d Brazile added: \u201cShe will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.\u201d During the debate, Lee-Anne Walters, whose children experienced health problems after exposure to contaminated water in Flint, asked Clinton and Sanders \u201cwill you make a personal promise to me right now that, as president, in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States, and notification made to the \u2014 the citizens that have said service lines.\u201d What we don\u2019t know is whether Clinton, herself, was ever made aware of the questions, as Trump claimed. In her reply to Brazile\u2019s email about the question on the death penalty, Palmieri indicated that that was a question that Clinton was already prepared to answer because she had heard it before. \u201cHi. Yes, it is one she gets asked about. Not everyone likes her answer but can share it,\u201d Palmieri wrote. She then asked another campaign official to forward to Brazile Clinton\u2019s standard response on the death penalty. CNN cut all ties with Brazile, the acting DNC director, on Oct. 14, three days after the first press reports on the controversy. \u201cWe are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,\u201d a CNN spokeswoman said in a statement.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Pentagon could be poised for a rapid about-face under the Trump administration, with the Obama administration\u2019s push for social reform surrendering to what could be an old-school emphasis on combat readiness and the spirit of the United States military, experts told FoxNews.com. Under President Obama, the military sought to integrate transgender persons into the ranks, allow women into special operations forces and purge the nomenclature of gender-specific words, adopting what some critics say was a \u201cpolitically correct\u201d liberal agenda. That\u2019s a contrast to the traditional U.S. military approach. In addition, some Navy ships have been named for civil rights activists.\u00a0 And while the Obama administration has taken an inclusive approach on some issues, it has also worked to minimize expressions of Christianity in the ranks. For example, several officers have been disciplined for displaying Bibles or gospel verses in their quarters. Veterans and military experts told FoxNews.com that, while some of Obama\u2019s civil rights advancements may be locked in, neither Trump nor his choice for secretary of defense, Gen. James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, are likely to make social experimentation a priority. \u201cHere in [the Pentagon], we don\u2019t say merry Christmas, and I think we have been misguided when it comes to our history and who we are as a nation, and political correctness is indicative of that,\u201d Department of Defense contractor and retired Army Col. Robert Maginnis told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt has struck this building in a big way and we need to get away from that. Our focus is defending this country, and we should not spend so much time on social engineering.\u201d Mattis, who on Thursday goes before the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of his confirmation process, will likely \u201cbring the warrior ethos back to the Pentagon,\u201d Maginnis said. That mentality was \u201cdrained by the Obama administration,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to be known as a good soldier or Marine and not by your sexuality, your gender or your particular faith. We need everyone to pull in the same direction and not espouse a particular personal agenda that doesn\u2019t fit into the nation\u2019s best long-term interest.\u201d Retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News contributor, said the strong emphasis on social reform in the last eight years sometimes came at the expense of the military\u2019s core objective. \u201cSocial engineering was a distractor from what the main mission of the United States military was about,\u201d Keane said. \u201cWe were involved in conflict and war, and these reforms achieved a level of prominence that subordinated the issue of war itself.\u201d A spokesperson for the outgoing Obama Department of Defense said Pentagon Secretary Ash Carter has \u201cmade it clear\u201d that he will let the incoming administration make their own policy decisions, despite disagreements. \u201cThe principle, put simply by Secretary Carter, is that if a service member wants to serve and is qualified to serve, and meets requirements to serve in that position, they should do so, and that is the principle that underlines all of this,\u201d the spokesperson told FoxNews.com. \u201cBut it is entirely up to the next Administration and we are focused on ensuring they have all of the support that we can provide to ensure they enjoy a smooth, seamless transition.\u201d Under a Mattis-led Department of Defense, Maginnis expects the issue of women in combat to be re-visited. One year ago Secretary of Defense Ash Carter opened direct land combat jobs in the infantry and special operations to women. Last year, Mattis said women should not be in combat because, if they were, the nation\u2019s enemies wouldn\u2019t fear \u201cAmerica\u2019s awesome determination to defend herself.\u201d He said physical standards for combat jobs would become more lax, and women would not have privacy for their \u201cbodily functions.\u201d In a book on civilian-military relations, co-edited with Kori Schake, Mattis warned of the danger of civilian leaders with a \u201cprogressive agenda.\u201d His book also warns that \u201can uninformed public is permitting political leaders to impose an accretion of social conventions that are diminishing the combat power of our military.\u201d That\u2019s an opinion Maginnis agrees with. \u201cPolitical appointees have a lot of political persuasion,\u201d Maginnis said. \u201cThey are essentially political animals kowtowing to their political masters who have an agenda.\u201d \u201cI think the seriousness Mattis will bring to this building will be translated through every policy we begin to execute,\u201d Maginnis said. \u201cI think he will put a stamp on the organization that will be positive \u2013 no more political correctness, just a focus on being warriors.\u201d In addition to facing the normal confirmation process, Mattis needs a waiver from the legal requirement to have been out of uniform for seven years before accepting a political appointment. President-elect Trump also appointed Florida Panthers owner and billionaire Vincent Viola as secretary of the Army. Viola, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., achieved the rank of major in the U.S. Army Reserves, but has spent much of his career as one of the nation\u2019s foremost leaders in electronic trading. That career background contrasts to that of current Army Secretary Eric Fanning, most of whose work has been in the public sector and is the first openly gay head of any branch of the U.S. military.

    "text": "AP January 11, 2017, 11:02 AM Trump's proposed commission on vaccine safety alarms doctors Activist author Robert F. Kennedy Jr. takes part in a panel discussion following a screening of the film \u201cTrace Amounts\u201d on March 24, 2015 in New York City. Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Trace Amounts Email WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is reviving long debunked attempts to link vaccines to autism , meeting with a vocal skeptic to discuss chairing a commission on vaccination safety -- a move that alarmed child health experts. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, and told reporters that he had agreed to lead the effort, whatever form it takes. \u201cPresident-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies and he has questions about it,\u201d Kennedy said, adding that \u201cwe ought to be debating the science.\u201d To pediatricians, there\u2019s nothing left to debate. \u201cVaccines have been part of the fabric of our society for decades and are the most significant medical innovation of our time,\u201d Drs. Fernando Stein and Karen Remley of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement Tuesday. Robert DeNiro and the Tribeca Film Festival pulled a controversial documentary from its upcoming lineup. It is called \u201cVaxxed: From Cover Up to C... Scientists have ruled out a link between vaccines and autism. But Kennedy, the son of the late U.S. attorney general and senator, has long argued that vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal may cause autism, and has advocated for parents to more easily opt out of childhood vaccinations. Trump also has voiced vaccine skepticism, on Twitter and during one of the primary debates when he said that autism has gotten \u201ctotally out of control.\u201d In that debate he went on to say, \u201cI am totally in favor of vaccines, but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.\u201d A Trump spokeswoman said late Tuesday that while he \u201cenjoyed\u201d his conversation with Kennedy, he had not yet commissioned a panel. \u201cThe president-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time,\u201d said Hope Hicks. Those are views unsupported by scientific evidence and dismissed as conspiracy theory by experts who find their revival alarming. Vaccination prevents millions of deaths around the world each year. Once common childhood killers can return if support for immunization wanes: During a 2015 measles outbreak that started at Disneyland , many who fell ill were unvaccinated. Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no evidence that vaccines in general or those with thimerosal cause autism. That preservative has been removed from routine childhood immunizations; while it remains in some flu vaccines , there are thimerosal-free versions. \u201cThe science has spoken. Thimerosal is a dead issue,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a critic of anti-vaccine groups. \u201cIt is concerning. You have as a president-elect a science denialist.\u201d Beyond thimerosal, research has discredited concerns that children get too many vaccines at once. \u201cDelaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease,\u201d said Stein and Remley of the pediatricians\u2019 group. It\u2019s not just children who gain, they noted: Widespread vaccination lowers the spread of disease that also threatens the elderly or people with weak immune systems. lt\u2019s not clear what Kennedy described as a \u201ccommission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity\u201d would do. Already, there is a National Vaccine Advisory Committee that advises the government on vaccine safety and other issues, in addition to regulation and oversight by scientists at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The American Academy of Pediatrics offered to work with the incoming Trump administration \u201cto share the extensive scientific evidence demonstrating the safety of vaccines.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

    "text": "News Nation & World National politics In first news conference since election, defiant Trump denies reports on Russia ties President-elect Donald Trump holds his first news conference since July 27, 2016, on Jan. 11, 2017, in New York City. Tribune news services Contact Reporter A defiant President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday adamantly denied reports that Russia had obtained compromising personal and financial information about him, calling it a \"tremendous blot\" on the record of the intelligence community if such material had been released. The incoming president, in his first news conference since late July, firmly chided news organizations for publishing the material late Tuesday night. After weeks of scoffing at reports that Russians had interfered in the election, he conceded publicly for the first time that Russia was likely responsible for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. \"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\" he said and quickly added that the United States is hacked by other countries as well, including China. Trump's extraordinary defense against the unsubstantiated intelligence report, just nine days before his inauguration, dominated a highly anticipated press conference in which he also announced a new Cabinet member, detailed his plans to disentangle himself from his sprawling global business empire, gave his outlook on the future of the \"Obamacare\" health care law and said he would soon nominate someone to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \"I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out. I saw the information, I read the information outside of that meeting,\" he said, a reference to a classified briefing he received from intelligence leaders. \"It's all fake news, it's phony stuff, it didn't happen,\" Trump said in a news conference that saw him repeatedly joust with reporters. \"It was gotten by opponents of ours.\" Asked about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump boasted that it is an improvement over what he called America's current \"horrible relationship with Russia\" and did not criticize the Russian leader for any interference in the election. \"If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks, that's called an asset not a liability. I don't know if I'm going to get along with Vladimir Putin \u2014 I hope I do \u2014 but there's a good chance I won't.\" Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer also denounced the report about Russia's influence on Trump, and the incoming president said it never should have been released. He thanked some news organizations for showing restraint. Tribune news services Donald Trump 's business will continue to pursue deals in the United States, though not abroad, while he is president, and he will relinquish control of the company, a lawyer who worked with the Trump Organization on the plan said Wednesday.

Donald Trump 's business will continue to pursue deals in the United States, though not abroad, while he is president, and he will relinquish control of the company, a lawyer who worked with the Trump Organization on the plan said Wednesday. Trump will put his business assets in a trust and take... (Tribune news services) A U.S. official told The Associated Press on Tuesday night that intelligence officials had informed Trump last week about an unsubstantiated report that Russia had obtained compromising personal and financial information about him. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter. Trump and President Barack Obama were briefed on the intelligence community's findings last week, the official said. Media outlets reported on the document late Tuesday and Trump denounced it on Twitter before his news conference as \"fake news,\" suggesting he was being persecuted for defeating other GOP presidential hopefuls and Democrat Hillary Clinton in the election. The dossier contains unproven information about close coordination between Trump's inner circle and Russians about hacking into Democratic accounts as well as unproven claims about unusual sexual activities by Trump among other suggestions attributed to anonymous sources. The Associated Press has not authenticated any of the claims. ",

    "text": "Jeff Sessions Dismisses Racism Claim, Hints at What Trump Justice Department Might Look Like Echoing a denial made by Trump Tuesday, Peskov said the release of the documents, which have apparently been circulating among U.S. intelligence officials for months, was part of a \"witch hunt\" against the president-elect. The explosive but unsubstantiated allegations detonated in the U.S. news media Tuesday after CNN reported that U.S. intelligence officials had briefed Trump on the contents of the documents and informed him they were investigating the claims in it that Russia has compromising materials on him. The collection of memos was written by a former spy from Britain\u2019s intelligence services who was commissioned by Republican and Democrat operatives to investigate Trump during the presidential campaign . The British former agent passed them to the FBI during the summer. The memos have been circulating among journalists since around then, after party operatives distributed them, including to ABC News, but most news outlets had deferred releasing them because the claims, often potentially highly defamatory, could not be confirmed. The memos paint Trump as colluding directly with Moscow in an operation to defeat Clinton and tip the election to him. The materials allege that Russia has cultivated Trump for years and that it had succeeded in collecting compromising material about him when he visited Moscow in 2013 to hold the Miss Universe pageant. Most spectacularly, the memos allege that Trump\u2019s top campaign officials worked closely with Kremlin officials to coordinate the hacking of Democratic Party organizations and the release of stolen material intended to embarrass Clinton. Trump and advisers from his team mentioned in the memos have rejected them as absurd fakes. \u201cFAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter , shortly after the documents became widely available. FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Donald Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway today called the allegations \u201cnonsense from the internet.\u201d Michael Cohen, a Trump lawyer and campaign adviser, denied a specific claim in the documents that during the election campaign he had flown to Prague in the Czech Republic to meet secretly with Russian officials to discuss the hacks on the Clinton campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually walked the land in Prague, and last August I was not in Prague,\u201d Cohen told ABC News. The memos do not provide any supporting materials to back up the allegations, beyond statements from anonymous sources supposedly close to senior Russian officials. But U.S. officials have told ABC News it had become difficult to ignore them as Trump continued to make positive statements about Putin, even as American intelligence agencies alleged the Kremlin had mounted a major cyberoperation to interfere with U.S. elections. Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday pressed FBI Director James Comey on whether he had conducted an investigation into the allegations. Comey declined to answer, citing agency policy, but a senior official briefed on the issue said the allegations were too serious to ignore. The memos were reportedly raised in a classified briefing given separately by America\u2019s top intelligence officials to President Obama and Trump last week on the Russian effort to interfere in the presidential race. A declassified summary of the intelligence report presented to Trump was released publicly last week and accused Moscow of running an unprecedented operation involving the release of Democratic Party documents, as well as a state propaganda campaign intended to undermine Clinton and bolster Trump. Trump has previously mostly mocked that judgment by the U.S. intelligence agencies, though he accepted after the briefing that Russia may have been involved. The claims in the memos, though, are far more extraordinary and U.S. intelligence officials have said they have struggled to confirm them. The memos allege the Kremlin began targeting Trump as many as eight years ago, hoping to use him to disrupt the U.S. political system. The Kremlin and other Russians officials today said that was absurd. \u201cThere\u2019s, of course, no kompromat,\u201d Nikita Kovalev, a former chief of Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence service and now a member of parliament, told the Interfax news agency, using the Russian word for secret materials collected for political blackmail. \"Collecting kompromat on a person whose has come and is occupied with conducting a beauty contest; who is that interesting for?\u201d asked Kovalev, who ran the FSB from 1996-1998, long before Trump\u2019s 2013 visit. \u201cIn Russia, I can say from my own experience that we don't have such practices.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Jim Puzzanghera President-elect Donald Trump's plan to let his sons run his business drew a biting attack Wednesday from the\u00a0federal government's top ethics official, who said Trump is setting a bad example for the rest of government. Walter M. Shaub, Jr., director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said in remarks at the Brookings Institution that Trump\u2019s \u201cperplexing\u201d plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting and that every president in the past four decades has met.\u201d Trump said he would retain ownership of his businesses but step back from running them, placing them in a trust to be run by sons Donald Jr. and Eric. He and his attorney said Wednesday that the plan would mean he has no involvement in decisions and little information about what his sons are doing. Shaub said that didn't solve anything. \u201cThe only thing this has in common with a blind trust is the label \u2018trust,'\" Shaub said. \u201cHis sons are still running the businesses, and, of course, he knows what he owns.\u201d \u201cStepping back from running his\u00a0business is meaningless from a conflict-of-interest perspective,\u201d Shaub said, adding that it is \u201cquite obviously not true\u201d that the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest. Just because the federal conflict-of-interest law doesn\u2019t apply to the president doesn\u2019t mean no conflicts will occur, he said. \u201cFor that reason, it\u2019s been the consistent policy of the executive branch that the president should act as though the financial conflict-of-interest law applied,\u201d Shaub said. Shaub, a former deputy general counsel at the nonpartisan agency, was nominated by President Obama and confirmed\u00a0by the Senate for a five-year term that ends next year. He said he was speaking out in hopes that \u201csome constructive feedback\u201d from the office could encourage Trump to change his plan. He also pushed back on an argument from Trump's lawyer that it would be unfair to expect Trump to dump\u00a0his businesses at a \"fire sale.\" \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that the president is now entering the world of public service,\u201d Shaub said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk\u00a0their lives in conflicts around the world. So, no, I don\u2019t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the\u00a0president.\u201d ",

By Lisa Rein January 11 at 6:45 PM Follow @Reinlwapo Walter Shaub, head of the Government Ethics Office The head of the federal Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday denounced President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plan to separate the presidency from his business empire as \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d and said it does not meet the standards met by the \u201cbest of his nominees.\u201d \u201cThe ethics program starts at the top,\u201d Director Walter Shaub said at a Brookings Institution forum in Washington. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk creating the perception that government officials will use their positions for personal profit.\u201d The unusual and lengthy statement from the government\u2019s top ethics lawyer came hours after Trump outlined plans to shift his assets into a trust managed by his sons and give up management of his private company. Shaub said that Trump should place all of his assets in a blind trust instead to avoid potential conflicts of interest in the White House, echoing arguments that ethics lawyers have made in recent weeks. \u201cThis is not a blind trust,\u201d Shaub said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even close.\u201d [Tr ump announces plan to shift assets and management of his company\u00a0 ] Shaub, whose staff is poring over the financial holdings of Trump\u2019s nominees for Cabinet posts, was unusual in his public condemnation of the incoming president. He praised former ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, for putting his vast retirement package into a trust that will be independently managed\u00a0and cannot invest in\u00a0the company he headed. \u201cIt\u2019s a sterling model for what we\u2019d like to see with other nominees,\u201d Shaub said. Then he added: \u201cThe cost is often greater\u00a0the higher up you go.\u201d Shaub said Trump \u201cstill has time\u201d to resolve his ethical conflicts properly. He also spoke for the first time about a tweetstorm\u00a0 from his office\u00a0a few weeks after the election. The tweets congratulated Trump on divesting himself of his business holdings and were composed, public records requests have revealed, by Shaub himself. But the president-elect had not, and still has not, agreed to that plan. Shaub said Wednesday that he was \u201ctrying to use the vernacular of the president\u2019s favorite social media platform to encourage him to divest\u201d when he sent the tweets. The ethics office does not have enforcement power, so there is not much Shaub can do to force Trump\u2019s hand on his business conflicts. \u201cBut public outcry can make a difference,\u201d said Norman Eisen, a Brookings fellow who served in the Obama White House from 2009 to 2011 as special counsel and special assistant to the president, helping lead the administration\u2019s ethics policies. Eisen and\u00a0Richard Painter, the chief ethics lawyer for former president George W. Bush, led the Brookings event. powerpost ",

Chris Hondros/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chris Hondros/Getty Images Most restaurants are required to post calorie counts on menus as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The question is whether they help you resist that doughnut. Chris Hondros/Getty Images The outcome of the repeal-and-replace Obamacare debate could affect more than you might think, depending on just how the GOP congressional majority pursues its goal. Beyond the Affordable Care Act's marquee achievements like guaranteeing health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on parents' plans until age 26, the roughly 2,000-page law created a host of other provisions that affect the health of nearly every American. Some of these measures are evident every day. Some enjoy broad support, even though people often don't always realize they spring from the statute. Here's a sampling of sleeper provisions that could potentially land on the cutting-room floor: Calorie counts at restaurants and fast-food chains Feeling hungry? The law tries to give you more information about what that burger or muffin will cost you in terms of calories, part of an effort to combat the ongoing obesity epidemic. Under the ACA, most restaurants and fast food chains with at least 20 stores must post calorie counts of their menu items. Several states, including New York, already had similar rules before the law. Article continues after sponsorship Although there was some pushback, the rule had industry support, possibly because posting calories was seen as less onerous than such things as taxes on sugary foods or beverages. The final rule went into effect in December after a one-year delay. One thing is still not clear: Does simply seeing that a particular muffin has more than 400 calories cause consumers to choose carrot sticks instead? Results are mixed. One large meta-analysis done before the law went into effect didn't show a significant reduction in calorie consumption, although the authors concluded that menu labeling is \"a relatively low-cost education strategy that may lead consumers to purchase slightly fewer calories.\" Private breast-milk pumping space at work Breast-feeding, but going back to work? The law requires employers to provide women break time to express milk for up to a year after giving birth and provide someplace other than a restroom to do so in private. In addition, most health plans must offer breast-feeding support and equipment, such as pumps, without a patient copayment. Limits on surprise medical bills from ER visits If you find yourself in an emergency room, short on cash, uninsured or not sure if your insurance covers costs at that hospital, the Affordable Care Act provides some limited assistance . If you are in a hospital that is not part of your insurer's network, the law requires all health plans to charge consumers the same copayments or co-insurance for out-of-network emergency care as they do for hospitals within their networks. Still, the hospital could \"balance bill\" you for its costs, including ER care, that exceed what your insurer reimburses it. If it's a nonprofit hospital, and about 78 percent of all hospitals are, the law requires it to post online a written financial assistance policy , spelling out whether it offers free or discounted care and the eligibility requirements for such programs. While not prescribing any particular set of eligibility requirements, the law requires hospitals to charge lower rates to patients who are eligible for their financial assistance programs. That's compared with their gross charges, also known as chargemaster rates. Community health support from nonprofit hospitals The health law also requires nonprofit hospitals to justify the billions of dollars in tax exemptions they receive by documenting how they go about trying to improve the health of the community around them. Every three years, these hospitals have to perform a community needs assessment for the area the hospital serves. They also have to develop strategies to meet these needs and update them annually. The hospitals then must provide documentation as part of their annual reporting to the Internal Revenue Service. Failure to comply could leave them liable for a $50,000 penalty. A woman's right to choose her OB-GYN Most insurance plans must allow women to seek care from an obstetrician-gynecologist without having to get a referral from a primary care physician. While the majority of states already had such protections in place, those laws did not apply to self-insured plans, which are the type often offered by large employers. The health law extended the rules to all new plans. Proponents say direct access makes it easier for women to seek not only reproductive health care, but also screening for such things as high blood pressure or cholesterol. Expanded therapy coverage for children with autism Advocates for children with autism and people with degenerative diseases argued that many insurance plans did not provide care their families needed. That's because insurers would cover rehabilitation to help people regain functions they had lost, such as walking again after a stroke, but not care needed to either gain functions patients never had, such as speech therapy for a child who never learned how to talk, or to maintain a patient's current level of function. The Affordable Care Act requires plans to offer coverage for such treatments, dubbed habilitative care , as part of the essential health benefits in plans sold to individuals and small groups.

    "text": "Ice Cube wanted to keep watching his favorite players so he founded a 3-on-3 basketball league Ice Cube wanted to keep watching his favorite players so he founded a 3-on-3 basketball league By Ted Berg January 11, 2017 6:45 pm Follow     @ogtedberg 110 shares Follow @ogtedberg NEW YORK \u2014 Ice Cube wasn\u2019t done watching Kobe Bryant play basketball, so he created a new professional league where guys like Kobe Bryant can play basketball. You can do stuff like that if you\u2019re Ice Cube. But if Ice Cube weren\u2019t the type of guy to fully dedicate himself to developing his ideas, he\u2019d hardly be Ice Cube at all: Cube could have rested on his NWA laurels and faded into cultural obscurity a quarter-century ago, but instead started his own label and recorded a bunch of platinum-selling solo albums and got into acting and writing for film and ultimately turned himself into the full-blown Hollywood movie star he is today. So the man born O\u2019Shea Jackson, now 47 years old but still operating under the handle he created as a teenager, is all-in on the BIG3, a new 3-on-3 pro basketball league he co-founded with partner Jeff Kwatinetz set to kick off on June 24. Ice Cube and Kwatinetz had discussed the idea of a professional 3-on-3 half-court circuit in the past, but Bryant\u2019s retirement at the end of the 2016 season hastened the efforts. The league will consist of eight teams of five players each, with notable former NBA stars including Allen Iverson, Kenyon Martin and Rashard Lewis \u2014 all of whom attended the league\u2019s kick-off event in Manhattan on Wednesday \u2014 serving as player-coaches and selecting rosters full of their once and future colleagues. \u201cI had been thinking about this for a minute,\u201d Ice Cube said, \u201cbut seeing Kobe retire just made me want to kick it into high gear, because I think he\u2019s still got game. I started writing notes down, putting concepts and thoughts down. \u201cThis started off as a dream. It sucks to see your favorite players retire. It\u2019s a great business opportunity, but as a fan, I\u2019m just excited to see the guys that I know can play at a competitive level, and I\u2019m happy that I have the right type of partners to be able to set the stage for that. We grew up watching these guys. We\u2019ve seen their ups and downs, we\u2019ve seen them win games and they become part of our everyday life in some ways. And then we look up, and they\u2019re gone. It\u2019s like losing a family friend or a loved one. Ice Cube, I\u2019ve got my heroes, too, and a lot of them play professional basketball.\u201d (Left to right: Allen Iverson, Kenyon Martin; Roger Mason Jr., Jeff Kwatinetz, Ice Cube and Rashard Lewis (PHOTO: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for BIG3) BIG3 games will take place only once a week, on Saturdays throughout the summer. All four games every week will take place in the same location, with the location changing every week \u2014 Kwatinetz mentioned targeting cities like Seattle, no longer served by the NBA, as well as places like New York that could be expected to have an appetite for basketball in the summer months. Games will end whenever the first team reaches 60 points, and will incorporate a trio of 4-point circles beyond the traditional three-point line. Though all involved stressed the emphasis on fostering competitive basketball, the weekly events will come with an entertainment component, with halftime shows, individualized player introductions, and opportunities for fans to mingle with players. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a party,\u201d Kwatinetz said. Beyond the spectacle, there\u2019s an interesting twist: The league will include no team owners, and teams will compete for the largest portion of the players\u2019 share of the BIG3\u2019s revenue, with the players and coach on the first-place team splitting 30% of the pool. Winnings for the second through eighth-place clubs will also be pursuant to their positions in the standings at the end of the season. \u201cI think a real milestone in the idea was when we thought of having no owners, and that the players would get in the revenue sharing,\u201d Ice Cube said. \u201cI think that was a moment when we thought, \u2018Yo, this is not only a cool concept, but players can make a lot of money \u2014 especially if we built this pot how we know it can grow.\u2019 So it just started looking like a great business model, and a great thing to put full effort into.\u201d \u201cOur goal as a brand and my goal in this role will be to form the most player and fan-centric professional sports league,\u201d said Roger Mason Jr., a former NBA player turned players union executive now serving as the BIG3\u2019s president and commissioner. \u201cThe proof is in that payout structure. That was totally Cube and Jeff\u2019s concept and idea. I thought it was brilliant \u2014 I thought it baked up what they said about this being a player\u2019s league.\u201d (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for BIG3) With Kwatinetz and Mason, Ice Cube played a huge and very hands-on role in developing the league, from determining the rules and payout structure to recruiting its player-coaches. \u201cCube is a true icon, but what makes him special is the sincerity and authenticity,\u201d Kwatinetz said. \u201cHe would never get behind something he doesn\u2019t believe in, and that he wouldn\u2019t devote tireless efforts to.\u201d \u201cWhen I got the call, it was a no-brainer,\u201d Iverson said. \u201cIt\u2019s Ice Cube. It\u2019s O\u2019Shea. You don\u2019t turn that down. That\u2019s success looking right into your eyes. I just wanted to be a part of it, and I hope me being a part of it makes it a success, like everything that he\u2019s been doing in his life.\u201d Asked about forthcoming projects in music or movies, Cube said his current focus is solely on basketball. \u201cAll I can see is this right now, and making sure that this works,\u201d he said. \u201cJune 24 will be here quick. I\u2019ve got my head down. I know other people probably want me to get back into my movies and stuff like that, but this is my baby right now.\u201d More NBA! ",

Sarina Jepsen/AP hide caption toggle caption The U.S. has designated the rusty patched bumblebee an endangered species. Sarina Jepsen/AP The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated the rusty patched bumblebee an endangered species \u2014 the first such designation for a bumblebee and for a bee species in the continental U.S. The protected status, which goes into effect on Feb. 10, includes requirements for federal protections and the development of a recovery plan. It also means that states with habitats for this species are eligible for federal funds. \"Today's Endangered Species listing is the best\u2014and probably last\u2014hope for the recovery of the rusty patched bumble bee,\" NRDC Senior Attorney Rebecca Riley said in a statement from the Xerces Society, which advocates for invertebrates. \"Bumble bees are dying off, vanishing from our farms, gardens, and parks, where they were once found in great numbers.\" Large parts of the Eastern and Midwestern United States were once crawling with these bees, Bombus affinis, but the bees have suffered a dramatic decline in the last two decades due to habitat loss and degradation, along with pathogens and pesticides. Indeed, the bee was found in 31 states and Canadian provinces before the mid- to late-1990s, according to the final rule published in the Federal Register . But since 2000, it has been reported in only 13 states and Ontario, Canada. It has seen an 88 percent decline in the number of populations and an 87 percent loss in the amount of territory it inhabits. Article continues after sponsorship Bees Added To U.S. Endangered Species List For 1st Time This means the species is vulnerable to extinction, the rule says, even without further habitat loss or insecticide exposure. Canada designated the species as endangered in 2012. The bees live in large colonies that can be made up of 1,000 individual workers. All types of the species have black heads, the rule states, \"but only workers and males have a rusty reddish patch centrally located on the abdomen.\" Habitat degradation may be particularly harmful to these bees because of their feeding habits, as described in the rule: \"The rusty patched bumble bee is one of the first bumble bees to emerge early in the spring and the last to go into hibernation, so to meet its nutritional needs, the species requires a constant and diverse supply of blooming flowers.\" Last October, the Fish and Wildlife Service gave endangered status to seven species of yellow-faced bees native to Hawaii, the first time any U.S. bees received this kind of protection. Report: More Pollinator Species In Jeopardy, Threatening World Food Supply Pollinator decline is a global trend. A recent major global assessment sponsored by the U.N. suggested that about 40 percent of invertebrate pollinator species are facing extinction. Since some 75 percent of food crops rely at least partially on pollinators, that raises serious concerns about the future of the global food supply. ",

U.S.-Mexico border Bill Wechter / AFP A pair of fences separate Mexico, left, and the U.S. south of San Diego. A pair of fences separate Mexico, left, and the U.S. south of San Diego. (Bill Wechter / AFP) North American Free Trade Agreement It\u2019s by now a\u00a0predictable pattern. Every few days, President-elect\u00a0 Donald Trump repeats his threat\u00a0to build a massive border wall \u2014 and force\u00a0Mexico to pay for it. And each time, Mexican leaders\u00a0respond the same way.\u00a0 \u201cNeither today, nor tomorrow nor never Mexico will pay for that stupid wall. If Trump wants a monument to his ego, let him pay for it!!\u201d former Mexican President Vicente Fox tweeted on Wednesday shortly after Trump made the border claim again at a news conference. \u201cThere is no way,\u201d\u00a0Luis Videgaray, Mexico\u2019s new foreign secretary , said this week. For Mexico, he said, the\u00a0wall issue is \u201ca\u00a0matter of national dignity and sovereignty.\u201d\u00a0 Trump has vowed\u00a0to begin construction on\u00a0the wall soon after his\u00a0Jan.\u00a020 inauguration. He plans to press Congress to fund the project and then find ways to have Mexico reimburse those costs later. The caustic back and forth between Trump\u00a0and top Mexican officials, which along with fears of a\u00a0trade war has\u00a0sent the value of the peso plunging,\u00a0raises the question:\u00a0Can Trump really force Mexico to pay for the wall? We talked to several experts about that \u2014\u00a0as well as\u00a0what\u00a0Trump\u2019s threats against Mexico\u00a0could mean for the economies of both countries.\u00a0 Will Trump be able to persuade Mexico to pay for the wall?\u00a0 \u201cThe Mexican government isn\u2019t willing to pay for the wall in any way,\u201d said Alfredo Couti\u00f1o, Latin America director for Moody\u2019s Analytics. Handing over billions of dollars for the construction of the wall\u00a0would be a politically\u00a0suicidal decision for Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who saw his approval ratings sink after he met with Trump in Mexico City last fall. But besides that,\u00a0there is a more practical concern.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMexico doesn\u2019t have the money to pay for it,\u201d Couti\u00f1o said. An already shaky economic and political situation was made more unstable Jan. 1 when the Mexican government deregulated gasoline prices. Gas prices rose as much as 20%, triggering angry demonstrations across the country. In recent weeks, Trump has acknowledged that it is unlikely the U.S. would receive\u00a0a direct payment from Mexico, whose economy has been plagued by slow growth and rising inflation.\u00a0 \u201cMexico, in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us, and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall,\u201d Trump\u00a0said Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cThat will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment.\u201d \u201cProbably less likely that it's a payment,\u201d he added. \u00a0 (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times) How could the U.S. try to recoup the costs? One way is taxing remittances, an idea Trump has floated in the past.\u00a0 In 2015, Mexico received nearly $25\u00a0billion in remittances from citizens living outside the country, most of them from the U.S.,\u00a0according to the Bank of Mexico, the country\u2019s central banking system. Trump has suggested much of that money is sent\u00a0from people who are living in the United States illegally, although according to PolitiFact,\u00a0 there is no way \u00a0to track the legal status of remittance senders. If Trump pushed Congress to approve, say, a\u00a010% tax on remittances, that could generate $10 billion dollars for the U.S. government over four years.\u00a0 Trump could \u201cslice and dice\u201d the situation to make it appear that Mexico is paying a tax to fund a border wall, said\u00a0Edward Alden, a senior fellow specializing in U.S. trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. But ultimately, it would be Mexican immigrants who were paying. \u201cIt\u2019s an ugly and regressive tax, because you\u2019re essentially taxing poor people,\u201d Alden said. Is there a precedent for taxing remittances?\u00a0 Yes, at least on the state level. Since 2009,\u00a0Oklahoma has charged a 1% fee \u2014 critics call it a tax \u2014 on all personal wire transfers of cash to accounts outside the state. The fee is a withholding on state income tax, and when residents file taxes, they eventually get the money back. However, those in the country illegally who send money abroad\u00a0do not receive the cash back \u2014 a move that in effect taxes them.\u00a0 Could the U.S. only target remittances sent to Mexico? That could be difficult. Any federal tax on remittances probably would have to be applied across the board to people sending money to all countries, analysts say. \u201cTaxing one specific group of people on their remittances could be considered discriminatory,\u201d said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington. What about Trump\u2019s pledge to tax imports from Mexico? With the help of Congress, Trump could immediately impose new taxes on goods imported to the U.S. from Mexico. He could claim that is one way Mexico is paying the costs of the wall. But new taxes could draw lawsuits, Wilson said,\u00a0because the\u00a0 North American Free Trade Agreement \u00a0bars the U.S. from assessing tariffs on goods made in Canada or Mexico. Trump has pledged to immediately start renegotiating\u00a0that deal to make it more fair for American workers, but that process could stretch years.\u00a0 How would changes to free trade deals\u00a0affect the economy?\u00a0 Canceling or making serious changes to NAFTA could paralyze major American industries, like the automotive and food and beverage industries,\u00a0Courti\u00f1o said. If that happens,\u00a0\u201cthe U.S. runs the risk of going into recession.\u201d\u00a0 The consequences for Mexico also could be devastating. \u201cMexico would almost certainly\u00a0go into recession,\u201d Couti\u00f1o said, because Mexico\u2019s\u00a0faltering economy wouldn\u2019t allow officials to\u00a0lower interest rates and pump money into the economy like U.S. leaders did during the Great Recession. A recession in Mexico, Courti\u00f1o said, could unleash major unintended consequences in the U.S. that could undermine Trump\u2019s efforts to even the trade playing field and limit illegal immigration. \u201cIn indirectly inducing the weakening of the peso, Trump is making Mexican exports more attractive for American consumers,\u201d Courti\u00f1o said.\u00a0 \u201cIf you block\u00a0Mexico in terms of exports, investing and\u00a0remittances, Mexico\u2019s economy is going to sink, unemployment is going to rise, and guess what? More Mexicans are going to be willing to take the risk of crossing the border into the U.S.\u201d Courti\u00f1o said. \u201cTrump\u00a0is running the risk of increasing immigration from Mexico.\u201d This would create a certain irony.\u00a0Though Central Americans have been trying to reach the U.S. in greater numbers, net migration from Mexico has remained zero for several years, with U.S. and Mexican government data showing more people returning home to Mexico than entering the U.S. illegally each year. What can Mexico do about Trump\u2019s plans? Mexico has little say in several of the changes Trump has proposed. There is nothing Mexico could do to block a tax on\u00a0remittances. And although it could impose trade tariffs on imports from the U.S., that would not have a big effect because Mexico exports more than it imports.\u00a0 Although Mexico could withhold\u00a0cooperation with U.S. officials on security issues and immigration enforcement at Mexico\u2019s southern border as a bargaining chip, neither of those things is in Mexico\u2019s interest, experts say.\u00a0 \u201cMexico,\u201d Courti\u00f1o said, \u201cis basically at the mercy of the U.S.\u201d \u201cThe most likely scenario is that the Trump administration will find some way to claim that they have forced Mexico to pay for the additional border fencing,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd Mexico will claim that it was paid for by Congress and the Trump administration.\u201d Linthicum reported from Mexico City and Lee from Los Angeles.

Seth Wenig/AP hide caption toggle caption President-elect Donald Trump takes questions during his first news conference since the election. Seth Wenig/AP This has been updated at 3:50 pm ET. President-elect Donald Trump denounced as \"fake news\" Wednesday reports that Russia had compromising information about him before the election. He also acknowledged for the first time that Russia was behind the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee, although he seemed to couch it later in the news conference by saying it \"could have been others.\" Trump Outlines Plan To Avoid Business Conflicts, Addresses Hacking In his first news conference since last summer, the president-elect additionally said he would be handing over control of his businesses to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric; refused once again to release his income tax returns; and said his administration would reveal its plan to replace the Affordable Care Act as soon as his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, is confirmed by the Senate. Trump said the unverified and unsubstantiated reports about the Russian intelligence were put together by political opponents, whom he called \"sick people.\" The reports, he said, were \"a disgrace,\" and he vehemently denounced BuzzFeed News, which published a 35-page memo purportedly outlining the Russian intelligence, as \"a failing pile of garbage.\" He also denied a question from a CNN reporter, which first broke the story of an intelligence report but did not publish the documents or the lewd details. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Announces David Shulkin As Pick For Secretary Of Veterans Affairs But Trump didn't answer a question as to whether his presidential campaign had been in contact with the Russian government, which the report alleged. CNN reporter Jim Acosta noted later on the network that reporters followed up on that point as Trump was heading to the elevators off camera, and Trump said no one \"associated with him or his campaign was in contact with the Russians\" during the campaign. Watch Live: Rex Tillerson Pressed On Russia At Secretary Of State Hearing Trump was also critical of U.S. intelligence agencies for \"maybe\" leaking the report to news organizations, charging that a meeting he had recently with the agencies immediately leaked out even though he had kept it secret from his closest staff. Trump said, \"I think it was Russia\" who hacked into the DNC's servers but added \"it could have been others also.\" U.S. intelligence publicly stated last October \u2014 and in congressional hearings and an unclassified report since \u2014 that the Russian government was to blame for the cyberattack. Trump called hacking \"bad\" and said he would tell Russian President Vladimir Putin \"he shouldn't have done it. I don't believe he will be doing it more.\" But he also said he would consider it \"an asset, not a liability,\" if Putin likes him. \"I don't know if I'll get along\" with the Russian leader, Trump said, \"I hope I do.\" Trump also denied taking part in any salacious behavior in a Moscow hotel room, saying he always tells people to be very careful when he travels abroad, because \"you have cameras in the strangest places. You'd better be careful or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.\" Plus, he added, \"Does anyone really believe that story? I'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way. Believe me.\" Trump held his news conference in the marble-lined lobby of Trump Tower in New York, speaking alongside a table piled with manila file folders, which he said were the agreements he has signed giving control of the Trump Organization to his oldest sons. He introduced attorney Sheri Dillon, of the firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, who said that at Trump's request she had designed a structure \"that will completely isolate him\" from the management of the company. Trump is conveying leadership and management of the company to his adult sons and longtime Trump executive Allen Weisselberg. Dillon said the three will \"make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever\" by Trump. Dillon also said the trust agreement \"imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration\" of Trump's presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through \"a vigorous vetting process.\" Trump will not be informed of such deals and will only learn of them if he \"reads it in the paper or sees it on TV.\" And, she said, Trump will donate to the U.S Treasury all profits made from foreign governments who stay at his hotel. On health care, Trump said \"the easiest thing\" would be to let the Affordable Care Act \"implode\" this year, because of increased premium rates. He said Obamacare \"is the Democrats' problem,\" but that he will offer a plan to repeal and replace that is \"gonna take the problem off the shelves for them.\" The plan will be \"far less expensive and far better,\" he said, and will be submitted almost simultaneously as his HHS secretary is confirmed. Trump also revealed he will be nominating David Shulkin as secretary of the Veterans Administration. Shulkin is currently the No. 2 at the troubled agency and would be one of the first holdovers from the Obama administration. Trump called him an incredibly gifted doctor. Trump also took a shot at the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, which he charged \"has been disastrous.\" He said drugmakers have been leaving the country left and right and that new bidding procedures are needed for the industry \"because they're getting away with murder.\" Trump's comments caused drug stocks to fall on Wall Street ",

    "text": "Volkswagen Pleads Guilty, Pays $4.3 Billion in Fines to Settle Diesel Emissions Scandal By JEFFREY COOK Jan 11, 2017, 5:02 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Volkswagen Pays $4.3 Billion to Settle Diesel Emissions Scandal 0 Shares Email Automotive giant Volkswagen AG has agreed to pay $4.3 billion in criminal and civil fines for the company's diesel emissions cheating scandal, the Justice Department and automaker announced today. A federal grand jury in Michigan has also indicted six Volkswagen employees and executives for their alleged roles in the nearly 10-year conspiracy. The company's settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice, Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are still subject to federal court approval. As part of the resolution, the German automaker agreed to the appointment of an independent monitor for three years. Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three criminal felony counts, including \u201cparticipating in a conspiracy to the defraud the United States and VW\u2019s U.S. customers and to violate the Clean Air Act by \u2026 using cheating software to circumvent\u201d the emissions testing process on some VW, Audi and Porsche diesel vehicles, according to the Department of Justice. In addition, VW has been charged with obstruction of justice \"for destroying documents related to the scheme, and with a separate crime of importing these cars into the U.S. by means of false statements about the vehicles\u2019 compliance with emissions limits,\" the Department of Justice said. \u201cVolkswagen deeply regrets the behavior that gave rise to the diesel crisis,\" CEO Matthias M\u00fcller said today in a statement. \"Since all of this came to light, we have worked tirelessly to make things right for our affected customers and have already achieved some progress on this path. We will continue to press forward with changes to our way of thinking and working.\u201d Volkswagen Announces $15B Emissions Settlement The $2.8 billion criminal penalty and $1.5 billion civil penalty bring Volkswagen's total cost to the United States to about $20 billion. The company reached settlements last year of more than $15 billion with consumers, the government and California regulators. That money is intended for buybacks, fixes, owner compensation and environmental remediation. One of the six indicted employees was taken into custody in Florida on Saturday for his alleged role in the company\u2019s suspected \"scheme\" to cheat emissions standards, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday. Oliver Schmidt, who led the automaker\u2019s U.S. environmental regulatory compliance office from 2012 to 2015, allegedly conspired with other VW employees to defraud the federal government \u2013- and American consumers -\u2013 by concealing the installation of a device designed to cheat emissions tests. Two other indicted employees, Richard Dorenkamp and Jens Hadler, allegedly created the device in 2006, after they tried -- and failed -- to design a diesel engine that would meet new U.S. emissions standards and appeal to consumers, according to the Justice Department. They then installed the device into cars marketed as \"environmentally friendly,\" the Justice Department said. All six defendants are believed to be residents of Germany, according to the Justice Department. Schmidt was arrested during a trip to the United States. VW Emissions-Cheating Deal Could Put Employees in Hot Seat The defeat device software, installed on nearly half a million diesel VW cars sold in the U.S. between 2009 and 2015, could detect when a vehicle was undergoing emissions evaluations and decrease its nitrogen oxide emissions to comply with American standards. When the software recognized the vehicle was on the road, however, it would allow emissions up to 40 times higher than permitted. The cheat device was discovered in September 2015 by researchers at West Virginia University. 0 Shares ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Matt Zapotosky January 11 at 5:40 PM Follow @mattzap Sen. Cory Booker testified Wednesday that Sen. Jeff Sessions is the wrong man to lead the Justice Department, saying the Alabama Republican\u2019s lengthy record in Congress exposed views that are inconsistent with the venerated job he is seeking. In a passionate speech from the witness table, the New Jersey Democrat ticked off issue after issue, asserting in each instance that Sessions would not seek justice as the U.S. attorney general. \u201cIf confirmed, Senator Sessions will be required to pursue justice for women, but his record indicates that he won\u2019t,\u201d Booker said. \u201cHe will be expected to defend the equal rights of gay and lesbian and transgender Americans, but his record indicates that he won\u2019t. He will be expected to defend voting rights, but his record indicates that he won\u2019t. He will be expected to defend the rights of immigrants and affirm their human dignity, but the record indicates that he won\u2019t.\u201d What lies ahead for Trump's nominees, and how Democrats helped smooth the way View Graphic What lies ahead for Trump's nominees, and how Democrats helped smooth the way In total, legislators heard testimony from 15 supporters and detractors, and Sessions answered questions over more than 101/2 hours. Nothing that was said was likely to stop the Republican-controlled Senate from confirming him, with Democrats failing to land anything close to a fatal blow during the hearing. Booker said he could not stay silent, even though he knew some colleagues \u201caren\u2019t happy that I am breaking with Senate tradition.\u201d \u201cIn the choice between standing with Senate norms or standing up for what my conscience tells me is best for our country, I will always choose conscience and country,\u201d he said. And he came after Sessions perhaps more forcefully than any witness before him. \u201cSenator Sessions has not demonstrated a commitment to a central requisite of the job \u2014 to aggressively pursue the congressional mandate of civil rights, equal rights and justice for all of our citizens,\u201d Booker said. \u201cIn fact, at numerous times in his career, he has demonstrated a hostility toward these convictions.\u201d Sessions is generally well liked in the Senate, despite views that draw polarized responses. To those in law enforcement and conservative legal circles, he is an honorable man, dedicated to enforcing the law no matter his personal feelings. To civil rights advocates, immigrant advocates and others, his record makes him a troubling selection to lead the Justice Department. Former attorney general Michael Mukasey testified Wednesday that Sessions is \u201cthoroughly dedicated to the rule of law and the mission of the department.\u201d Here are the people Trump has chosen for his Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people Trump has chosen for his Cabinet Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, said his voting record and actions \u201cdemonstrate an unwavering commitment to equal protection under the law.\u201d But David Cole, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that record \u201craises serious questions about the fitness of Senator Sessions to be an attorney general for all American people.\u201d And Amita Swadhin, a rape survivor, attacked Sessions for saying that grabbing a woman by the genitals does not necessarily constitute sexual assault. That comment by Sessions came after the a video that recorded Trump talking about such conduct went public. \u201cMillions of sexual-assault survivors were triggered in the wake of these events,\u201d Swadhin said. The senator has since said his remarks were bungled, and on Tuesday he asserted unequivocally that grabbing a woman by the genitals is sexual assault. [ Sessions emphasizes the primacy of the law over his political views ] In his testimony, Sessions sought to persuade his colleagues that he would assiduously enforce the law. He said that although his politics may indicate otherwise, he would abide by the Supreme Court decision underpinning abortion rights and would similarly follow the ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. He said he understands that the waterboarding of terrorism suspects to elicit information is \u201cabsolutely improper and illegal.\u201d Finally, he declared that he would recuse himself from any Justice Department investigations of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state or her family\u2019s charitable foundation \u2014 mindful that his previous comments \u201ccould place my objectivity in question.\u201d Trump said this of his nominee\u2019s performance: \u201cHe was brilliant.\u201d Democratic lawmakers used the witnesses to highlight some of Sessions\u2019s more controversial stances, such as his opposition to a hate-crimes bill and his expression of support for a Supreme Court decision that invalidated parts of the Voting Rights Act. Republicans, meanwhile, tried to cast those opposed to the nominee as biased and unwilling to give him a fair chance. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) debated with the ACLU\u2019s Cole over whether a critical report the group released on Sessions left out key details. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) questioned NAACP President Cornell William Brooks about his organization\u2019s low rating of Sessions, noting that virtually all Republicans received poor marks. \u201cI hope that doesn\u2019t make us all racist,\u201d Graham quipped. Oscar Vazquez told legislators how he had come to the United States with documents when he was just 12, taking a bus with his mother from Mexico. He said he always considered the United States home, but when he sought to enlist in the Army near the end of high school, a recruiter told him he couldn\u2019t, because of his immigration status. Vazquez would go on to enroll at Arizona State University, marry a U.S. citizen and \u2014 eventually \u2014 get the documentation he needed to serve in the military, including in Afghanistan. He said undocumented immigrants are worried about Sessions as attorney general, especially those who took advantage of an executive action by President Obama allowing people who came to the United States illegally as children to receive work permits. \u201cThere is a lot of fear, most of all,\u201d Vazquez said. [ Coretta Scott King\u2019s letter opposing Sessions\u2019s 1986 federal nomination ] But supporter Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, spoke of how Sessions would improve relations between federal authorities and local police and perhaps not be so quick to judge officers involved in high-profile incidents. \u201cThe lines of communications will be more direct than they have been,\u201d Canterbury said of the Justice Department under Sessions. Sessions talked Tuesday of improving morale in local police departments, which he maintained had been unfairly maligned, and he notably refused to commit to leaving unchanged consent decrees mandating changes at certain departments. On Thursday, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch is scheduled to travel to Baltimore to announce such a decree in Baltimore, where the 2015 death of a black man in police custody led to riots.

    "text": "WATCH Donald Trump Gives First Press Conference Since Becoming President-Elect 0 Shares At Trump Tower in New York, Donald Trump held his first press conference since becoming the president-elect. Here are some initial thoughts on what we witnessed today: A Wall, but No Wall Yes, Trump remains committed to a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. But when it comes to a wall between Trump and his business interests, the arrangement he announced Wednesday doesn\u2019t come close to what ethics experts have recommended. Putting his sons in charge of his empire won\u2019t provide meaningful financial separation between the president and the businesses he helped build, said Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush. Trump even bragged during the press conference about turning down a $2 billion deal in Dubai that he said he could have accepted, saying, \u201cI could actually run my business and run government at the same time.\u201d He isn\u2019t quite doing that, but there\u2019s nothing in this arrangement that could stop the perception or the reality of that happening, other than the honor system. Russia Love Notably, Trump said he now accepts that Russia was most likely behind the cyberattacks during the campaign that intelligence officials say were intended to help his candidacy. But he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to say bad things about Russian President Vladimir Putin or to even question his motives. \u201cIf Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability,\u201d Trump said. He continued to blame the Democratic National Committee for not having adequate cyberdefenses. Asked directly what his message to Putin is regarding hacking, Trump responded, \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing it. He won\u2019t be doing it.\u201d Trump\u2019s hope is that projecting U.S. strength will change the relationship with Russia. But he\u2019s still handling the bear with kid gloves. Trump Says Sons Will Take \u2018Complete and Total Control\u2019 of the Business Intel War Perhaps the harshest words Trump had for any group in his press conference were for the intelligence community. \u201cA tremendous blot on their record,\u201d he said in accusing intelligence officials of leaking details of what he\u2019s been briefed on in classified sessions. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace ... That\u2019s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.\u201d He will, of course, be the main consumer of intelligence information in nine days. He\u2019s entering the presidency in the midst of an unprecedented war of words with intelligence professionals \u2014 with real consequences soon enough. Congress? Whatever In talking about some legislative priorities, it\u2019s clear that Trump has little patience for the traditions and niceties of Congress, at least for now. He mocked Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 \u201cHe is going to crack that 1 percent barrier one day\u201d \u2014 even though Graham will be a needed ally on Capitol Hill. More significant, Trump pointed to a preferred path for repealing and replacing \u201cObamacare\u201d that isn\u2019t under serious consideration in the House or the Senate. Without offering details of how to do it, he said repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act would \u201cmost likely be on the same day or the same week but probably the same day. Could be the same hour.\u201d And he offered this unusually frank piece of advice on the issue to his own party: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to own it. We don\u2019t want to own it politically.\u201d \u2018Fake News\u2019 Belongs to Trump Too The term that\u2019s been used to describe malicious attempts to spread falsehoods and misinformation? The incoming president plans to use it as well. \u201cFake news\u201d is what Trump labeled the unsubstantiated information about him that circulated widely this week after being included in an intelligence briefing. It\u2019s also the term he used to describe news outlets that reported on that information on Tuesday. The label has been most commonly associated with efforts to influence politics through deliberate falsehoods circulated online. But Trump and his team are twisting that meaning. \u201cI think it\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to have to live with,\u201d he said of fake news. \u201cI guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back.\u201d That Was Weird Trump press conferences look as if they will be quite different from his predecessors\u2019, if today\u2019s was any indication. His long-delayed first press conference as president-elect featured props, sparring with reporters, a meandering opening statement and a long section in which a lawyer read a statement about Trump\u2019s business plans. Along the way, he dropped news tidbits about his Cabinet, Supreme Court timeline, his legislative priorities and why he would never do anything untoward in a hotel in Moscow. His exchanges with the press appear unlikely to be dull affairs. They might also be extraordinarily combative, as with his repeated refusal to allow a CNN reporter to ask a question. This ride is going to be wild. 0 Shares ",

Mr. Trump\u2019s family business has cancelled 30 pending business deals and won\u2019t enter into new international projects, such as licenses for new hotels that carry the Trump name, according to his lawyer, Sheri Dillon, who presented the new arrangement at a news conference Wednesday. The president-elect, she said, \u201cshould not be expected to destroy the company he built.\u201d Mr. Trump said he just turned down a $2 billion offer to build a hotel in Dubai. In all. cancelling the pending projects will cost the family millions, the lawyer said.\u00a0 Dillon said divesting all Mr. Trump\u2019s holdings would not work because it would constitute a \u201cfire sale,\u201d where the Trump family would get low-ball amounts. A blind trust, where all the assets are administered by a third party (that is, not by a Trump family relative), also would be impractical she added. That arrangement doesn\u2019t work for operating companies, such as those the Trump Organization oversees, Dillon said. \u00a0 Mr. Trump will receive no in-depth financial reports regarding his company detailing individual business lines, but only the overall profit and loss figures, the lawyer said.\u00a0 His holdings will be transferred into a trust overseen by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, who will make decisions without consulting the president.\u00a0 The president-elect\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, will no longer be involved in the family business, as she is joining her husband, Jared Kushner, as he moves to Washington to serve as a White House aide .\u00a0 \u201cWhen my father takes office as the 45th President of the United States of America, I will take a formal leave of absence from The Trump Organization and my eponymous apparel and accessories brand,\u201d she said in a statement, noting that she would have no role in the apparel and accessories business. Ivanka Trump said she is turning management of the clothing business to Abigail Klem, who according to her LinkedIn profile has been serving as its chief brand officer. Ongoing Trump businesses will be reviewed by an internal ethics officer to make sure they are done without his involvement or knowledge. The company will channel foreign government payments to his hotels to the U.S. Treasury, Dillon. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved. ",

He left with hundreds more. Trump announced a new ethics plan to avoid conflicts of interest with his vast business holdings, but experts are already warning that it's woefully inadequate and could violate the Constitution. He offered inconsistent answers on a variety of topics related to Russia and he provided limited guidance on health care reform, even as Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare are stalling over disagreements on the timing and substance of legislation.

Hours later, Buzzfeed published an unverified dossier from a non-government source claiming to detail Russia's efforts to cultivate Trump -- including by direct interactions with Trump surrogates -- and to collect damaging material about him. Related: Donald Trump Wasn't Told About Unverified Russia Dossier, Official Says NBC News reported that the material in question was prepared for the briefing but, according to a U.S. Intelligence official with knowledge of the briefing preparation, Trump was not personally briefed on that information, which was originally generated as part of anti-Trump Republican opposition research. Here are some of the big questions coming out of Trump's first news conference as president-elect. Does Trump's ethics plan actually solve anything? Trump brought a lawyer, Sheri Dillon, to outline a plan for the president-elect to avoid conflicts of interest as president and his team briefed reporters on its details before the event. But legal experts who have been raising the alarm about Trump's business for months say the new plan did little to address their concerns. \"The president-elect's disregard for ethics and precedent and the Constitution in his press conference today is going to precipitate an ethics and a Constitutional crisis from the day he's sworn in,\" Norm Eisen, a Brookings fellow and former White House ethics lawyer under President Obama, told MSNBC. The main plank of Trump's plan is to turn his business over to his sons to run, place his assets in a trust (but not a \"blind trust\" typically used by politicians), and appoint officers at his company to vet deals for potential conflicts.

Since Trump still owns his business empire, it's possible for foreign actors or domestic interests to try and influence him by padding his company's profits. Making matters worse, his sons, rather than an independent caretaker, still have direct control over his business, offering him very little distance from its operations. Trump's lawyers say he will not be allowed to request detailed information on his business, but someone could potentially buy a property at a high price, or arrange a favorable loan for his sons, or invest in a major project, and then tell Trump themselves. \"Foreigners and others will continue to be able to ingratiate themselves by doing business with Trump organizations, which enriches Trump,\" Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University specializing in ethics, told NBC News. \"It's really quite simple.\" Oddly enough, Trump offered a perfect illustration of potential conflicts at his press conference by announcing that he had recently turned down a $2 billion deal from a Dubai investor. Under his plan, Trump's companies would not invest in \"foreign jurisdictions,\" but there was no indication foreign actors couldn't invest in Trump projects in the United States. Trump also set forth a legal fight over the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which experts have warned prevents the president from receiving revenue from foreign governments through his companies. His lawyers argue this does not apply to \"fair value exchanges,\" like a stay at one of his hotels at normal rates, and added that he would turn \"profits\" from such stays over to the Treasury Department. But ethics lawyers argue that Trump can't accept any payments at all from foreign governments, not just those above \"fair value.\" There's a good chance this dispute will spark legal challenges. Finally, Trump offered no explanation as to how the public would be able to judge for themselves whether he or his business is affected by conflicts. He has yet to release his taxes -- and reiterated at the press conference he had no plans do so -- and has put out only limited information on his business operations and debts. What is Trump's stance towards Russia? Trump's transition has been roiled by ongoing fallout from what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a major hacking campaign ordered by Vladimir Putin to help boost his candidacy against Hillary Clinton. When it came to hacking, Trump's answers were confusing and it was difficult to tell how he will handle relations with Russia going forward. On the one hand, he said for the first time that he accepted the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was behind hacks, but he added later \"it could have been others.\" He said Putin \"shouldn't be doing it\" and even suggested he might support sanctions levied by President Obama in response. But Trump also declined to condemn Putin and added \"If Putin likes Trump, I consider that an asset.\" Nor did he sound upset about a Russia cyberattack on American democratic institutions: Echoing his old campaign rallies, he urged the press to \"look at what was learned from that hacking\" of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

Authorities urged thousands of residents in Northern California to evacuate as pounding rain threatened to overflow rivers. About 2,000 people in Wilton, a rural community near Sacramento, were asked to leave their homes Tuesday night, according to The Associated Press . Meanwhile, some 3,000 residents in Sonoma County were under an evacuation advisory as the Russian River crested Monday at 35 feet, flooding several low-lying neighborhoods, according to ABC's San Francisco station KGO . Eric Risberg/AP Photo A man stops to take a picture of the Russian River as it floods Johnson's Beach, Jan. 10, 2017, in Guerneville, California. ABC News meteorologists say the Russian River will continue to rise Wednesday and will approach 39.8 feet in the evening at Guerneville, the largest town along the river. ABC News meteorologists are monitoring other rivers for flooding. The Napa River was causing moderate inundation Wednesday morning but is expected to begin receding in the afternoon. Rain sent the Navarro River significantly over the flood stage Wednesday morning, but it will recede by the afternoon, ABC News meteorologists said. Multiple school districts in Northern California were closed Wednesday because of the weather, according to ABC affiliate KXTV . Dozens of states, from California to New Jersey, were under winter weather alerts as of Wednesday morning. Eric Risberg/AP Photo A duck makes its way as Russian River floods, Jan. 10, 2017, in Monte Rio, California. In the past seven days, Central California has received over 2 feet of rain, causing rivers to overflow and flood roads, cities and many of the Golden State\u2019s famed vineyards, according to ABC News meteorologists While rain drenches the state\u2019s lower-lying areas, snow is blasting elevated regions. The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the eastern Sierra Nevada reported 15 feet of new snow in six days. \u201cThe resort is approaching their all-time snowiest January on record,\u201d ABC News senior meteorologist Max Golembo said. ABC News California will continue to see additional rainfall through Friday. A small tornado touched down near Sacramento early Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service. The twister ripped limbs off trees and awnings from buildings, but no injuries were reported. \u201cThis is the time of the year when California would see them \u2014 in the winter,\u201d Golembo said of tornadoes, adding that the twister was at the bottom of the tornado scale, an EF-0. ABC News A satellite image shows the current status of the storm over California and a new storm moving in, Jan. 11, 2017. The storm is forecast to move out of Central California on Wednesday and bring snow to the Rocky Mountains and rain to the Los Angeles area in Southern California, which is entering its sixth year of severe drought . Meanwhile, a new weather system is moving in from the west and will dump even more rain beginning late Wednesday into early Thursday. The storm will approach Northern California by Wednesday night before moving into Central California. ABC News meteorologists predict the new system will produce locally over 2 inches of rain in California through Friday. 0 Shares ",

Some loyal fans think so, citing lackluster \"improvements,\" a lack of innovation, and a year that saw sales fall for the first time since 2001. As Apple celebrates the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, the company appears to have gone into \"maintenance mode\" while everyone waits for its next big thing to emerge \u2014 if ever. Ronan Timoney, a 23-year-old economics and finance student in Ireland, has had Apple laptops since 2010, iPhones since 2011 and an iPad since 2012. As a young, avid Apple user, he's exactly the kind of customer the company should be wooing for their long-term success. But his most recent smartphone purchase was an Android.

He \"will not be buying any Apple products for the foreseeable future,\" he said. 2016 was a particularly rotten year for Apple. Annual sales fell for the first time since it launched the iPod in 2001, going from a record $234 billion in 2015 to $216 billion. Its new lineup of MacBook Pros this year failed to impress. The best thing about the iPhone 7 is its camera. It also forced users to invest in $159 wireless AirPods, which had a delayed launch , or use an awkward dongle to use their old headphones. Not very \"Appley.\" Core Products for 2017 And what's in store for 2017? Reportedly three new faster iPad models in different sizes as the company tries to fend off other touch-screen phones and computers, but iPad units have declined in 10 of the last 11 quarters. Instead of \"thinking different\" the company is \"thinking slightly better.\" To be sure, \"Apple is a great American success story,\" but, \"a lot of that innovation came from the Steve Jobs era,\" said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners known for his bearish views on the company. CEO Tim Cook is an efficient caretaker but doesn't necessarily have the late Steve Jobs' \"founder's fire\" that can propel a company past the threshold of what was thought to be possible, said Gillis. \"Amazon, Google, Tesla, Netflix, Facebook, what do they have in common? They're all still driven by their founders. They're still able to make big bets and change directions. Is Apple positioned for the next thing?\" asked Gillis. Related: Apple's Poor Performance Takes a Bite out of Tim Cook's Salary That's the big question as longtime users and investors wait to see where the company's $2 billion annual increase in research and development has been going and on what acronym it might it plant a flag next. AR? IOT? VR? AI? \"What you're seeing is a point where Apple is making a slower transition away from being a company that historically came out with whizzbang products every couple of years to a company that makes great products we all need,\" said Gene Munster, the co-founder of Loup Ventures, who previously covered Apple as a Piper Jaffray analyst for over a decade and remains bullish. \"As they shift resources, you get what happened in 2016: Not that exciting of a product year.\" Who's Driving Innovation? He thinks the next big things for Apple will be whatever it decides to do in the car space, artificial intelligence, and, according to the kind of Apple rumors that used to capture fanboys' and pundits' imaginations, a foldable phone with bendable glass. But it won't be Apple making the device, countered Gillis. \"They're not driving the innovation... Samsung will be the ones who make it.\" Even hardcore Apple users say they've noticed a change. Apple is becoming more like Microsoft, a former wunderkind that became large, profitable, boring, and angered pro users. Is Microsoft the New Apple? As a Mac user, I.T. manager Dan Fox is used to standing out at his PC-filled office at an Orlando-based engineering firm. \"Apple made these gorgeous, sleek, shiny devices that looked like they were from the future,\" he told NBC News. \"They were cooler than anything else on the market and, more importantly, they actually worked better,\" said the 45-year-old Fox. His family members are all Apple fans too, and their house is full of MacBooks, Apple Watches, iPads, iPhones, Apple TVs, and he even sprang for the AirPods. As of late though, the \"cutting edge\" upgrades to the Surface and Office 365 have him considering that Microsoft might be becoming the new Apple, with well-built and innovative products, he says, that show an attention to details. He still loves Apple, but says he feels \"Improvements are iterative, and it's almost as though Apple is now relying on its brand more than its tech. It feels like they are stalling on innovation to squeeze one more model out with a tiny upgrade. Rinse. Repeat. Thing are starting to feel\u2026 stale.\" Ben Popken ",

Got it (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) By Greg Miller , Ellen Nakashima and Karen DeYoung January 11 at 7:09 PM Follow @gregpmiller Follow @nakashimae Follow @karendeyoung1 As the nation\u2019s top spies prepared to brief President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump on Russian interference in the 2016 election, they faced an excruciatingly delicate question: Should they mention the salacious allegations that had been circulating in Washington for months that Moscow had compromising information on the incoming president? Ultimately, they concluded they had no choice. A 35-page dossier packed with details of supposed compromising personal information, alleged financial entanglements and political intrigue was already in such wide circulation in Washington that every major news organization seemed to have a copy. \u201cYou\u2019d be derelict if you didn\u2019t\u201d mention the dossier, a U.S. official said. To ignore the file, produced by a private-sector security firm, would only make the supposed guardians of the nation\u2019s secrets seem uninformed, officials said, adding that many were convinced that it was only a matter of time before someone decided to publish the material. Their decision appears to have hastened that outcome, triggering coverage of politically charged allegations that news organizations had tried to run down for months but could find no basis for publishing until they were summarized and included alongside a highly classified report assembled by the nation\u2019s intelligence services. [ Intelligence chiefs briefed Trump on unconfirmed claims Russia has compromising information on president-elect ] President-elect Donald Trump argues with a reporter during a news conference in Trump Tower on Wednesday. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters) U.S. officials said Wednesday that the decision had been unanimous to attach the two-page summary of the dossier to a sweeping report on Russian election interference commissioned by the White House and briefed to Obama, Trump and congressional leaders. The U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about sensitive discussions, said the nature of the summary \u201cwas fully explained\u201d to Trump and \u201cput into context,\u201d to make clear that it was not produced by the government and was unverified. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Chief James B. Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers all concurred that both Obama and Trump should know that U.S. spy agencies were aware of the claims about compromising information on Trump and had investigated or explored them to some degree. U.S. officials emphasized that the summary was merely an annex to the main report, that the allegations it contained have never been substantiated and did not appear in the main body of the report or influence its conclusions that Russia sought to sabotage the 2016 race and help elect Trump. But linking a collection of unsubstantiated allegations to a classified report that is supposed to convey the intelligence community\u2019s firmest conclusions about Russian election interference has blurred the distinction between corroborated intelligence and innuendo. Former U.S. intelligence officials described the inclusion of the summary \u2014 drawn from \u201copposition research\u201d done by a political research firm \u2014 as highly unusual. \u201cIt would be extraordinary if not unprecedented to bring to the attention of a president and \u00adpresident-elect a private document for which you had no reason to believe the allegations made in it,\u201d said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA and a Clinton supporter. (Sarah Parnass,Glenn Kessler/The Washington Post) Spokesmen for the CIA, FBI and the director of national intelligence declined to comment. [ Read the declassified intelligence community report on Russian activities in the 2016 election ] The handling of the matter also seemed to deepen the level of distrust between Trump and the intelligence community, whose work he has repeatedly disparaged since his election victory two months ago. In a news conference in New York , Trump blasted U.S. intelligence agencies and accused them of employing Nazi-like tactics to discredit him. \u201cI think it was disgraceful, disgraceful, that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake, out,\u201d Trump said, referring to a burst of headlines over the past two days about the dossier. \u201cThat\u2019s something that Nazi Germany would do and did do.\u201d The material in the dossier was assembled by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, whose security and investigations firm was hired to assist a political research firm in Washington that was initially working for Trump\u2019s opponents in the Republican primaries but later offered its services to Democrats, according to individuals familiar with the matter. Steele\u2019s role was first reported Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal. Since 2009, he and another former British intelligence officer have jointly operated a Britain-based firm called Orbis Business Intelligence. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday. The dossier was provided to multiple news outlets, including The Washington Post, which pursued numerous leads, including overseas, but could not substantiate its allegations. The document was also at some point delivered to the FBI. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) acknowledged in a public statement Wednesday that late last year he had \u201creceived sensitive information that has since been made public\u201d and, unable to assess its accuracy, delivered the file to Comey. Other officials said that the FBI had obtained the dossier even before McCain\u2019s involvement and that U.S. officials had met with Steele, the former British spy, at least twice \u2014 once in August and again in mid-October, after Clapper had released a public statement accusing Russia of interfering in the election. Those meetings were part of a broader effort by the FBI and other agencies to evaluate the claims about Russia and compromising material on Trump. The dossier also included claims of ongoing, unexplained contacts between members of Trump\u2019s inner circle and allies of the Kremlin. The status of that inquiry is unclear. In Senate testimony Tuesday, Comey said that \u201cwe never confirm or deny a pending investigation.\u201d The line drew a reaction of disbelief from some lawmakers who have been sharply critical of Comey\u2019s decision during the election to discuss the bureau\u2019s probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email use. \u201cThe irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid,\u201d said Sen. Angus King (I-Maine). Although Comey was one of only four senior officials involved in the decision to include the two-page summary, some in Washington were quick to see that move as another political misstep by the FBI chief \u2014 calling arguably unnecessary attention to allegations against a major political figure. U.S. officials have offered conflicting accounts of what the meetings with Steele accomplished. A senior official said Tuesday that while the allegations in the two-page summary could not be corroborated, it was included in part because the sourcing was seen as reliable. Others disputed that and said that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate Steele\u2019s claims without getting detailed information about his sources in Russia, information he is seen as unlikely to be willing to share. A former senior U.S. intelligence official also questioned his ability to maneuver in Russia and gain access to high-level officials with ties to the Kremlin or Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. \u201cHow did this former British intelligence officer talk to all these Russian officials and not get arrested for espionage?\u201d the former official asked.

By Dan Lamothe January 11 at 3:12 PM Follow @danlamothe Retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, the president-elect\u2019s nominee for defense secretary, during a meeting on Capitol Hill. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) The House Armed Services Committee has canceled a hearing Thursday in which retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis was to address the unconventional nature of his nomination for defense secretary, two congressional staff members said, because President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team decided against him appearing. Mattis was to testify in the afternoon on his need for Congress to pass legislation that would exempt him from a law that prevents recently retired military officers from serving in senior civilian jobs in the Pentagon. The legislation states that retired military personnel must be out of uniform for seven years. The original law, adopted in 1947, had a 10-year moratorium and was created to ensure that civilians control the military. Two committee staff members, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Mattis was willing to appear before the House committee. Separately, Mattis\u2019s confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday morning before the Senate Armed Services Committee. [ Experts back Mattis as defense secretary but say a general should not run the Pentagon again for years ] \u201cThis is a major issue affecting civilian control of the military, and Congress has a responsibility to consider it carefully with hearings and a markup,\u201d said Rep. Adam Smith (D.-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the committee. \u201cThe members of our committee have not been afforded a chance to hear from General Mattis, including new members who have just joined Congress and need information to make up their minds.\u201d A spokeswoman for the transition team, Alleigh Marr\u00e9, said in a statement that Mattis\u2019s focus is on \u201cfollowing the Constitutional process for confirmation\u201d and testifying before the Senate committee. \u201cIf confirmed, he looks forward to working with both the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, which play critical roles in supporting our forces and ensuring civilian control of the military,\u201d Marr\u00e9 said. Congress has granted only one exception to the law. Army Gen. George C. Marshall, an active-duty five-star general, was defense secretary for about a year beginning in 1950 after he was selected by President Harry S. Truman as the military struggled in the early days of the Korean War. Legislation passed at the time allowed Marshall to take the job but said it was \u201cthe sense\u201d of lawmakers that \u201cno additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved.\u201d Retired U.S. Marine Corps General James Mattis has been chosen to be secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) The law means that in addition to requiring confirmation by the Senate, both chambers of Congress must pass a waiver for Mattis. Senate Republicans included a clause in the continuing-resolution spending bill passed last month that limits debate about Mattis\u2019s waiver to 10 hours, making it hard for Democrats to block the nomination. Barron Youngsmith, a spokesman for House Armed Services Committee Democrats, said they have several concerns when comparing the legislation that allowed Marshall to hold the position and the proposal that would open the door for Mattis to become Pentagon chief. For one, the legislation for Mattis does not name him specifically, providing the waiver only to \u201cthe first person appointed\u201d as defense secretary. If for someone reason Mattis is not approved, the new law would still be on the books, Youngsmith said. Marshall\u2019s waiver specifically named him. Mattis, as a military retiree drawing a pension, also is still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the set of laws that guide behavior in the military. Among the laws are provisions that forbid contempt toward officials and disregard for orders or regulations. Democrats believe Mattis explicitly should be exempt from military law if his going to be defense secretary, Youngsmith said. A provision in the legislation for Marshall stated he was subject to \u201cno supervision, control, restriction, or prohibition (military or otherwise)\u201d than he would be if he were not an officer. Smith does not appear to agree with some of those concerns. Interviewed Monday night, he said he was not concerned about Mattis\u2019s name not appearing in the legislation. Smith added that having \u201csomeone of Mattis\u2019s capability and character\u201d is needed now more than ever \u201cto help hopefully stop any of the crazy stuff\u201d that other members of Trump\u2019s administration, particularly national security adviser Michael Flynn, might propose. At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday, two national security experts testified that Mattis has the acumen to be defense secretary but argued that they do not think there should be another general after him serving in the position for at least 20 years. One of the witnesses, Eliot Cohen of Johns Hopkins University\u2019s strategic-studies program, argued that Mattis would be a \u201cstabilizing and moderating force, preventing wildly stupid, dangerous or illegal things from happening\u201d in Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cAs has long been pointed out, the secretary of defense is other than the presidency probably the most difficult job in the federal government, and I would trust General Mattis as much as or more than just about anybody else,\u201d Cohen said.

USA TODAY NETWORK President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 11, 2017. It was his first press conference in nearly six months. (Photo: Justin Lane, EPA) President-elect Donald Trump brought his campaign against what he considers fake news to his first major press conference since\u00a0winning the election. What played out could suggest\u00a0contentious times ahead\u00a0for mainstream media outlets while covering the incoming administration. At one point, the president-elect shouted down CNN reporter Jim Acosta, labeling the cable news network as \"fake news\" for its report that U.S. intelligence agencies had briefed the incoming president and President Obama with allegations that Russian operatives claim to have potentially compromising personal and financial information about Trump. Getting\u00a0worse criticism was BuzzFeed, which published the 35-page classified document\u00a0on its site as part of its coverage. Trump described the classified report as \"false and fake and never happened\" and called BuzzFeed a \"failing pile of garbage. Writing it, I think they are going to suffer the consequences.\" Intel chiefs briefed Trump, Obama on unverified, salacious allegations concerning Russia and president-elect In getting publicly called out by Trump, Acosta and CNN \"was somewhat suffering for the sins of BuzzFeed in this case,\" said Kyle Pope, editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review . The faceoff, in what was Trump's first press conference in more than five months, portends things to come. \"The bigger picture here is that this is going to be a deeply combative relationship between this president and the press,\" Pope said. \" Ed Wasserman, dean of the graduate school of journalism at\u00a0the University of California-Berkeley,\u00a0found the televised event \"fairly demoralizing and disappointing,\" he said. \"I had hoped for a more substantive and spirited exchange where he would actually submit to questioning by answering the questions.\" Instead, Trump's engagements with the press will be \"kind of a\u00a0ritualized interaction in which Trump reiterates his contempt for the press and the press once again re-earns its reputation for being hypercritical and adversarial.\" New Facebook project aims to strengthen ties with media When the stories broke Tuesday night, Trump took to Twitter calling the\u00a0reports\u00a0\"fake news\" and a \"witch hunt.\" He followed that up Wednesday morning with another tweet: \"Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\" During the press conference, the president-elect complimented many news outlets about their handling of the report, including The New York Times, which did not reference or link to BuzzFeed in its initial story. \"I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that, but I will tell you there were some news organizations \u2026 that were so professional, so incredibly professional, that I\u2019ve just gone up a notch on what I think of you,\" he said. Regardless, coverage of the classified briefing is real news, not fake news, and Trump should have expected this story to come out\u00a0between the briefing and the earlier circulation of the classified document, said Nsenga Burton, digital editor for Grady Newsource and an instructor at the University of Georgia's Cox Media Institute for Journalism, Innovation & Management. \u00a0\"CNN could not not have a story about that briefing that was circulating and call itself a news organization,\" she said. About BuzzFeed's publication of the document, \"we can argue if that is news or journalism. At least they provided some context and said they were in the process of vetting it. ... But that is news. Not (what is in) the document, but the fact the document exists.\" As a business person, Trump should know that it would be more helpful to have \"a working relationship\" with outlets such as CNN, she said. \"You can't call someone from CNN a liar and think that is going to end well for your administration,\" Burton said. Trump and the Russia report: What you need to know Pope wondered whether other reporters should have come to Acosta's aid and asked a question for him or ceded their time to CNN. \"The challenge for the press is the media basically has to come to grips with the fact they have a president who is going to do absolutely nothing to help them and is going to put as many roadblocks in front of them as he possibly can and also is going to do all he can to discredit them and undercut any trust they have between them and their readers.\" Some came to CNN's defense later in the day. During his afternoon broadcast Fox News\u2019 Shep Smith said, \u201cCNN\u2019s exclusive reporting on the Russian matter was separate and distinctly different from the document dump executed by an online news property. Though we at Fox News cannot confirm CNN\u2019s report, it is our observation that its correspondents follow journalistic standards and that neither they nor any other journalists should be subjected to belittling or delegitimizing by the President-elect of the United States.\u201d National Press Club President Thomas Burr called it\u00a0\"dangerous and unhealthy to\u00a0declare a news item as 'fake news' to distract from facts that you may not like or don't favor your perspective,\" in a statement issued about the president-elect's press conference. \"Our incoming president must treat the news media as the vital cornerstone of our democracy that it is,\" he said. \"To label something as 'fake' in an effort to undermine news outlets endangers the trust granted journalists by the public and is antithetical to our country's values.\" The @PressClubDC raises concerns about Trump's use of \"fake news\" phrase to discredit news he doesn't like https://t.co/UNEnF5QU7A \u2014 Thomas Burr (@thomaswburr) January 11, 2017 In another oddity from the press conference, Trump was asked about his Wednesday morning tweet questioning \"Are we living in Nazi Germany?\" His response was that it was a \"disgrace\" that the intelligence agencies leaked it. \"That's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do,\" Trump said. \"I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.\" Ironically, that tweet came very close to\u00a0invoking an iconic Internet meme known as Godwin\u2019s Law. First coined in 1990 by attorney and author Mike Godwin, it says \u201cAs an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches 1.\u201d The theory is that once someone in a discussion begins comparing anything to Hitler, the discussion is over and whoever had invoked the Nazi comparison has lost the debate.

On Tuesday, Pavel was on his way to a pest control appointment when he came across a motorist standing in the roadway. \u201cI was approaching a red light and I saw the man standing at the back of his car,\u201d Pavel told me. \u201cI thought maybe he was trying to flag someone down.\u201d It was clear the man was in distress. It turns out he was choking to death. Pavel jumped out of his vehicle and rushed to the man\u2019s side \u2013 while the dash cam video in the company van recorded the entire incident. Click here to preorder Todd\u2019s NEW book \u2013 The Deplorables\u2019 Guide to Making America Great Again! He tried patting the man on the back \u2013 hoping that would dislodge whatever was in the guy\u2019s throat \u2013 but it did not work. And performing the Heimlich maneuver proved to be a bit difficult because the victim was a bit larger than Pavel. In addition to being a fighter, Pavel appeared on two seasons of the hit television show \"America Ninja Warrior.\" So, he knows a thing or two about improvisation. And that\u2019s how he came up with the idea to employ a maneuver he normally uses on fighters during cage matches. \u201cI got a Gable Grip on the guy and just picked him up off the ground,\u201d Pavel said. The improvised emergency maneuver did the trick and the blockage was cleared in a matter of just a few seconds. \u201cHe thanked me but it all happened so fast I didn\u2019t even get his name,\u201d he said. Back at the pest control company, Pavel\u2019s co-workers were shocked by the video. They called him a hero \u2013 but that\u2019s not how Pavel sees things. \u201cI just helped somebody out. I took 30 seconds out of my day to help somebody,\u201d he said. Caleb Fabry, the president of Town and Country Pest Solution, sent me a copy of the video on Facebook. \u201cThis guy showed us in this video that nothing matters but life and love,\u201d Mr. Fabry said. \u201cI think that is one of the most touching parts of this whole video.\u201d And that brings me back to the company\u2019s ethos. \u201cYes, we kill bugs and remove animals from people\u2019s homes, but more importantly, we do what we do because we love helping others, plain and simple,\u201d Mr. Fabry said. \u201cWe believe that our business is successful and in the good place that we are in only because of our God. We give Him all the glory.\u201d I believe there is a lesson for us to learn from this modern-day parable that unfolded on a street corner in Rochester. The gentleman who nearly choked to death told Paul something that shook me to my core. \u201cHe said he was trying to get people to help him, but they kept driving around him. He was choking and nobody cared,\u201d Pavel said. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him,\u201d the Gospel of Luke records. Pavel Fesyuk is that Good Samaritan. He offered a helping hand to a stranger in need. He had mercy on him. Now, go \u2013 and do likewise.

President-elect Donald Trump holds his first news conference since July 27, 2016, on Jan. 11, 2017, in New York City. Scott ClementThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump 's media event announcing plans to shift his assets into a trust managed by his sons, but not to give up ownership of the Trump Organization, marks the greatest detail Trump has provided on how he would try to avoid conflicts between his business interests and service as president. While the coming weeks will tell whether Trump's announcement shifts public views of his business conflicts, polls beforehand showed a majority was concerned about potential conflicts of interest, and clear majorities say he should disclose more information about his business dealings. Two surveys released Tuesday offer a fresh look at Americans' view of Trump's potential conflicts. A Pew Research Center poll found 57 percent of adults are very or somewhat concerned that Trump's \"relationships with organizations, businesses or foreign governments conflict with his ability to serve the country's best interests.\" One-third said they are \"very concerned\" about the issue. Separately, a Quinnipiac University poll found a similar 60 percent of registered voters were very or somewhat concerned that \"Trump would veto a law that would be good for the country because it would hurt his business interests.\" Some 4 in 10 were \"very concerned\" about this possibility. These two polls found differing results on whether concern is on the rise (Quinnipiac) or falling (Pew), but their overall level of concern is quite similar despite asking different questions. While Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say they are at least somewhat concerned about Trump's conflicts influencing his decisions (89 percent vs. 27 percent), a 63 percent majority of self-identified independents said they are concerned Trump would veto that would damage his business interests. The Quinnipiac poll also found 52 percent of voters think Trump has more potential for conflicts than most politicians; only 10 percent said he has fewer conflicts, while 35 percent said he has about the same amount.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 Though the motivation for the news conference was to outline how he will deal with his complex web of business interests once he\u2019s in the White House, much of the press conference ended up focusing on Russian election interference and on reports Tuesday that the intelligence community\u2019s classified report on Russian hacking had an addendum with unverified details of potentially compromising information that Russia has gathered on the president-elect, and that Mr. Trump was briefed on last week. Here are some of the highlights: Russian hacking, and reports of Russia holding \u201ccompromising information\u201d on him Mr. Trump said he\u2019s not allowed to discuss information that was presented during his intelligence briefing -- but confirmed that outside the briefing, he did in fact see the memo in question on compromising information, calling it a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump slams reports that Russia has potentially compromising information about him. \u201cI saw the information, I read the information outside of that meeting. It\u2019s all fake news -- it\u2019s phony stuff, it didn\u2019t happen and it was gotten by opponents of ours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a group of opponents who got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap together.\u201d Asked whether he accepts the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia actively worked to influence the 2016 election, Mr. Trump said he believes Russia was responsible for the hacking -- but stopped short of saying he believed they had an influence on the campaign. \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russian,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people and I can say that when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that, that was something that was extraordinary.\u201d Asked if he had a message for Putin about future hacking activities, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing it, he won\u2019t be doing it.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump talks about his potential relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cRussia will have much greater respect for our country when I\u2019m leading it than when other people have led it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see that.\u201d He said he considers Putin\u2019s praise of him to be \u201can asset, not a liability,\u201d though he doesn\u2019t yet know whether he and Putin will \u201cget along.\u201d \u201cNow I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to get along with Vladimir Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I do, but \u2026 do you honestly believe that Hillary [Clinton] will be tougher on Putin than me?\u201d Separation from business empire Though Mr. Trump asserted that he would have been able to continue running his business from the White House if he wanted to, he said his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr., along with Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, would take over his businesses while he\u2019s president.\u00a0 Donald Trump's attorney explains how the president-elect is turning over his business to a trust run by his sons, but he won't divest. Watch Trum... \u201cI could actually run my business ... and run government at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that looks but I\u2019d be able to if I wanted to.\u201d The stacks of manila folders on the table next to Mr. Trump at the podium were, he said, \u201csome of the many documents I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control.\u201d \u00a0 Mr. Trump introduced Sherri Dillon of Morgan Lewis, a lawyer who has been working on the plan for the Trump business empire. Dillon said Mr. Trump\u2019s business holdings and investments will be put in a trust before Inauguration Day to be overseen by sons Donald Jr. and Eric, and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. Mr. Trump also said that his two adult sons will run the company. Ivanka Trump, whose husband Jared Kushner is set to become a senior adviser to the Trump White House, will have \u201cno further management\u201d role in the company. There will be \u201cno new foreign deals\u201d made during the duration of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, Dillon added, and domestic deals will be subject to \u201csevere restrictions.\u201d To people who suggest Mr. Trump should sell his business, Dillon said that would only \u201cexacerbate\u201d the possibility for conflicts. Additionally, in order to ensure that \u201cit is the American people who will profit\u201d going forward, Mr. Trump has directed that all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels will be donated to the U.S. Treasury.\u201d Media criticism At the start of the press conference, Mr. Trump thanked news organizations that did not run stories on Russia\u2019s alleged compromising information about him.

(Jan 11) AP Rex Tillerson, former ExxonMobil CEO and Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of State, testifies at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 11, 2017. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON \u2014 Former ExxonMobil CEO\u00a0Rex Tillerson pledged Wednesday to restore \u00a0American leadership in the world and to defeat the Islamic State as a priority in the Middle East\u00a0during his Senate confirmation hearing to be Donald Trump's secretary of State. \u00a0 \"American leadership must not only be renewed, it must be asserted,\" Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"Competing priorities must be addressed, but they must not distract us from our first priority, which is defeating (the Islamic State).\" The primary action against the Islamic State would be \u201cto remove its caliphate\" in Syria and Iraq, which will hurt the group's credibility but not\u00a0remove it as threat, Tillerson said. Tillerson also said the U.S. \"must be clear-eyed about our relationship with Russia.\" \"Russia today poses a danger. It invaded Ukraine including Crimea and violated the laws of war. But it\u2019s an absence of American leadership that left this door open,\" he said. Tillerson admitted that Russia and the United States are unlikely to be\u00a0friends. \"We do not have the same values. But there is scope to define a different relationship to bring down the temperature of the conflict we have today,\" he said. \"Dialogue is critical so these things do not spin out of control.\u201d Posted!

Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the committee, pointed out that Tillerson blamed a failure of U.S. leadership for\u00a0Russia\u2019s recent aggressive actions into other countries. \u201cWe are the only global superpower with the means and the moral compass capable of shaping the world for good,\u201d Tillerson said. When Cardin asked about Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea, Tillerson said \u201cthat was a taking of territory that was not theirs,\u201d adding that it \"caught a lot of people by surprise. ...\u00a0The real question is about the response.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asked Tillerson if he considers Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal, mentioning Russia's actions in Syria and Russia's war against an uprising in Chechnya province. \u201cThose are very very serious charges to make, and I would want more information before making that conclusion,\u201d Tillerson said. Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., asked if Tillerson would agree such actions were criminal if U.S. intelligence agencies provided information confirming they did happen.\u00a0\u201cYes sir,\u201d Tillerson said. Corker earlier told Tillerson his\u00a0nomination makes sense for a president-elect who looks at the world with the eyes of a businessman, having been head of one of the world's largest corporations with operations in dozens of countries. \"You may in fact be an inspired choice,\" Corker said.\u00a0\"You are the person in charge to provide advice to the president-elect on foreign policy,\" he added. \"What the people here today are going to want to know is how are you going to advise.\" Senators also asked about climate change, especially considering his role at the helm of ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest petroleum producers. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., asked Tillerson to confirm media reports that\u00a0ExxonMobil concluded as early as the 1970s that petroleum-based emissions\u00a0were damaging climate, yet decided to fund and promote views contrary to its awareness of the science. Tillerson replied, \"Since I\u2019m no longer at ExxonMobil I can no longer speak on its behalf.\" Kaine then asked,\u00a0\"Do you lack knowledge or refuse to share your knowledge?\" \"A little of both,\" Tillerson said. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked Trump about ExxonMobil's business in Iran, Syria and Sudan through a joint venture in the early 2000s, when those countries were under U.S. sanctions as sponsors of terrorism. As USA TODAY reported this week, ExxonMobil said the transactions were legal because they were conducted by a European-based company\u00a0and involved no U.S. personnel. ExxonMobil and Iran did business under secretary of State nominee Tillerson \u201cWas there any country you would not do business with?\u201d Murphy asked. \u201cThe standard was \u2018was it legal?\u2019\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cDo they honor contract sanctity, do they have rule of law, are there mitigating actions that can be taken to prevent adverse actions that might be taken.\u201d ",

(Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports) Tim Tebow did not get an invitation to the New York Mets' major league spring training camp, despite his manager's wishes. Instead, he will report to the Mets' minor-league camp in Port St. Lucie, Fla. to continue\u00a0his\u00a0pursuit of a major league career. Tebow was omitted from the list of major league camp invitees announced by the Mets on Wednesday. At last month's winter meetings, manager Terry Collins expressed his desire about having Tebow at spring training. MLB announces 2017 Spring Training schedule \u201cI will tell you if he\u2019s not in our camp, I\u2019ll get him over,\" Collins said. \"I think he\u2019s a name in Florida. He\u2019s a star in Florida. He should be. I think it would be fun to have Tim come over. And certainly one thing about our players, they\u2019re athletes, too. They\u2019re fans, too. They would probably like to know how to run a quarterback sneak one day.\u201d It remains possible that Tebow play in Grapefruit League games, as teams commonly utilize players from minor league camp, particularly early in the spring season. The Mets' Grapefruit opener is Feb. 24 against the Boston Red Sox in Fort Myers. Collins visited Arizona and watched Tebow play in the Fall League,\u00a0but admitted he did not\u00a0meet with Tebow. Tebow, the former Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, had his moments in the Fall League, but struggled against some of baseball's best young pitchers. In his\u00a019-game stint, he\u00a0batted .194 with 20 strikeouts in 62 at-bats. Pitchers and catchers are expected to report on Feb.\u00a014 with the first full workout scheduled for Feb.\u00a019.

By Ed O'Keefe and Anne Gearan January 11 at 1:12 PM Follow @edatpost Follow @agearan Secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson called U.S. intelligence findings of Russian interference in the presidential election \u201ctroubling\u201d Wednesday but said he has not yet seen classified information about allegations that Russia intended to help President-elect Donald Trump. Tillerson, the former top executive at ExxonMobil, also declined to strongly denounce Russian military actions in Syria that have led to civilian deaths or to broadly condemn alleged human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. He conceded that climate change is man-made and needs to be addressed by world powers \u2014 but also that there\u2019s very little he can do to control the potential global fallout of Trump\u2019s tweeting. Tillerson\u2019s hearing was the marquee event on a busy day amid a consequential week for the incoming Trump administration as the president-elect\u2019s top Cabinet picks begin the confirmation process. As Tillerson testified, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, was sitting for his second day of hearings with the Judiciary Committee and Elaine L. Chao, Trump\u2019s choice for transportation secretary, testified before the Senate commerce panel. Lawmakers were also keeping tabs on Trump\u2019s long-anticipated news conference in New York, his first since winning the presidency, where he conceded that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election. Tillerson\u2019s sometimes testy confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee gave the 64-year-old Texan his first chance to address concerns that ExxonMobil put profits ahead of human rights, environmental and policy concerns, and to explain his relationship with Russia. What lies ahead for Trump's nominees, and how Democrats helped smooth the way View Graphic What lies ahead for Trump's nominees, and how Democrats helped smooth the way \u201cI understand full well the responsibilities and the seriousness\u201d of the job, Tillerson said. \u201cI don\u2019t view this as a game in any way,\u201d he said, rejecting a characterization that he might view problems and policies as transactional. Sharp inquiries by senators in both parties signaled that Democrats and Republicans are still skeptical about whether Tillerson is suited to be the chief U.S. diplomat alongside a president with no government experience, particularly at a time of increasingly strained relations between the United States and Russia. With his smooth baritone voice, he assured senators that he would set aside a profit-driven worldview born of 41 years as an oil executive, and would recuse himself from decisions involving his former employer, the world\u2019s largest oil company. Tillerson retired Dec. 31 and has pledged to sell his remaining ExxonMobil stock. But Tillerson seemed constrained and at times reluctant in answering questions about some of the most controversial positions adopted by Trump during the presidential campaign. In some cases he said he does not yet have sufficient information to comment in detail, as with the Russian presidential hacking allegations clouding Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency now, and in other cases he said the incoming administration has not yet settled on its views. \u201cIn my conversations with him on the subjects we have discussed, he\u2019s been very open and inviting of my views and respectful of those views,\u201d Tillerson said of Trump. \u201cMy sense is that were going to have all the views presented on the table.\u201d Tillerson called himself a pragmatist about Russia, which he said is not a friend of the United States but can be a partner. Moscow has been emboldened in Ukraine and elsewhere by a void in strong U.S. leadership, Tillerson said, and he pledged a tough stance with both Russia and China over territorial ambitions. \u201cWe have stumbled,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent decades, we have cast American leadership into doubt.\u201d Here are the people Trump has chosen for his Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people Trump has chosen for his Cabinet He was most critical of foreign policy decisions made by President Obama, but also found fault with the Iraq War launched by Republican President George W. Bush. He declined to label Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin a war criminal or to condemn Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte over human rights abuses the leader himself claims he committed. He seemed to stun some senators by saying he had not yet discussed Russian action in Aleppo, Syria, with Trump. He frustrated others by appearing to stonewall questions about ExxonMobil lobbying against economic sanctions, especially concerning Russia, where the company does extensive business. Tillerson said he never lobbied on the issue and fumbled over whether ExxonMobil ever had. At one point he said that to the best of his memory, ExxonMobil had not done that. Democrats on the committee produced lobbying records that show ExxonMobil had said it was lobbying over various economic sanctions measures, including tough sanctions on Iran in 2010 and more recently over sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea. Under questioning by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, Tillerson did not dispute intelligence officials\u2019 findings on Russia, saying that he had reviewed the unclassified report that U.S. agencies released last week on Russian interference in the election. More detailed classified versions of that report were presented to Trump and to President Obama. \u201cThat report clearly is troubling and indicates that all of the actions you just described were undertaken,\u201d Tillerson said. Rubio is the only Republican on the committee who has suggested he might oppose Tillerson \u2014 a move that could imperil the former executive\u2019s nomination. Any GOP resistance could endanger the nomination in the Senate, which Republicans hold with 52 seats. As the hearing concluded, Rubio signaled he has not made up his mind. \u201cI have to make sure I\u2019m 100 percent behind whatever decision that I make, because when I make it, it isn\u2019t going to change,\u201d he told reporters. It is not clear that any Democrats on the committee will vote for Tillerson. But some Democrats were wondering, given how much Tillerson differed with some of Trump\u2019s past statements, whether Tillerson is the best nominee that Democrats can expect from the president-elect, according to one Senate Democrat closely following the hearings. Rubio has become a proxy for other GOP senators voicing similar concerns about Tillerson\u2019s views on Putin and Russia. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who do not sit on the panel, have indicated reluctance to vote for Tillerson, as have others. McCain said Tuesday that he had no plans to attend the proceedings but that he intended to send Tillerson written questions regarding Russia \u201cand other matters.\u201d Concerns with Tillerson\u2019s ties to Russia include that he accepted an Order of Friendship award given personally by Putin in 2013 and because he has met with the Russian leader and other senior government officials numerous times. [ What is the Russian Order of Friendship, and why does Rex Tillerson have one? ] Tillerson appeared to break with Trump over the whether Russia was justified in annexing the Crimea region of Ukraine, the value of an international climate agreement and the wisdom of expanding the number of countries that possess nuclear weapons, among other issues. He also appeared to depart from the president he would serve in support for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and rejection of any \u201cblanket\u201d ban on Muslim immigration or registry. Tillerson hedged on his views on the human role in climate change and the extent of the threat it poses, although he did say he thinks the United States is better served by remaining a party to the international agreement on climate change brokered under the Obama administration. Trump has vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d U.S. participation in the accord, in which hundreds of countries collectively agreed to slash carbon emissions to help mitigate the effects of global warming. Under clipped questioning about Trump\u2019s business dealings and Exxon\u2019s views on climate science from Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who was the Democratic nominee for vice president in the 2016 election, Tillerson repeatedly answered \u201cI have no knowledge.\u201d Kaine asked whether the response came from a lack of knowledge or a refusal to answer, Tillerson said with a smile, \u201ca little of both.\u201d Tillerson flashed his blunt style again when asked by Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) how he might urge Trump to check his prolific tweeting to preserve foreign relations. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be telling the boss how he ought to communicate with the American people. That\u2019s going to be his choice,\u201d Tillerson said, adding that he expects to be in sync with Trump on world affairs. If there\u2019s any disagreement, \u201cI have his cellphone number,\u201d Tillerson added. \u201cAnd he\u2019s promised me he\u2019ll answer \u2014 and he does.\u201d Karoun Demirjian, Karen DeYoung and Steven Mufson contributed to this report. world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy \u25a0 What exactly prompted American intelligence officials to pass on a summary of the unvetted claims to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and Congress. Officials have said they felt the president-elect should be aware of the memos, which had circulated widely in Washington. But putting the summary in a report that went to multiple people in Congress and the executive branch made it very likely that it would be leaked. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What will happen now? The F.B.I. has been investigating the claims in the memos, and Democrats are demanding a thorough inquiry into the reports that Trump representatives met with Russian officials during the campaign. But as of Jan. 20, Mr. Trump will be in charge of the bureau and the other intelligence agencies, and he may not approve such an investigation. Why can\u2019t I read the memos on your website? Because the 35 pages of memos prepared as opposition research on Mr. Trump contain detailed claims that neither the intelligence agencies nor The Times has been able to verify, Times editors decided to briefly summarize the claims and not publish the document. Why did The Times report extensively on the hacking of the Democratic Party, but not this? The Times did report before the election that the F.B.I. was investigating claims about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia \u2014 an article that resulted from an extensive reporting effort. The Democratic National Committee and Podesta emails were public, their authenticity was not in doubt, and they contained newsworthy information. Why did the F.B.I. director write two letters about Clinton\u2019s emails, but not this? That is a question the director, James B. Comey, may eventually have to answer. His two public statements about the bureau\u2019s investigation of the Clinton emails broke with long F.B.I. tradition . Why did the news media not raise this during the campaign? Many reporters from multiple news organizations tried to verify the claims in the memos but were unsuccessful. So what changed on Tuesday? Why is this now being reported? CNN broke the news that a summary of the memos had been attached to the classified report by the F.B.I., C.I.A. and National Security Agency on the Russian hacking and leaking, and that it had been given to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders last week. That level of official attention prompted news organizations to decide to inform the public about the memos.

Tillerson was awarded Russia's\u00a0Order of Friendship in 2013\u00a0and has been the subject of scrutiny for his relationship with Vladimir Putin. Jan. 11, 2017. During his Senate confirmation hearing, nominee for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson answers questions from Marco Rubio about whether Vladimir\u00a0Putin is a war criminal, to which the former Exxon Mobil CEO declined to comment. Tillerson was awarded Russia's\u00a0Order of Friendship in 2013\u00a0and has been the subject of scrutiny for his relationship with Vladimir Putin. Jan. 11, 2017. Tribune news services Contact Reporter Barraged by questions about Russia, Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state promised a far more muscular approach toward the Kremlin on Wednesday, abandoning much of the president-elect's emphasis on improving ties between the Cold War foes. Instead, Rex Tillerson suggested the outgoing Obama administration responded too softly to Moscow's takeover of Ukrainian territory. The surprising shift in tone by Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil CEO and Russian \"Order of Friendship\" recipient, reflected the difficulty Trump will have in persuading Democrats and Republicans to broach a broad rapprochement with President Vladimir Putin's government. Calling Russia a \"danger\" to the United States, Tillerson said he would keep U.S. sanctions in place and consider new penalties related to Russian meddling in the presidential election. Although he said he hadn't read last week's classified assessment by the U.S. intelligence community, Tillerson said it was a \"fair assumption\" that Putin would have ordered the operation that purportedly included hacking, propaganda and internet trolls to harm Hillary Clinton's candidacy and advance Trump's. But in a puzzling revelation, Tillerson conceded he hadn't yet talked with Trump about a Russia policy. \"Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests,\" Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He added that Trump's administration would be committed to the defense of America's NATO partners, an obligation the president-elect called into question during the campaign if allies failed to meet defense spending pledges. Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. While his prepared statement reflected some of Trump's desire for improved ties, Tillerson quickly pivoted under pressure from both sides of the aisle. On Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimea region, he said, \"That was a taking of territory that was not theirs.\" Still, he criticized President Barack Obama's sanctions on Russia, which ended up costing Exxon hundreds of millions of dollars. And he declared that he would have responded by urging Ukraine to send all available military units to its eastern border with Russia and recommending U.S. and allied support through defensive weapons and air surveillance, to send a message to Moscow. \"That is the type of response that Russia expects,\" he said in a response to questions from Sen. Marco Rubio, Tillerson's toughest GOP inquisitor, who later lectured the oil man on human rights and hinted he might withhold his support. \"If Russia acts with force,\" Tillerson said, \"they require a proportional show of force.\" Trump offered a sharply different account of Ukraine during the presidential campaign and never proposed a show of U.S. military force in Ukraine. In an August interview, he claimed Russia would not enter Ukraine, not seeming to know Russian troops were already there. He suggested Crimea didn't count because the peninsula's people preferred being part of Russia, restating Putin's reason for taking the territory in 2014. Like Trump, Tillerson vowed complete support for Israel, which he called America's \"most important ally\" in the Middle East. Caption Sen.

If he is confirmed by the Senate, Coats would face a daunting task as the bridge between Trump and the intelligence community. He said the new administration would undertake a full review of the Iran nuclear deal to deny the Islamic republic the ability to acquire an atomic weapon. He said that might only be possible if Iran can no longer enrich uranium, which the accord permits under strict constraints and without which Tehran wouldn't have made the deal. Some of the questioning reflected the traditional friction between a Congress that wants to prescribe foreign policy and an executive branch that traditionally seeks to maintain broad flexibility in its international affairs, tinted by Tillerson's vocal opposition to economic sanctions as a business leader. Addressing some of Congress' most experienced architects of U.S. economic pressure, Tillerson called sanctions \"a powerful tool\" in deterrence that could, however, also project weakness if applied poorly. He said neither he nor Exxon had lobbied against sanctions. But the company did try to influence sanctions legislation on Russia two years ago, congressional records and data from the Center for Responsive Politics show, and Tillerson made numerous White House visits, to no avail. Given a second chance on the subject, Tillerson sought to clarify his answer by saying he had expressed concerns related to security in shutting down an Exxon operation newly prohibited under the sanctions. President-elect Donald Trump 's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson , goes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, 2017. Tillerson represents a break in a longstanding tradition of secretaries of state with extensive military, legislative, political or diplomatic experience. Yet his supporters point to Tillerson's lengthy career as a senior executive in a mammoth multinational company as proof he has the management and negotiating skills to succeed in the State Department's top post, particularly when facing tough foreign governments. \"It's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying,\" Trump said of Tillerson during a news conference in New York that occurred as Tillerson was testifying. \"He ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it.\" His Exxon experience, however, has been criticized by Democrats for possible conflicts of interest because of the company's far-flung business dealings. Tillerson, who stepped down as CEO at the end of 2016, said he understood being secretary of state meant different responsibilities. He pledged to be a steward for U.S. national interests rather than corporate ones. \"He is not prepared to be our secretary of state,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. If all 10 Democrats on the committee vote against Tillerson, and Rubio or any other Republican joins them, the nomination would then be referred to the full Senate with \"no recommendation.\" That would be an embarrassment for such a high-profile Cabinet nominee and could signal a larger confirmation battle. \"He's got to convince me he sees Russia for who they are,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, another skeptical Republican. On Tillerson's proposed response to the election hacking charges, Graham said, \"Real fuzzy answer.\" Associated Press ",

Donald Trump's attorney explains how the president-elect is turning over his business to a trust run by his sons, but he won't divest. Watch Trum... Instead, Trump will move his assets into a trust controlled by his two oldest sons, who will also manage the Trump Organization. They will not pursue new international deals, and will hire an ethics adviser to oversee new deals in the U.S. They will also not consult with Trump on business matters. \u201cI hope at the end of eight years I\u2019ll come back and say, \u2018oh, you did a good job.\u2019 Otherwise, if they do a bad job I\u2019ll say \u2018you\u2019re fired,\u2019\u201d Trump said. On Wednesday, Walter Shaub, the head of the government ethics office, called the plan \u201cwholly inadequate.\u201d Walter Shaub CBS News \u201cThe plan the [president-elect] has announced doesn\u2019t meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting, and that every president in the past four decades has met,\u201d Shaub said. The arrangement means Trump could have dealings as president with foreign countries where he also has a financial stake. CBS News has counted at least 10 countries , including Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, where the president-elect has business interests . \u201cHe needs to sell the businesses, free himself of conflicts of interests,\u201d said Richard Painter, the ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush. Painter said Trump could violate a constitutional provision that forbids a government official from receiving payments from foreign governments. For example, a state-run Chinese bank is a tenant in Trump Tower New York. ",

    "text": "Chao Says Private Investors Can Help Boost Transportation By joan lowy, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 11, 2017, 4:34 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Elaine Chao: Everything You Need to Know 0 Shares Email The incoming Trump administration is looking to \"unleash the potential\" of private investors to boost the national transportation networks that underpin the U.S. economy, the president-elect's pick for transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, told lawmakers Wednesday. Economic gains are being \"jeopardized\" by aging infrastructure, rising highway fatalities, growing congestion and a failure to keep pace with emerging technologies, Chao testified before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Chao, 63, is expected to be easily confirmed by the Senate. She was labor secretary during George W. Bush's administration and deputy transportation secretary under President George H.W. Bush. Her husband is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. When McConnell introduced Chao at the hearing, he stole a line from former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole: \"I regret I have but one wife to give for my country's infrastructure.\" Dole's wife, Elizabeth, is a former transportation and labor secretary. Chao joked, \"I will be working to lock in the majority leader's support tonight over dinner.\" But she hasn't been immune from criticism. Unions say that as labor secretary, she mostly sided with industry when enforcing labor and safety rules. Chao advocated using \"innovative financing tools\" that can \"take full advantage of the estimated trillions in capital that equity firms, pension funds and endowments can invest.\" She said private investment should be encouraged with \"a bold, new vision.\" She didn't detail those incentives, but a paper written by two economic advisers to President-elect Donald Trump recommends providing $137 billion in tax credits to infrastructure investors. His advisers predict that will generate about $1 trillion in investment over 10 years. But transportation experts note that investors are interested only in transportation projects that produce revenue, such as toll roads, and there are relatively few large projects like that. They say states need financial aid from the federal government to help with a growing backlog of maintenance and repair projects for aging highways, bridges and transit systems. Providing tax incentives also runs the risk of providing a windfall to investors for projects that would have been built anyway. Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J., asked Chao if she and the incoming Trump administration would support infrastructure legislation that includes direct federal spending on transportation in addition to efforts that generate private financing. \"I believe the answer is yes,\" she said. That could put the new administration at odds with conservatives who insist that federal spending be restrained. Sen. Mike Lee , R-Utah, urged Chao to consider greatly reducing the federal gas tax that pays for most highway and transit spending, and leaving nearly the entire responsibility for transportation to states. \"I am open to all ideas,\" she replied. Trump repeatedly promised during the campaign to spend $1 trillion on roads, bridges, railways, airports and other types of infrastructure. It's one of the main ways he said he would create jobs. But he has said little about this since the election. Republican congressional leaders have said they'll wait to see what Trump proposes before tackling a public works bill. Trump has said he expects to be occupied early in his administration with cutting taxes and repealing President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. Infrastructure isn't expected to be dealt with until late spring. Democrats at the hearing tried to pin Chao down on contentious issues such as whether to privatize air traffic control operations and whether she would enforce a deadline for railroads to install train control systems that can prevent many derailments and collisions. Chao said those decisions would be up to the Trump White House or that she hadn't been briefed on the issues yet. As transportation secretary, Chao would be responsible for regulating auto, truck, train, transit, pipelines and aviation safety. The department frequently faces pressure from industry to relax safety rules and block new ones. Chao, who has been associated with conservative think tanks, is likely to lend a sympathetic ear to industry pleas for less regulation. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP\u2014Joan\u2014Lowy.

Power has criticized his country for its repeated vetoes of U.N. resolutions on the Syrian conflict. After reports of unverified intelligence on President-elect Donald Trump and Russia surfaced Tuesday night, Power provided some context. \u00a0 Kellyanne Conway pushes back on \u201cfake\u201d Trump intel claims \u201cWhat I can say is what I see every day at the U.N., which is that the rules that need to bind countries so that we live in a more stable world don\u2019t bind Russia. And they flout them,\u201d Power said Wednesday on \u201c CBS This Morning .\u201d \u201cThey flout them by invading their neighbors, they flout them by committing horrible atrocities in Syria and they have flouted them by interfering in our election.\u201d In retaliation for the country trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election, the U.S. has\u00a0 imposed sanctions on Russia . Intel report says Putin ordered \"influence campaign\" on U.S. election \u201cWhat [Putin] might say, if he were here, is that those sanctions are an account of why he\u2019s doing this or that. Although nothing he says is credible, just as his denials with regard to our election are not credible,\u201d Power said. \u201cBut the cause and effect goes in the other direction. Our sanctions came as a result of his decision to lop off part of a neighbor . They come in as a result of support for a regime that has used chemical weapons against its people , etc.\u201d Power said Putin doesn\u2019t seem to stand for a \u201cnew world order.\u201d For example, if a country wants to go to war, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to play by a certain set of rules,\u201d Power said.\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t systemically target civilians, you don\u2019t use chemical weapons, you don\u2019t use barrel bombs. All of those norms are being subjected to challenge by President Putin and others. And it is incumbent on those of us, again, who have helped build that international order, you might have to make some adjustments,\u201d Power said. \u201cObviously, the world is more multi-polar than it was in 1945, but it\u2019s in our interest for there to be rules.\u201d Power, who has also forcefully denounced atrocities committed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, stressed the importance of the United States\u2019 role in international affairs. U.N. ambassador on why Assad regime in Syria must end \u201cLook at Ebola , look at dismantling Iran\u2019s nuclear program, look at mobilizing the stiffest sanctions in two decades on North Korea in response to their nuclear proliferation. On issue after issue, we lead. And in the event we were not to lead, you would not see global responses,\u201d Power said. \u201cI live it every day on the Security Council. The issue is briefed and then everybody looks to me and says, \u2018Ok, what\u2019s the United States going to do about it?\u2019 And then it\u2019s incumbent on us to leverage what we do to get other countries to step up.\u201d ",

The vote does not repeal President Obama's signature achievement, but it does set the stage for Republicans to clear the first procedural hurdle for repeal of the massive health care law. The bill will now go to the House of Representatives for a vote expected to take place on Friday. \"The Senate just took an important step toward repealing and replacing Obamacare by passing the resolution that provides the legislative tools necessary to actually repeal this failed law while we move ahead with smarter health care policies,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. Democrats who opposed repealing Obamacare staged a protest during the vote, breaking with procedural rules by attempting to orally dedicate their votes to people they say would be harmed by repealing Obamacare. VIDEO: Here is how the Democrats' vote-a-rama rules protest of repeal effort unfolded on Senate floor after 1am pic.twitter.com/r34Gyempeo \u2014 Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO) January 12, 2017 The action came at the end of Wednesday's late night of consecutive votes as part of the body's annual \u2014 or sometimes biannual \u2014 vote-a-rama. It's the first step of a two-part process to fulfill Donald Trump's campaign promise (and Congressional Republicans' longstanding vow) to dismantle the health care law. The all-nighter was powered by pizza deliveries to the Senate floor. Indiana Republican Rep. Todd Young handed out goodie baskets filled with popcorn and Mountain Dew to reporters in the Senate Press Gallery to kick off the night. Senate staffers arrive with pizzas during an after hours series of votes on amendments to the budget bill. EPA The vote followed a timeline laid out by President-elect Trump for the repeal and replacement of the health care law, also known as Obamacare, in his first news conference in nearly six months earlier Wednesday. Outgoing Lt. Governor Brad Owen, center, waits to lead the Senate through the Capitol to the House chambers for a joint session of the Legislature. Elaine Thompson / AP He said that his administration would release a plan to repeal and replace the health care law \"almost simultaneously.\" He is hanging the timeline on the confirmation of Rep. Tom Price, his nominee for secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. \"The easiest thing would be to let [Obamacare] implode in 2017, and believe me, we'd get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it'd take a long time. We are going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary is approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan,\" Trump said. \"It will be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day, could be the same hour.\" \"Very complicated stuff,\" he added. Price, the current head of the House Budget Committee, has worked on health care repeal in the past. He wrote the repeal bill in 2015 that passed the House and the Senate but was vetoed by President Obama. A House Republican leadership aide said that they are working closely with Price on health care as he prepares to transition to the administration. The aide also insisted that there's no daylight between Congressional Republicans on the expedited timeline to repeal and replace ACA. Vice President-elect Mike Pence gave more details when asked about ACA repeal between meetings with senators on Capitol Hill Wednesday. \"We're working with legislative leaders at this very moment to begin to craft legislation that will repeal the most corrosive elements of Obamacare \u2014 the individual mandate, the taxes, the penalties \u2014 but at the same time, moving separate legislation that will allow us to introduce the kind of reforms in American health care that'll lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government,\" Pence said. The House aide cautioned, however, that a replacement won't be a comprehensive bill and will be done in parts. Play ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Jan 11, 2017 11:12 PM EST The mechanism Congress will use to undo Obamacare is the arcane budget process known as \u201creconciliation.\u201d This enables Senate Republicans, who hold a slim majority of 52 - 48, to get around the requirement for a supermajority of 60 votes to pass the repeal. Under reconciliation, they just need a simple majority. But it still won\u2019t be easy.\u00a0 Some Obamacare enrollees hope to see it repealed Senate approval -expected early Thursday - and then House passage as early as Friday would trigger committee action to write repeal legislation that could come to a vote next month. A full replacement would follow sometime after that, presuming Republicans can come up with one.\u00a0 \u201cWe must act quickly to bring relief to the American people,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \u00a0 On Wednesday, starting at around 6:30 p.m. ET, Senate Republicans will take the first step by passing the budget blueprint for the current 2017 fiscal year, along with the reconciliation bill, both of which will just require a simple majority. However, both measures are also subject to unlimited amendments, which are invariably stacked until the end and result in an hours-long series of votes that typically stretch until after midnight. This is called \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d It\u2019s not the repeal itself -- it just sets the repeal process in motion. And it also won\u2019t carry the force of law -- it\u2019s just a blueprint for Congress, and the president will not be signing it. Usually budget resolutions make projections about spending and taxes. The current measure is a \u201cshell\u201d bill that projects almost $10 trillion in new debt over a decade, but enabling action on repeal. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a strong fiscal conservative, has railed against fellow Republicans about adding to the debt. Amendments will be posted by the Senate Budget Committee here .\u00a0 The ensuing repeal legislation - a budget \u201creconciliation\u201d bill in Washington-speak - would be written by a handful of House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over health issues. It\u2019ll first go to the House, where debate should be fairly routine. When the Senate takes up its version, however, Democrats will have many opportunities to offer amendments. The House and Senate would have to work out their differences before passing a final version and sending it to the White House for Trump\u2019s signature. ",

Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Police investigate the scene of a quadruple homicide in Chicago on Dec. 17. Scott Olson/Getty Images A Pew survey of police officers across the U.S. found that most officers believe their jobs have grown more difficult and more dangerous following a series of high-profile deaths of black citizens during encounters with police. The survey also uncovered sharp disparities between the perceptions of black and white officers \u2014 and between officers and the general public \u2014 over the state of race relations in America. Pew calls the survey \"one of the largest ever conducted with a nationally representative sample of police.\" The survey addressed a range of topics, but a number of questions examined what Pew described as \"high-profile fatal encounters between black citizens and police officers,\" and how police perceived the impact. Concerns Over Safety, Effectiveness Some of the most striking results: 86 percent of police officers say such incidents have made their job harder, and 93 percent said they have made them more concerned about safety. NPR's Martin Kaste, who covers law enforcement, says that 93 percent stat jumps out \"in this post-Ferguson era.\" He also highlighted another statistic in the Pew survey: 72 percent of respondents say after recent high-profile incidents, they have become less willing to stop and question people who seem suspicious. Some people \u2014 including attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions \u2014 have suggested that public criticism of police has led to a drop in police morale and to a spike in crime in certain cities. The Pew survey is indicative of one way morale and crime rate might be linked, Martin says . Here's more of Martin's reporting on the issue: \"Eugene O'Donnell, former NYPD [officer and] former prosecutor, now on the faculty of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice ... says it's clear to him that the broad criticisms of the last couple of years has made cops less eager to do their jobs in places like Chicago. \"They have no clear mandate, they have no clear mission, they believe they're not going to be supported, and the major thing you hear from Chicago cops is stay fetal \u2014 go fetal, stay fetal,\" [O'Donnell said]. \"With Donald Trump about to become president, that's become the ascendant narrative in American policing: that cops are going fetal because of unfair criticism, which leads to higher crime. Chicago has become this argument's case in point, but that's not entirely fair, says Lori Lightfoot. She's been at the forefront of the reform efforts there. \" 'I mean, in Chicago, yes arrests are down, yes investigatory stops are down, but at the same time, they're taking 8,000 illegal guns off the street every year,' [Lightfoot said]. 'You don't do that if you're sitting back and not doing your job.' \" Martin Kaste on 'Morning Edition': Reformers In An 'Uphill Battle' ",

By David Nakamura and Abby Phillip January 11 at 1:20 PM Follow @davidnakamura Follow @abbydphillip President-elect Donald Trump acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that he believes Russian operatives hacked the Democratic Party during the election, but he continued to dispute intelligence reports that Moscow acted to help him win. \u201cI think it was Russia,\u201d Trump said at a news conference in New York when asked who was responsible for the public leaks of Democratic emails during the campaign. But Trump emphasized that he believes Russia also would have released damaging information about him had they obtained such information. He angrily denounced news reports that U.S. officials had obtained an unsubstantiated dossier of potentially compromising personal information Russia has allegedly gathered about him, citing denials from the Kremlin that it has any such intelligence. U.S. officials reportedly included a two-page summary of the dossier in classified briefings of Russia\u2019s meddling in the election to President Obama and, separately, to Trump last week. Trump and his aides, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence, called the leaks of the information a smear campaign that aimed to damage Trump politically. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that that information would be let out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI saw the information; I read the information outside that meeting. It\u2019s all fake news \u2014 phony stuff. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Trump also addressed questions about his relationship with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, with whom he has expressed a desire to improve bilateral relations. \u201cIf Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what folks, that\u2019s an asset not a liability,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get along with Vladi\u00admir Putin . . . but even if I don\u2019t does anyone in this room think Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Putin than me? Give me a break.\u201d Trump made his remarks in his first news conference as president-elect, ending a period of 167 days since he has fielded questions from the full media contingent. Past winners of the presidency have traditionally faced the media much earlier. An estimated 250 journalists were crowded into the lobby of Trump Tower, where Trump aides had set up 10 American flags in front of a blue curtain. During the news conference, Trump announced that he has tapped David Shulkin, a physician who is serving in the Obama administration as Veterans Affairs undersecretary, to lead VA. And he detailed plans to shift his business assets into a trust managed by his sons and give up management of his private company, a step that will help the business executive move closer to resolving potential conflicts of interest. He also again resisted the idea that he should release his tax returns, saying \u201cthe only ones that care about my tax returns are the reporters\u201d and suggesting the public does not care about the issue. Earlier in the day, Trump had charged via Twitter that his \u201ccrooked opponents\u201d are trying to undermine his electoral victory. He accused the intelligence community of leaking the information to get in \u201cone last shot at me,\u201d saying, \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d 1 of 18 Photos from Trump\u2019s first news conference in six months View Photos President-elect Donald Trump holds the meeting in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. Caption President-elect Donald Trump took questions in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. Jan. 11, 2017 President-elect Donald Trump, accompanied by his family, arrives for the news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post [ Intelligence chiefs briefed Trump and Obama on unconfirmed claims Russia has compromising information on president-elect ] At the news conference, Pence and Sean Spicer, who has been tapped to be White House press secretary in Trump\u2019s administration, also denounced news organizations for their reports on the unsubstantiated dossier. Trump and his aides took particular aim at CNN, which broke the story that intelligence officials had included it in their briefings, and BuzzFeed News, which published a copy of the dossier in full. Trump refused to allow a CNN reporter to ask a question. \u201cYou are fake news,\u201d Trump said to the reporter, Jim Acosta, who had shouted out in an attempt to be called upon. The president-elect called BuzzFeed \u201ca failing pile of garbage.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace what took place, and I think they ought to apologize to start with,\u201d he said. U.S. officials said that intelligence agencies have not corroborated the allegations contained in the dossier but believed the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Earlier Wednesday, a spokesman for Putin called the allegations that Russia has collected compromising information about Trump an \u201cabsolute fantasy.\u201d Soon after, Trump tweeted: \u201cRussia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is \u2018A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.\u2019 Very unfair!\u201d Speaking Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Trump adviser Reince Priebus called the BuzzFeed report \u201cphony baloney garbage.\u201d He denied that Trump had engaged in compromising behavior in Russia and that Trump aide Michael Cohen had traveled to Prague to meet with Russian officials. Both allegations were contained in the document published by BuzzFeed. \u201cThere was no craziness in Russia. There was no meeting in Prague,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt is not an intelligence document. Cohen has never been in Prague. And all of this stuff isn\u2019t even fit to print in the New York Times.\u201d In an interview Tuesday night with NBC News, Obama said that he had not seen the reports and declined to comment on classified information. [ Two cities, two dramas and one day of tests for Donald Trump ] On immigration, Trump insisted he will build a wall \u2014 not a fence \u2014 along the southern U.S. border with Mexico, reiterating that Mexico will \u201creimburse\u201d the United States for the cost after it is initially funded by taxpayers. Republican leaders in Congress have been working with Pence and other Trump aides to develop legislation to start the process, which is projected to cost billions of dollars. \u201cMexico, through some form . . . will reimburse us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat will happen. Whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference\u201d if the payment is a reimbursement, Trump added. \u201cI want to get the wall started. I don\u2019t want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico.\u201d Wrapping up the news conference, Trump pointed to a work table piled with a massive stack of folders bursting with papers that was set up next to the lectern. The documents related to his business holdings, Trump said, and they represented some of the assets he would turn over to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric to oversee under the new arrangement in which he will not be involved in management decisions. \u201cI hope at the end of eight years I\u2019ll come back and say, \u2018Oh, you did a good job,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, before falling back on a catchphrase he made famous on his television show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he added, \u201cif they do a bad job, I\u2019ll say, \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019 \u201d Drew Harwell, Jena McGregor and John Wagner contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Jenie Chang told ABC News today that she had just pulled up to her parents' house in Fairfax, California, on Tuesday evening to pick up her two girls, ages 10 and 4, when she realized a \"massive fallen tree\" was blocking the way up to the house. \"It was surreal,\" Chang said. \"I had to use my high beams to make sure I was really seeing what I was seeing.\" West Virginia Landslide Swallows House, Forces Residents to Evacuate The massive tree had \"completely crushed the detached garage\" next to home, Chang said, adding that it -- along with other smaller trees and shrubs -- \"completely covered\" the 64 stairs leading up to home's main entrance. Chang said she immediately called her parents inside, who told her they were all safe but had been unaware of the mess just outside their door. Chang's parents then called for help, and within minutes, a unit from the Marin County Fire Department was on the scene, she said. KGO Firefighters rescued two young girls and their grandparents who were trapped in a house in Fairfax, California, on Jan. 10, 2017, after a landslide came to the front door. Firefighters used chainsaws to cut through several fallen trees, and they created a makeshift path up the muddy hill to the house's front door, according to Battalion Chief Bret McTigue, public information officer for the Marin County Fire Department. Firefighters then escorted the girls and their grandparents one by one down the path to safety, McTigue told ABC News today. He added that all four family members were OK and that no one suffered any injuries. KGO Firefighters rescued two young girls and their grandparents who were trapped in a house in Fairfax, California, on Jan. 10, 2017, after a landslide came to the front door. Chang said her two young girls were good-spirited about the whole ordeal and saw the experience as \"a great adventure.\" The full extent of the damage to Chang's parents' home is not yet known, McTigue said, adding that building inspectors were still working to assess the property this morning. 0 Shares ",

But several companies say they haven't been fully paid for that work. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Trump Organization spent $200 million to renovate the historic Old Post Office Building in Washington, D.C., transforming it into the Trump International Hotel. But several companies say they haven't been fully paid for that work. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images In late October, just weeks ahead of the election, President-elect Donald Trump made a quick detour to Washington for the official opening of his new five-star hotel, just a few blocks from the White House. During a ribbon-cutting ceremony , Trump told the crowd that the two-year, roughly $200 million renovation project at the historic Old Post Office Building was done ahead of schedule and under budget, thanks to what he called an incredible team of people \u2014 \"including hundreds of construction workers, electricians, maintenance workers and so many others who helped make this project a reality. They're really the important ones.\" Now some of those companies would like final payment for their work. Documents obtained by NPR show three Washington-area companies have filed liens against Trump International Hotel totaling more than $5 million. Agency Pushes Back On Claim Trump Would Breach Hotel Lease Once He Takes Office One company, Joseph J. Magnolia Inc., filed a $2.98 million mechanic's lien in December. According to the filing, the firm worked on the hotel from September 2014 to December 2016 and \"completed all plumbing, mechanical and HVAC work, along with site sewer, water, storm and water services.\" AES Electrical Inc., based in Laurel, Md., says it's owed $2.075 million for its work on the hotel for the same period of time as Magnolia. Sterling, Va.,-based A&D; Construction filed a lien in November saying it was owed $79,700. The firm's lawyer, Richard Sissman, says A&D; is a small, Hispanic-owned company that was subcontracting on the Trump hotel project. \"The nature of the work was ... trim and casework and architectural millwork, wall base, crown molding; this is all fine carpentry,\" he says. Article continues after sponsorship Sissman says A&D;'s lien is relatively small compared to the other two, but it's a lot of money to his client. \"On these big jobs these should be paid. It's ridiculous that a small-time operator has to beg for its money,\" he says. \"It's put him in a very bad situation right now.\" Donald Trump Ordered For Deposition In D.C. Hotel Restaurant Case Trump has faced many liens \u2014 and lawsuits \u2014 for alleged nonpayment for work in the past. Steven Schooner, a contracts specialist with the George Washington University law school, says resolving the liens in this case could ultimately involve the federal government because it holds the lease on the building where the Trump hotel is located. \"The way the lease is structured, it said they may step in and discharge the lien but they're not actually required to,\" he says. Still, Schooner says as a rule, the government wants its tenants \u2014 like Trump International Hotel \u2014 to solve its own problems. Requests for comment from Trump's communication team about the liens were not returned. ",

Try though they might, Republicans won't be able to erase President Barack Obama 's legacy expansion of health care when they take control of the White House along with both houses of Congress. Oh, sure, it's possible that GOP lawmakers and incoming President Donald Trump will follow through on... (Eric Zorn) Fourth, a tax return would reveal how aggressive Trump has been on his taxes. There is no black-and-white approach to taxes; there are many gray areas subject to interpretation, especially regarding deductions. Trump frequently suggests that he knows how to game the system, so voters would learn whether he takes the same approach to his taxes. Finally, the tax returns would disclose what percentage of Trump's income actually goes to taxes. - \"We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis -- hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody.\" A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trump's comment that there \"billions of dollars of losses\" in trade reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Chinese or Mexican goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would \"gain\" money that had been lost. - \"Some states have over a hundred percent [premium] increase.\" Trump exaggerates here, and appears to misunderstand a fundamental part of the Affordable Care Act. State-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. But the most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies. The vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about eight in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, \"anecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face.\" - \"I want to thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs.\" Trump keeps counting jobs that were never going to go to Mexico in the first place. Union officials say the number of jobs saved at Carrier shrank to 730, once the official paperwork was submitted. Meanwhile, 553 jobs, focused on making fan coils, will go to Mexico, as well as 700 jobs from a United Technologies Electronics Controls (UTEC) facility. Another 400 jobs in the two facilities, mostly administrative, were never going to leave. In effect, Trump saved 37 percent of the jobs slated to depart. But Greg Hayes, chief executive of United Technologies, told CNN that even more jobs at Carrier eventually would be lost through automation. - \"96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number -- that's the real number.\" This is an absurd claim, based on a real number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, relying on a monthly survey known as the Current Population Survey (CPS), shows that, as of December 2016, 95.1 million Americans 16 years and older were \"not in labor force.\" How is this number developed? Well, there is a civilian noninstitutional population of 253.9 million people, and 159.5 million are in the labor force. The difference yields the 95.1 million figure. But the unemployment rate is only 4.7 percent because just 7.5 million people actively are looking for a job and cannot find one. They are considered part of the overall labor force. In other words, you have to be seeking a job to be counted in the labor force. Who are the 95 million not in the labor force? The BLS has data for the year 2015. It turns out that 93 percent do not want a job at all. The picture that emerges from a study of the data shows that the 95 million consists mostly of people who are retired, students, stay-at-home parents or disabled. Trump is doing a real disservice by claiming 96 million really want a job that \"they can't get.\" - \"I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.\" We cannot resist noting that Trump was the leading purveyor of false \"birther\" claims questions, based on no evidence, that President Obama was not born in the United States. He frequently claimed that Obama had spent $2 million to cover this up - a number he plucked out of World Net Daily, which promotes conservative-leaning conspiracy theories. ",

President-elect Donald Trump amplified his already heated war with the intelligence community Wednesday, accusing agents\u00a0of disseminating an ugly and unsubstantiated report about him, and comparing the leak to Nazi\u00a0tactics. The showdown threatens to further undermine\u00a0trust between the next commander... (Noah Bierman and Brian Bennett) He called for a \u201cfull review\u201d of the international accord that seeks to block Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, but did not vow to rip it up as Trump has said. He said he does not agree with Trump\u2019s comments \u00a0in March that Japan and South Korea should build their own nuclear weapons to help counter North Korea. Trump has since suggested that he was misunderstood. Tillerson said he would oppose broadening ties further with Cuba because of its continued arrests of political opponents and other human rights abuses. But he did not pledge to shut Obama\u2019s diplomatic opening, as Trump has suggested. Unlike Trump\u2019s other picks for Cabinet positions, Tillerson repeatedly found himself under fire from fellow Republicans as he struggled, not always successfully, to allay concerns about his long-running ties to Russia. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) proved his toughest interrogator, demanding to know whether  Tillerson would label Putin a war criminal for what the U.S. government has said are Russian-backed attacks on civilian targets in Syria. Tillerson said he \u201cwould not use that term.\u201d Rubio cited civilian casualties and other atrocities in the Syrian city of Aleppo that he said were committed by Syrian government forces backed by Russia. \u201cThose are very, very serious charges to make and I would want to have more information,\u201d Tillerson said. Rubio seemed irked at the response, saying he found it \u201cdisturbing.\u201d Tillerson also said he did not have sufficient information to condemn Putin over accusations that the leader had\u00a0ordered the killings of political dissidents, journalists and others in Russia.\u00a0 \"None of this is classified,\" Rubio retorted. \"These people are dead.\u201d Tillerson was repeatedly pressed on his opposition, while running Exxon Mobil, to the economic sanctions that Washington and its allies imposed on Putin\u2019s government for its actions in Ukraine. Tillerson denied that he or Exxon had lobbied the government over sanctions, but senators presented several official documents that appeared to show extensive lobbying by the company. Comparing Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet Open link In his testimony, Tillerson said sanctions too often hurt U.S. companies that do business abroad. Exxon Mobil has said it lost $1 billion after sanctions on Russia effectively killed a planned oil and gas project.\u00a0 \u201cIn protecting American interests, sanctions are a powerful tool,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cLet\u2019s design them well, target them well, enforce them fully.\u201d He said he believed Trump agreed with him on this matter. He found support in the committee when he condemned Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula, and its support for antigovernment insurgents in eastern Ukraine, actions he stated were illegal. \u201cThe taking of Crimea caught a lot of people by surprise,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cThe absence of a firm, forceful response\u201d by the Obama administration was interpreted by Putin as permission to push farther into Ukraine and to launch other military operations abroad, he added. \u201cWhat Russian leadership would have understood was a more forceful response.\u201d Again departing from Trump, he said he would have provided the Ukraine government with defensive weapons and made a show of increased border surveillance and intelligence-sharing. If he is confirmed, Tillerson said he will sever ties to Exxon Mobil. But he would not commit to recusing himself on matters involving the energy industry beyond the first legally required year in office. He was interrupted several times by hecklers, who were quickly ushered out of the chamber by guards. \u201cDon\u2019t put Exxon in charge of the State Department!\u201d one woman shouted.

    "text": "How The Donald Trump Cabinet Stacks Up, In 3 Charts Former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson broke with President-elect Donald Trump on several areas of foreign policy involving Russia during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, saying in his opening statement that the country \"poses a danger\" to the global world. But as his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wore on, Tillerson admitted that he hasn't discussed U.S. policy toward Russia with Trump. Aggressively pressed by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on his past business relationships with Russia and Vladimir Putin, Tillerson wouldn't label the Russian president as a war criminal over the Russian military's alleged involvement in the Syrian civil war in targeting and killing civilians. \"Those are very, very serious charges to make and I'd want to have much more information before reaching that conclusion,\" Tillerson said. He also wouldn't say whether he believes the Kremlin is behind the killing of journalists and Putin critics, saying he would need to see more classified information to make a determination. Tillerson also sounded skeptical of the use of sanctions to punish Russia and other countries, saying that when they \"are imposed, they, by their design, are going to harm American businesses,\" but he did admit that they could be a \"powerful and important tool.\" He said that at Exxon he had never personally lobbied against sanctions and that the oil companies \"to my knowledge\" had never \"directly lobbied\" against sanctions. However, Politico reported last month that Exxon Mobil had in fact lobbied against a bill that would have made it harder for Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. But, overall, Tillerson still sounded a more hawkish tone against Russia than the incoming commander in chief he would serve. \"We aren't likely to ever be friends. ... Our value systems are starkly different,\" Tillerson said. Trump has repeatedly praised the country and said it needs to be friends with the U.S. \"We need to move Russia from being an adversary always to being a partner sometimes,\" Tillerson said. Article continues after sponsorship The idea that Tillerson was in a unique position to be an intermediary to the country and smooth over relations, while also projecting U.S. strength and ideals, was something that witnesses speaking in support of his confirmation told the committee in introductory remarks. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who served in both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, called Tillerson the \"right person at the right time\" to work on U.S.-Russia relations. Former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., an advocate of nuclear nonproliferation, said Tillerson's past business relationships with Russia and with Putin were \"assets, not liabilities.\" Tillerson also sounded a different tone from Trump on how he would have dealt with Russian aggression into Crimea. \"That was a taking of territory that was not theirs,\" Tillerson said, adding that he would have recommended that Ukraine use its military assets to line up along the eastern border and that the U.S. and NATO should have also helped with supplies and air surveillance. Russia would have understood and responded to such a \"powerful response,\" Tillerson said. Asked as to whether he believed U.S. intelligence reports that Russia was involved in cyberattacks intended to meddle in the U.S. elections, Tillerson said he had not seen the classified information but that the public report \"clearly is troubling.\" He said it was a \"fair assumption\" that Putin was directly involved. Tillerson cut ties with Exxon Mobil earlier this month to try to stave off conflicts of interest, but his history there is likely to play a large role in this week's hearings, and Democrats have been pushing for him to release tax records beyond the financial disclosure form he has already filed with the Senate committee. Watch the hearing live at the video player above. The hearing is ongoing and we will be updating this post throughout the day. Below is Tillerson's opening statement. Opening Statement of Secretary of State-Designate Rex Tillerson U.S. Senate Confirmation Hearing Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017, Washington, D.C. I am honored to have the backing of Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz from my home state of Texas. I also want to thank Senator Nunn for his commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, and Secretary Gates for his service to eight presidents and his own leadership as President of the Boy Scouts of America. Chairman Corker, Ranking Member Cardin, and Members of the Committee, it is an honor to appear before you today as President-elect Trump's nominee for Secretary of State and to seek the approval of this Committee and the full Senate for my confirmation. I would like to first introduce members of my family who are here today. These are the most important people in my life, and I want to express my gratitude to them for all their love and support over the years. First, my wife of over thirty years, Renda, who has always kept the homefires burning during my many trips abroad. My sister Jo Lynn Peters, a lifelong high school educator in Texas and Alabama. My younger sister Dr. Rae Ann Hamilton, a family practice physician in Abilene, Texas, and my brother in law Judge Lee Hamilton, a State District Judge in Abilene, Texas. I am grateful and proud they are with me today. I come before you at a pivotal time in both the history of our nation and our world. Nearly everywhere we look, people and nations are deeply unsettled. Old ideas and international norms which were well-understood and governed behaviors in the past may no longer be effective in our time. We face considerable threats in this evolving new environment. China has emerged as an economic power in global trade, and our interactions have been both friendly and adversarial. While Russia seeks respect and relevance on the global stage, its recent activities have disregarded American interests. Radical Islam is not a new ideology, but it is hateful, deadly, and an illegitimate expression of the Islamic faith. Adversaries like Iran and North Korea pose grave threats to the world because of their refusal to conform to international norms. As we confront these realities, how should America respond? My answer is simple. To achieve the stability that is foundational to peace and security in the 21st century, American leadership must not only be renewed, it must be asserted. We have many advantages on which to build. Our alliances are durable and our allies are looking for a return of our leadership. Our men and women in uniform are the world's finest fighting force, and we possess the world's largest economy. America is still the destination of choice for people the world over because of our track record of benevolence and hope for our fellow man. America has been indispensable in providing the stability to prevent another world war, increase global prosperity, and encourage the expansion of liberty. Our role in the world has also historically entailed a place of moral leadership. In the scope of international affairs, America's level of goodwill toward the world is unique, and we must continue to display a commitment to personal liberty, human dignity, and principled action in our foreign policy. Quite simply, we are the only global superpower with the means and the moral compass capable of shaping the world for good. If we do not lead, we risk plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger. But we've stumbled. In recent decades, we have cast American leadership into doubt. In some instances, we have withdrawn from the world. In others, we have intervened with good intentions but did not achieve the stability and global security we sought. Instead, we triggered a host of unintended consequences and created a void of uncertainty. Today, our friends still want to help us, but they don't know how. Meanwhile, our adversaries have been emboldened to take advantage of this absence of American leadership. In this campaign, President-elect Trump proposed a bold new commitment to advancing American interests in our foreign policy. I hope to explain what this approach means and how I would implement that policy if confirmed as Secretary of State. Americans welcome this rededication to American security, liberty, and prosperity. But new leadership is incomplete without accountability. If accountability does not start with ourselves, we cannot credibly extend it to our friends or our adversaries. We must hold ourselves accountable to upholding the promises we make to others. An America that can be trusted in good faith is essential to supporting our partners, achieving our goals, and assuring our security. We must hold our allies accountable to commitments they make. We cannot look the other way at allies who do not meet their obligations; this is an injustice not only to us, but to longstanding friends who honor their promises and bolster our own national security. And we must hold those who are not our friends accountable to the agreements they make. Our failure to do this over recent decades has diminished our standing and encouraged bad actors around the world to break their word. We cannot afford to ignore violations of international accords, as we have done with Iran. We cannot continue to accept empty promises like the ones China has made to pressure North Korea to reform, only to shy away from enforcement. Looking the other way when trust is broken only encourages more bad behavior. And it must end. We cannot be accountable if we are not truthful and honest in our dealings. Some of you are aware of my longstanding involvement with the Boy Scouts of America. One of our bedrock ideals is honesty. Indeed, the phrase \"on my honor\" begins the Boy Scout Oath, and it must undergird our foreign policy. In particular, we need to be honest about radical Islam. It is with good reason that our fellow citizens have a growing concern about radical Islam and murderous acts committed in its name against Americans and our friends. Radical Islam poses a grave risk to the stability of nations and the well-being of their citizens. Powerful digital media platforms now allow ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other terror groups to spread a poisonous ideology that runs completely counter to the values of the American people and all people around the world who value human life. These groups are often enabled and emboldened by nations, organizations, and individuals sympathetic to their cause. These actors must face consequences for aiding and abetting what can only be called evil. The most urgent step in thwarting radical Islam is defeating ISIS. The Middle East and its surrounding regions pose many challenges which require our attention, including Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. There are competing priorities in this region which must be and will be addressed, but they must not distract from our utmost mission of defeating ISIS. Because when everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. Defeating ISIS must be our foremost priority in the Middle East. Eliminating ISIS would be the first step in disrupting the capabilities of other groups and individuals committed to striking our Homeland and our allies. The demise of ISIS would also allow us to increase our attention on other agents of radical Islam like al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and certain elements within Iran. But defeat will not occur on the battlefield alone; we must win the war of ideas. If confirmed, I will ensure the State Department does its part in supporting Muslims around the world who reject radical Islam in all its forms. We should also acknowledge the realities about China. China's island-building in the South China Sea is an illegal taking of disputed areas without regard for international norms. China's economic and trade practices have not always followed its commitments to global agreements. It steals our intellectual property, and is aggressive and expansionist in the digital realm. It has not been a reliable partner in using its full influence to curb North Korea. China has proven a willingness to act with abandon in pursuit of its own goals, which at times has put it in conflict with America's interests. We have to deal with what we see, not with what we hope. But we need to see the positive dimensions in our relationship with China as well. The economic well-being of our two nations is deeply intertwined. China has been a valuable ally in curtailing elements of radical Islam. We should not let disagreements over other issues exclude areas for productive partnership. We must also be clear-eyed about our relationship with Russia. Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests. It has invaded Ukraine, including the taking of Crimea, and supported Syrian forces that brutally violate the laws of war. Our NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia. But it was in the absence of American leadership that this door was left open and unintended signals were sent. We backtracked on commitments we made to allies. We sent weak or mixed signals with \"red lines\" that turned into green lights. We did not recognize that Russia does not think like we do. Words alone do not sweep away an uneven and at times contentious history between our two nations. But we need an open and frank dialogue with Russia regarding its ambitions, so that we know how to chart our own course. Where cooperation with Russia based on common interests is possible, such as reducing the global threat of terrorism, we ought to explore these options. Where important differences remain, we should be steadfast in defending the interests of America and her allies. Russia must know that we will be accountable to our commitments and those of our allies, and that Russia must be held to account for its actions. Our approach to human rights begins by acknowledging that American leadership requires moral clarity. We do not face an \"either or\" choice on defending global human rights. Our values are our interests when it comes to human rights and humanitarian assistance. It is unreasonable to expect that every foreign policy endeavor will be driven by human rights considerations alone, especially when the security of the American people is at stake. But our leadership demands action specifically focused on improving the conditions of people the world over, utilizing both aid and economic sanctions as instruments of foreign policy when appropriate. And we must adhere to standards of accountability. Our recent engagement with the government of Cuba was not accompanied by any significant concessions on human rights. We have not held them accountable for their conduct. Their leaders received much, while their people received little. That serves neither the interest of Cubans or Americans. Abraham Lincoln declared that America is \"the last best hope of Earth.\" Our moral light must not go out if we are to remain an agent of freedom for mankind. Supporting human rights in our foreign policy is a key component of clarifying to a watching world what America stands for. In closing, let us also be proud about the ideals that define us and the liberties we have secured at great cost. The ingenuity, ideas, and culture of Americans who came before us made the United States the greatest nation in history. So have their sacrifices. We should never forget that we stand on the shoulders of those who have sacrificed much, and in some cases, everything. They include our fallen heroes in uniform, our Foreign Service Officers, and other government agents in the field who likewise gave all for their country. If confirmed, in my work for the President and the American people I will seek to engender trust with foreign leaders and governments, and put in place agreements that will serve the purposes and interests of American foreign policy. The Secretary of State works for the President and seeks to implement his foreign policy objectives. To do that I must work closely with my Cabinet colleagues and all relevant departments and agencies of the administration to build consensus. Let me also stress that keeping the President's trust means keeping the public trust. And keeping the public's trust means keeping faith with their elected representatives. I want all the members of this committee to know that, should I be confirmed, I will seek to be responsive to your concerns. I am an engineer by training. I seek to understand the facts, follow where they lead, and apply logic to our international affairs. We must see the world for what it is, have clear priorities, and understand that our power is considerable, but it is not infinite. We must, where possible, build pathways to new partnerships, and strengthen old bonds which have frayed. If confirmed, I intend to conduct a foreign policy consistent with these ideals. We will never apologize for who we are or what we hold dear. We will see the world for what it is, be honest with ourselves and the American people, follow facts where they lead us, and hold ourselves and others accountable. I thank you for your time and look forward to your questions. ",

The talk show host has come under fire for comments he made about Asian men during his \"Steve Harvey Show\" on Friday. A clip of the moment began gaining viral attention after it circulated online this week. During the show, Harvey shares a 2002 book cover with the title \"How to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide for Asian Men.\" \"Excuse me, do you like Asian men?\" he said. \"No, thank you.\" He said if there was a similar book titled \"How to Date a Black Woman: A Practical Guide [for] Asian Men,\" it would be \"one page too!\" \"'You like Asian men?' 'I don\u2019t even like Chinese food. It don\u2019t stay with you no time \u2026 I don\u2019t eat what I can\u2019t pronounce.\" As Harvey made the comments, he frequently paused to laugh at his own jokes. But plenty of people didn't see the humor in his bit. \"This was so not necessary and down right disrespectful,\" one commenter wrote on YouTube. Another added, \"Shame I'm Asian and I loved Steve Harvey but after seeing this video I can truly see what kind of person he really is\ufeff.\" Harvey has yet to comment on the backlash.

Jackson Township police say Ashley Zhao was found dead Tuesday at Ang\u2019s Asian Cuisine in North Canton after a daylong search. They didn\u2019t release details about how the child was concealed. MingMing Chen, left, and Liang Zhao, right WOIO Her parents initially reported that Zhao went missing after taking a nap at the back of the restaurant on Monday evening. They told police they believed she had wandered out the back door,\u00a0 reports CBS affiliate WOIO. But police now allege her mother struck Ashley in the face several times with her fist on Monday morning and the girl later died. Her mother, 29-year-old Mingming Chen, is charged with murder and felonious assault. Her father, 34-year-old Liang Zhao, is charged with complicity to murder and complicity to commit felonious assault. Chen and Zhao both appeared in Massillon Municipal Court Wednesday shackled and wearing orange jumpsuits. Neither showed emotion. A judge said the high bonds were set because they posed a flight risk. When a judge asked him how long he had lived in the U.S., Zhao answered, \u201c20-plus years.\u201d Information provided by the Stark County Sheriff\u2019s Office indicate that Ashley\u2019s father washed away green fluid coming from her mouth after the beating and unsuccessfully tried to revive her when she stopped breathing. Police officers and investigators from the state crime laboratory were seen at what is believed to be the family\u2019s apartment, The (Canton) Repository reported. Vickie Fothergill, who manages a store next to the restaurant, told the newspaper she had seen Ashley and an older sister at the restaurant many times. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Separately, Rohit Kachroo, security editor for NBC News British partner ITV News, reported that his name is Christopher David Steele, a former officer with MI6 who was posted to Moscow in 1990. The memo was originally generated on behalf of Republican opponents of Trumps but was later shopped to the media by Democrats.

A two-page summary of the 35-page memo was included in supporting material prepared for the officials who briefed President-elect Trump on Friday about a U.S. intelligence report on Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential elections, according to multiple officials. However, Trump was not orally briefed on the two-page \"annex\" outlining the allegations about him, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official with the knowledge of the preparation of the briefing. Trump said he learned the gist of the summary \"outside that meeting.\" The two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material was made available to the briefers to provide context for Trump should they want to draw a distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted \"disinformation,\" according to the official. The briefers also had available to them unvetted \"disinformation\" about the Clinton Foundation, though that was not briefed to Trump either. The existence of the two-page synopsis was first reported by CNN yesterday afternoon. Their decision to report on the synopsis, as well as the publication of the complete 35-page memo by BuzzFeed, was harshly criticized by Trump. (BuzzFeed is partially funded by the parent company of NBC News.) \"I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies let any information that turned out to be so false and fake to get out,\" Trump said a press conference in New York today. \"That's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.\" The memo, which suggested that Trump could be blackmailed by Russian intelligence, was circulated among Trump opponents over the summer and was eventually passed to the FBI. Today, Republican Senator John McCain admitted that he also passed the memorandum to the FBI. Hans Nichols ",

The clash was history making. Before Wednesday, no sitting senator had ever testified against a Senate colleague in their confirmation hearings for a Cabinet position. But the break of congressional norms is a marker of contentious confirmation battle ahead for many of President-elect Donald Trump's top picks to lead his new administration. \"I believe, like perhaps all of my colleagues in the Senate, that in the choice between standing with Senate norms and standing up for what my conscience tells me is best for my country, I will always choose conscience and country,\" Booker said.

    "text": "By Aaron Blake January 11 at 1:03 PM Follow @aaronblake For the first time since he was elected, President-elect Donald Trump held a news conference Jan. 11. Here are key revelations from his question-and-answer session with reporters in New York. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald J. Trump held a news conference Wednesday, his first since the November election. He was introduced by his incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, and vice president-elect Mike Pence. Here's the full transcript, along with our annotations. To see an annotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text. To make your own, sign up for a Genius account . SPICER: Morning. Thanks for being here (ph). (inaudible) days away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the United States. It's an opportunity to be here today to allow the president-elect to take your questions. After the president-elect makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D.C. with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will -- who structured the agreements pursuant to the president's business arrangements and she will give brief remarks. Before we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night. It's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office. According to BuzzFeed's own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report. The executive editor of the New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, \"Totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet.\" SPICER: The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks. The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple. One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign. These three individuals; Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, and Carter Page. Carter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign. Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time. We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague. In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague. A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at -- at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game. One report now suggested apparently it's another Michael Cohen. For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful. With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. (APPLAUSE) PENCE: We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I'm even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again. (APPLAUSE) Now, the president-elect's leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive. But as the Chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring. To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet. Nineteen of the 21 Cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a -- it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward. Perhaps that's why there's been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration. You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be. But with freedom comes responsibility. And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it. (APPLAUSE) But today, we'll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again. And we'll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today. So, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Thank you very much. It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a almost daily basis. I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it's good to be with you. TRUMP: We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but I do have to say that -- and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies? Who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that. A tremendous blot, because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released. But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years -- a couple in particular -- and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station. So, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room. I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that. But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional -- so incredibly professional, that I've just gone up a notch as to what I think of you. OK? All right. We've had some great news over the last couple of weeks. I've been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country. A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies -- big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest. You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant. I appreciate that from Ford. I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler. I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be. I think a lot of people will be following. I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back. We've got to get our drug industry back. Our drug industry has been disastrous. They're leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder. Pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs. We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time. And we're going to do that with a lot of other industries. I'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F-35, you've been reading about it. And it's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. I don't like that. And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. I've really gotten to know them well. And we're going to do some big things on the F-35 program, and perhaps the F-18 program. And we're going to get those costs way down and we're going to get the plane to be even better. And we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing. So, we've been very, very much involved, and other things. We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here. There are no -- they're going to do tremendous things -- tremendous things in this country. And they're very excited. And I will say, if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here. They would not be in my office. They would not be in anybody else's office. They'd be building and doing things in other countries. So, there's a great spirit going on right now. A spirit that many people have told me they've never seen before, ever. We're going to create jobs. I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that, I really -- I'm going to work very hard on that. We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we're going to do a real job. And I'm very proud of what we've done. And we haven't even gotten there yet. I look very much forward to the inauguration. It's going to be a beautiful event. We have great talent, tremendous talent. And we have the -- all of the bands -- or most of the bands are from the different -- from the different segments of the military. And I've heard some of these bands over the years, they're incredible. We're going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful. And I think we're going to have massive crowds because we have a movement. TRUMP: It's a movement like the world has never seen before. It's a movement that a lot of people didn't expect. And even the polls -- although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn't. And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour in. And we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they're gonna have a lot of security. They're going to have a lot of good news for their veterans. And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we'll do a news release in a little while. Tell you about David, he's fantastic -- he's fantastic. He will do a truly great job. One of the commitments I made is that we're gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. Our veterans have been treated horribly. They're waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal. Not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen. So, David is going to do a fantastic job. We're going to be talking to a few people also to help David. And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have. And we're gonna set up a -- a group. These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. And they're going to get together with their great doctors -- Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved. Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. And we're gonna straighten out the V.A. for our veterans. I've been promising that for a long time and it's something I feel very, very strongly. So, you'll get the information on David. And I think you'll be very impressed with the job he does. We looked long and hard. We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good. But we had a lot of talent. And we think this election will be something that will, with time -- with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good 'cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly. OK, questions? Yes, John (ph)? QUESTION: (Inaudible) so much. TRUMP: Thank you. QUESTION: Appreciate it. A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we're looking for further clarification on. TRUMP: Sure. QUESTION: First of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations? And secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC? And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States? TRUMP: OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified. So, I'm not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting. And -- but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out. I saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting. It's all fake news. It's phony stuff. It didn't happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap together. So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should have never been -- number one, shouldn't have even entered paper. But it should have never have been released. But I read what was released and I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an absolute disgrace. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I -- I can say that you know when -- when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China. We had -- we had much hacking going on. And one of the things we're gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled. You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world -- they were never in the same room together as a group. And we're gonna put those minds together and we're going to form a defense. TRUMP: And I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job. They could've had hacking defense, which we had. And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense. And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through. We have to do that for our country. It's very important. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... just to the last part of that question (inaudible) how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President Putin? TRUMP: Well, you know, President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news. They said it totally never happened. Now, somebody would say, \"Oh, of course he's gonna say that.\" I respected the fact that he said that. And I -- I'll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would've released it; they would've been glad to release it. I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would've released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her. I mean what he said about her was horrible. If somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would've fired him immediately or that person. Because what he said about her was horrible. But remember this: We talk about the hacking and hacking's bad and it shouldn't be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking. That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it? That's a horrible thing. That's a horrible thing. Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate -- it would've been the biggest story in the history of stories. And they would've said immediately, \"You have to get out of the race.\" Nobody even talked about it. It's a very terrible thing. Yeah? QUESTION: Can I ask you a question, sir? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election. Do you accept that part of the finding? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place? TRUMP: Well, if -- if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky. I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed. If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That's called an asset, not a liability. Now, I don't know that I'm gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there's a good chance I won't. And if I don't, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break. OK? QUESTION: ... President Obama... (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St. Petersburg, you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable... (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agencies? TRUMP: Lemme just tell you what I do. When I leave our country, I'm a very high-profile person, would you say? I am extremely careful. I'm surrounded by bodyguards. I'm surrounded by people. And I always tell them -- anywhere, but I always tell them if I'm leaving this country, \"Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras.\" I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category. And number one, \"I hope you're gonna be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know. You better be careful, or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.\" I tell this to people all the time. I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well -- Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well. And I told many people, \"Be careful, because you don't wanna see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place.\" And again, not just Russia, all over. Does anyone really believe that story? I'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me. (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business. But first, I have to follow-up on some of these Russian remarks. Based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it? TRUMP: So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. I have assets that are -- and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt -- I have very low debt. But I have no loans with Russia at all. And I thought that was important to put out. I certified that. So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict. So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals. Now, I have to say one other thing. Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai -- a number of deals and I turned it down. I didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president, which is -- I didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have. But I don't want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don't have, Vice President Pence also has it. I don't think he'll need it, I have a feeling he's not going to need it. But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president. It was many, many years old, this is for presidents. Because they don't want presidents getting -- I understand they don't want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country. So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don't like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can't do that in any other capacity. But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company -- the country. I'd do a very good job, but I don't want to do that. Now, all of these papers that you see here -- yes, go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) do you believe the hacking was justified? And will you release your tax returns to prove what you're saying about no deals in Russia? TRUMP: I'm not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they're under audit. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... since the '70's has had a required audit from the IRS, the last place to release them, but as president sir... TRUMP: You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? They're the only who ask. QUESTION: You don't think the American public is concerned about it? TRUMP: No I don't think so. I won, when I became president. No, I don't think they care at all. I don't think they care at all. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I think you care -- I think you care. First of all, you learn very little to a tax return. What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers. And actually, people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize, my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought. We're in many, many countries, and I'm very proud of it. And what I'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company. They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They're not going to discuss it with me. Again, I don't have to do this. They're not going to discuss it with me. And with that, I'm going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she's going to go -- these papers are just some of the many documents that I've signed turning over complete and total control to my sons. (CROSSTALK) DILLON: Good morning. It's my honor and privilege to be here today at President-elect Trump's request. He's asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he's taking. As you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned. President-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people's business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company. He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests. DILLON: As he said, he's voluntarily taking this on. The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets. The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it's simply inapplicable by its terms. And this is not just our interpretation. It's Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president. Even so, President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law. Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W. Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center. Mr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He's here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization. I'm gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking. First, President-elect Trump's investments and business assets commonly known as the -- as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th. Here is just some of the paperwork that's taking care of those actions. Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump. Further, at the president-elect's direction, the trust agreement provides -- that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns. President-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency. President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities. Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools. The president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics. Second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust. Through instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust -- President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric. DILLON: The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump's presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process. The president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could -- and I emphasize could -- be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues. The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval. To further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting. Another step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency. He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump's role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency. In sum, all of these actions -- complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights -- will sever President-elect Trump's presidency from the Trump Organization. Some have asked questions. Why not divest? Why not just sell everything? Form of blind trust. And I'd like to turn to addressing some of those questions now. Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization's assets. If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency. Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect. And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale. President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn't even feasible. Some people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now. Some people have suggested that the Trump -- that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter. It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization. Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. President Trump can't unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized. DILLON: Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump -- it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal. I'm going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That's a word I think we've all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before. And we're gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. Emoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says \"officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.\" The so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder. No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument. But since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm's-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn't even aware of. These people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument. The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires. So, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit. In sum, I and president-elect's (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we've outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family. We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect's desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure. The American people were well -- well aware of President-elect Trump's business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success. President-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) DILLON: You're welcome. My pleasure. Yes (ph). Don't want to lose your note. Thank you. TRUMP: Thank you very much. Here you go, you (ph). DILLON: Thank you. QUESTION: Mr. Trump? Thank you. Mr. Trump, (inaudible) from America News. What is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest? And do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your -- your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I -- I really think that when you watch what's going on with what's happening in -- I was just watching, as an example, Rex Tillerson. I think it's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying. I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general. And he was brilliant. And what people don't know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama. And he was brilliant yesterday. So, I really think that they are -- I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together. And we've been hearing that from so many people. People are so happy. You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it. When they needed something, he would be there. A friend of mine who's very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm -- big supporter -- he said there's nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson. And that's what we want. That's what I want to bring to government. I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we're way behind. We don't make good deals any more. I say it all the time in speeches. We don't make good deals anymore; we make bad deals. Our trade deals are a disaster. TRUMP: We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis -- hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody. We don't make good deals anymore. So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they're smart. And that's what I'd put, I'm very proud of the Cabinet, I think they're doing very well. It's very interesting how it's going, but it's -- I think they're doing very, very well. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... a quick follow-up on -- on Russia, sir. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. I wanted to ask a few questions on Obamacare? TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Can you be specific on what guidance you're giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Finally, Obamacare, I thought it was never gonna be asked. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare law? TRUMP: You're gonna be very, very proud, as not only the media and reporters, you're gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care. Obamacare is a complete and total disaster. They can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you. In some cases, they guide you incorrectly. In most cases, you realize what's happened, it's imploding as we sit. Some states have over a hundred percent increase and '17 and I said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year. It's going to be catastrophic. Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn't be fair to the people. We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don't wanna own it, we don't wanna own it politically. They own it right now. So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in '17 and believe me, we'd get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. We're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan. It'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour. So we're gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we're gonna get a health bill passed, we're gonna get health care taken care of in this country. You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high. Obamacare is the Democrats problem. We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them. We're doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service. So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we'll be filing a plan. And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times. And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare. We're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: President-elect, can we just ask you -- sir, sir... QUESTION: President-elect Trump... QUESTION: Mr. President -- which one? TRUMP: I was going right here. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: President-elect Trump, Jon Steinberg (ph) from Cheddar. When you look at all the meetings that you've had with Carrier, SoftBank and Alibaba, do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce? And then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts? TRUMP: Well, if I can save jobs, for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well, that's only one company, like we did a good job with Carrier. And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs. And they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot. But those were -- that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it's always tough when they're building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement. TRUMP: So I wanna thank United Technologies. But we've been meeting with a lot of companies. But what really is happening, is the word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason, it's not going to happen that way anymore. You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you're going to build that plant in Mexico and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you're making, and you're going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border -- not a weak border like it is -- we don't even have a border. It's an open sieve. But you're going to sell through a very strong border -- not going to happen. You're going to pay a very large border tax. So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina. You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan. You can do anywhere -- you've got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition. So it's not like, oh, gee, I'm taking the competition away. You've got a lot of places you can move. And I don't care, as along as it's within the United States, the borders of the United States. There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States that are -- 96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number -- that's the real number. So, that's the way it is. OK. Go ahead. QUESTION: President-elect, I have a question about the Supreme Court and border security. But I also wanted to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning. Are we living in Nazi Germany? What were you driving at there? Do you have a problem with the intelligence community? And on the Supreme Court, what's your timeline? You said a while ago you were down to four. Have you conducted those interviews yet? What's your timeline for nominating? And on the border fence, it now appears clear U.S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front. What is your plan to... TRUMP: That's not clear at all. OK. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... to get Mexico to pay for it? TRUMP: I've got it. Do you have any more? (LAUGHTER) On the fence -- it's not a fence. It's a wall. You just misreported it. We're going to build a wall. I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but I don't want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin. I don't feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half. We're going to start building. Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment -- probably less likely that it's a payment. But it will happen. So, remember this, OK? I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. I would then say, who is going to pay for the wall? And people would all scream out -- 25,000, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had. You know that. You don't like to report that, but that's OK. OK, now he agrees. Finally, he agrees. But I say who is going to pay for the wall? And they will scream out, \"Mexico.\" Now, reports went out last week -- oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. What's the difference? I want to get the wall started. I don't want to wait a year-and-a-half until I make my deal with Mexico. And we probably will have a deal sooner than that. And by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice. I respect the government of Mexico. I respect the people of Mexico. I love the people of Mexico. I have many people from Mexico working for me. They're phenomenal people. The government of Mexico is terrific. I don't blame them for what's happened. I don't blame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. I don't blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico. What I say is we shouldn't have allowed that to happen. It's not going to happen anymore. So, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed. OK? Supreme Court judge. So, as you know, I have a list of 20. I've gone through them. We've met with numerous candidates. They're outstanding in every case. They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society. Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he's a fantastic guy. TRUMP: So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople, we have a great group of people. I'll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice Scalia. That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. So within about two weeks, probably the second week. I consider the first day because we'll also be doing some -- some pretty good signings and I think what we'll do is we'll wait until Monday. That will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we're having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. So our first day -- and you'll all be invited to the signings, but we'll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week. And you're all invited. But on the Supreme Court, I'll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it's one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected. QUESTION: The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany, what were you driving at there? What are you trying to tell the American public? TRUMP: I think it was disgraceful -- disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it's a disgrace, and I say that -- and I say that, and that's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public. As far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up -- and by the way, we just found out I was coming down. Michael Cohen -- I was being -- Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer. He's a good lawyer in my firm. It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohen they we're talking about. So all night long it's Michael Cohen. I said, \"I want to see your passport.\" He brings his passport to my office. I say, hey, wait a minute. He didn't leave the country. He wasn't out of the country. They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen. It's a disgrace what took place. It's a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen. QUESTION: Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question? Mr. President-elect -- TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization... TRUMP: Not you. QUESTION: Can you give us a chance? TRUMP: Your organization is terrible. QUESTION: You are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir? Sir, can you... TRUMP: Quiet. QUESTION: Mr. President-elect, can you say... TRUMP: He's asking a question, don't be rude. Don't be rude. QUESTION: Can you give us a question since you're attacking us? Can you give us a question? TRUMP: Don't be rude. No, I'm not going to give you a question. I'm not going to give you a question. QUESTION: Can you state... TRUMP: You are fake news. Go ahead. QUESTION: Sir, can you state categorically that nobody -- no, Mr. President-elect, that's not appropriate. TRUMP: Go ahead. (APPLAUSE) QUESTION: Do you think President Obama went too far with the sanctions he put on Russia after the hacking? TRUMP: I don't think he went too far. No. QUESTION: Will you roll them back? What do you think of Lindsey Graham's plan to send you a bill for... TRUMP: Plans to send me a bill for what? QUESTION: Tougher sanctions. TRUMP: I hadn't heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that. Lindsey Graham. I've been competing with him for a long time. He is going to crack that one percent barrier one day. I didn't realize Lindsey Graham is still at it. That's all right. I think Lindsey Graham is a nice guy. I've heard that he is a nice guy and I've been hearing it. Go ahead. Go ahead. You've been waiting. QUESTION: As far as we understand, the intelligence community... TRUMP: Stand up. QUESTION: From BBC news. Ian Pannell from BBC news. TRUMP: BBC news. That's another beauty. QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you. As far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it. If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position... TRUMP: There's nothing they could come back with. QUESTION: Can you... TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) published fake news and all the problems that we've seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here? TRUMP: Well, I don't recommend reforms. I recommend people that are -- that have some moral compass. You know, I've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they're talking about people that go and say all sorts of things. But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody. I could name them, but I won't bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us. They're very, very dishonest people, but I think it's just something we're going to have to live with. TRUMP: I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back. When it happens to somebody that doesn't have this -- doesn't have that kind of a megaphone, they can't speak back. It's a very sad thing. I've seen people destroyed. I've seen people absolutely destroyed. And I think it's very unfair. So, all I can ask for is honest reporters. Yes? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the U.S. intelligence community. And be very clear about what you're saying. Do you trust your U.S. intelligence officials? And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community? TRUMP: Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important. We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo and others, you know the Senator Dan Coats. We're going to be putting in some outstanding people. Within 90 days, they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking. I want them to cover this situation. I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly -- because we're hacked by everybody -- you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it's number 17, in terms of protection. If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries -- they put this in the category of an industry -- the United States is last in terms of protecting, let's say, hacking defense. Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee. That's why we weren't hacked. By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren't able to hack. And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense. The Democratic National Committee didn't do that. Maybe that's why the country runs so badly that way. But I will tell you -- wait -- wait -- wait, let me finish. Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena -- fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody. That includes Russia and China and everybody -- everybody. OK. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead -- go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. President-elect, you said, just now, that you believe Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and Jon Podesta's e-mails, et cetera. TRUMP: All right, but you know what, it could have been others also. QUESTION: But why did you spend weeks undermining U.S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement? TRUMP: Well, I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. I think it's pretty sad. First of all, it's illegal. You know, these are -- these are classified and certified meetings and reports. I'll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody's leaking it out. So, there's -- maybe it's my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it's them. And what I did is I said I won't tell anybody. I'm going to have a meeting and I won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence. And what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn't know -- I didn't tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting. So, I don't want that -- I don't want that. It's very unfair to the country. It's very unfair to our country; what's happened. That report should have never -- first of all, it shouldn't have been printed because it's not worth the paper it's written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that. I thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President-elect, can you stand here today, once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign. And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now? TRUMP: He shouldn't be doing it. He won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading than when other people have led it. You will see that. Russia will respect our country more. He shouldn't have done it. I don't believe that he will be doing it more now. We have to work something out, but it's not just Russia. Take a look at what's happened. You don't report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that's because we have no defense. That's because we're run by people that don't know what they're doing. TRUMP: Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I'm leading it and I believe and I hope -- maybe it won't happen, it's possible. But I won't be giving (ph) a little reset button like Hillary. Here, press this piece of plastic. A guy looked at her like what is she doing? There's no reset button. We're either going to get along or we're not. I hope we get along, but if we don't, that's possible too. But Russia and other countries -- and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total. Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations. I want to thank everybody. So this is all -- just so you understand, these papers -- because I'm not sure that was explained properly. But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I'll come back and say, oh, you did a good job. Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I'll say, \"You're fired.\" Good-bye, everybody. Good-bye. ",

By Dan Balz January 11 at 3:47 PM Follow @danbalz President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first news conference in six months was a vintage performance. He was self-assured, aggressive, combative, at times willing to offend and at times trying to sound conciliatory. What it added up to was a reminder of the challenges he will face in gaining and maintaining full public trust once he is sworn in as president. No president in memory has come to the brink of his inauguration with such a smorgasbord of potential problems and unanswered questions, or with the level of public doubts that exist around his leadership. Though he dealt with the issues directly on Wednesday, what he could not answer \u2014 what he cannot answer until he is in the Oval Office \u2014 is whether he can avoid having these kinds of questions plague and possibly debilitate his presidency over the next four years. Trump and his advisers have dismissed much of the pre-inaugural controversy as part of an effort to delegitimize his election victory and undermine his presidency even before he takes office. Still, the questions swirling around him as he came to the lobby of Trump Tower were an unprecedented mixture of the personal, the financial and the substantive. Has he been compromised by the Russians, the most explosive and newest of allegations? (He denied all as fake news.) Are he and his party in conflict over U.S.-Russia relations? Will he truly separate himself from his sprawling business empire in a way that avoids conflicts of interest? Can he and Congress find common ground on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act? Will he live up to the promises he made as a candidate? The news conference put on display everything the country has come to recognize in Trump from the presidential campaign. For those who responded to his message from the start, for those who came to his side later in the campaign and for those who didn\u2019t but are prepared to give him some benefit of the doubt, it was a performance that no doubt went down well. (The Washington Post) Right from the start, he swung back hard against salacious and unsubstantiated claims of personal misbehavior contained in a document prepared by a former Western intelligence officer and now in the hands of the federal government. He aggressively chastised BuzzFeed for publishing the entire document online and CNN for promoting the story about its existence (though CNN did not publish the document). On the business side, he introduced Sheri Dillon, a tax attorney with the firm Morgan Lewis, to walk reporters through the steps he is taking to try to assure the public that he will serve its interests as president and not those of the Trump Organization \u2014 and to explain why many of the ideas proposed by outsiders arguing for taking bigger steps were impractical and likely to create their own potential conflicts. He said he is confident that he can keep his pledge to have Mexico pay for the border wall he intends to build, even if taxpayers initially foot the bill. He put Congress on notice that replacing Obamacare should go hand-in-glove with votes to repeal it. No easy task. He put drug manufacturers on notice that they cannot expect to do business as usual when he is in office. He offered the same message to companies that move production out of the country. On those matters, Trump\u2019s performance was at once giving no quarter to his tormentors, reminding his core supporters that he will make good on his campaign promises no matter what the skeptics may say, and at the same time trying to offer some reassurance to critics who worry about the possibilities for ethical abuses by the businessman turned president. In other ways, Trump also seemed eager to show that he has been hearing the criticisms of how he has handled the transition. For weeks he has been dismissive of intelligence findings that the Russians mounted a comprehensive campaign to meddle in the election and did so with the expressed aim of undermining Hillary Clinton and thereby aiding Trump. For the first time, he gave ground on that question, saying that he believed the Russians were behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the private emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. He also warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to engage in such activities when he is president. But with each step in that direction, he quickly walked back the other way. While he said the Russians were behind the hacking, he said the United States gets hacked all the time by foreign entities. Critics worry that he would cozy up to Putin. He said that \u201cif Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability.\u201d 1 of 18 ",

A Tucson police officer stands by to secure the event. Tucson officials say Trump owes them more than $80,000 in security and traffic control costs for the rally, according to the Center for Public Integrity.</p> Close Mamta Popat/Arizona Daily Star via AP At least three dozen municipal governments and law enforcement agencies say the Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaigns owe them hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign event security costs, according to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity. The nonpartisan, nonprofit investigative news organization based in Washington, D.C. reviewed federal campaign disclosures and municipal invoices and interviewed more than 60 local government officials. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be much debate about it \u2014 cities across America provided protection at a cost and should be reimbursed for it,\u201d Mayor John McNally of Youngstown, Ohio, told CPI. Youngstown is waiting the Sanders campaign to pay a nearly $6,000 bill for security the city provided during a March campaign event, according to the report. But who is responsible for footing the bills can be unclear, the analysis found. The Secret Service \u2013 the federal agency primarily responsible for candidate safety \u2013 usually asks for help from local police departments or other public safety agencies to secure campaign events, according to the report. But the Secret Service doesn\u2019t remburse municipalities for those costs, and election lawyer Eric Wang told CPI campaigns arguably aren\u2019t financially responsible either, absent a contract. While Trump\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t paid nearly $204,000 worth of police-related invoices and Clinton\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t paid at least $25,000 in bills, neither campaign acknowledges in federal campaign financial disclosures that it owes the cities, the analysis found. The Sanders campaign says in federal campaign filings it owes $449,409 to nearly two dozen municipalities and law enforcement agencies. ",

Cory Booker of New Jersey testified against the confirmation of his colleage, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, for US Attorney General.  (Jan. 11) AP Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., listens at left as Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Jan. 11, 2017, at the second day of a confirmation hearing for Attorney General-designate, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Photo: Cliff Owen, AP) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Black lawmakers said Wednesday that Sen. Jeff Sessions at times has shown hostility toward civil rights, making him unfit to be attorney general, as a 1986 letter from the widow of Martin Luther King Jr. surfaced strongly expressing opposition to the Alabama senator. In the second day of confirmation hearings, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Sessions' colleague, and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who was beaten when he marched for civil rights in the 1960s, warned that Sessions could move the country backward if confirmed as Donald Trump's top law enforcement official. Booker said the \"arc of the universe does not just naturally curve toward justice, we must bend it,\" and the country needs an attorney general who is determined to bend it. \"Senator Sessions' record does not speak to that desire, intention or will,\" Booker said, noting his opposition to overhauling the criminal justice system and his positions on other issues affecting minority groups. Lewis told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the country needs \"someone who's going to stand up, speak up and speak out for the people that need help, the people who have been discriminated against.\" And Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, urged senators to reject Sessions' eventual nomination because he has \"advanced an agenda that will do great harm\" to African-Americans.

The Alabama Republican was rejected by the Judiciary panel in 1986 for a federal judgeship amid accusations that he had called a black attorney \"boy\" \u2014 which he denied \u2014 and the NAACP and ACLU \"un-American.\" Sessions on Tuesday called those accusations \"damnably false\" and said he is \"totally committed to maintaining the freedom and equality that this country has to provide to every citizen.\" Black pastors rally in Washington for AG nominee Jeff Sessions The lawmakers' testimony brought two days of confirmation hearings for Sessions to a close. He has solid support from the Senate's Republican majority and from some Democrats in conservative-leaning states, and is expected to easily win confirmation. But Democrats are using the hearings to try to show that Sessions \u2014 and Trump's administration \u2014 won't be committed to civil rights, a chief priority of the Justice Department during the Obama administration. On Tuesday, the NAACP released a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King, widow of the civil rights leader, in which she said that Sessions' actions as a federal prosecutor were \"reprehensible\" and that he used his office \"in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.\" \"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge,\" Mrs. King wrote. Mrs. King died in 2006. Richmond complained during his testimony that putting the all-black panel at the end of the hearings was akin to being made to go to the \"back of the bus,\" a reference to 1960s segregation laws. During his testimony, many members of the Congressional Black Caucus sat in the audience. Not everyone on the panel criticized Sessions. Three men who had worked with Sessions in Alabama and Washington, all black, testified in support. Jesse Seroyer, a former U.S. marshal for the Middle District of Alabama, said Sessions is a \"good honest person who is going to give all he has to make sure everyone is treated fairly under the law.\" Earlier in the day, Attorney General Michael Mukasey also came to Sessions' defense at the hearing. He wrote in his testimony that \"of all the insidious practices that have crept into our politics in recent times, I know of none more insidious than casual and unjustified accusations of racism, smears that once leveled are difficult to wipe clean.\" Posted!

Mr. Rubio, outlining a list of grievous Russian offenses in Syria, said he hoped Mr. Tillerson might adjust his answer. \u201cThose are very, very serious charges to make, and I want to have much more information,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. Mr. Rubio, saying there was plenty of public information \u2014 \u201cthe videos and pictures are there,\u201d he noted \u2014 said that \u201cit should not be hard to say that Vladimir Putin\u2019s military has conducted war crimes in Aleppo.\u201d Mr. Tillerson did not budge. \u201cI find it discouraging, your inability to cite that,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. As the senator continued to cite the deaths of Mr. Putin\u2019s opponents, Mr. Tillerson said he hoped to learn more once he could receive classified information on the matters. \u201cNone of this is classified, Mr. Tillerson,\u201d Mr. Rubio shot back. \u201cPeople are dead.\u201d Photo Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, during the hearing. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Tillerson favored arms for Ukraine Mr. Tillerson also told the committee that if he had been serving in office when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 , he would have recommended that the United States provide arms and intelligence support to the government of Ukraine, and said the Obama administration\u2019s reaction was viewed in Moscow \u201cas a weak response.\u201d Mr. Tillerson\u2019s prescription came in the opening two hours of his confirmation hearing, where he went out of his way to portray himself as a hard-liner in confronting Russia \u2014 an effort to defuse questions about his business relationships with Mr. Putin. But in doing so, he put himself in direct opposition to the position taken by Mr. Trump, who said in interviews with The New York Times last year that he doubted the utility of the sanctions the United States led against Russia. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWhat the Russian leadership would have understood is a powerful response,\u201d said Mr. Tillerson, until recently the chief executive of Exxon Mobil. His message to the Russian leadership, he said, would be, \u201cYes, you took Crimea, but this stops right here.\u201d Kaine challenges Tillerson on climate change views Mr. Tillerson, facing questions about Exxon Mobil\u2019s history with climate science, admitted to at least a measure of strategic obfuscation during his testimony. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said that despite Mr. Tillerson\u2019s view on climate change, Exxon continued to provide funding to groups that obscure the scientific consensus. He asked Mr. Tillerson to clarify what Exxon Mobil knew about climate change despite its public claims through the years. \u201cSenator, since I\u2019m no longer with Exxon Mobil, I\u2019m in no position to speak on their behalf,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. Mr. Kaine reminded Mr. Tillerson that he was asking about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s own experience, which included more than four decades at Exxon. \u201cDo you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or do you refuse to answer my question?\u201d Mr. Kaine asked. \u201cA little of both,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, to laughs. Mr. Kaine also pressed Mr. Tillerson on Mr. Trump\u2019s potential business conflicts abroad. Mr. Tillerson said he had no knowledge of any of Mr. Trump\u2019s business relationships in Russia or elsewhere. Mr. Kaine asked about the ramifications of conducting diplomacy with foreign officials \u201cwho know more about the president\u2019s financial interest and exposure than you do.\u201d Mr. Tillerson said that \u201cas long as the objective of a negotiation is clear, that\u2019s all that matters\u201d to a prospective secretary of state. Advertisement C-suite and Foggy Bottom are different Photo Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland questioned Mr. Tillerson during the hearing. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, got to the key critique of Mr. Tillerson in an opening statement that challenged the nominee to explain what additional sanctions he would advocate against Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election and its activities in Syria. \u201cHaving a view from the C-Suite at Exxon is not at all the same as the view from the seventh floor of the Department of State,\u201d Mr. Cardin said, referring to where the secretary\u2019s office is. \u201cAnd those who suggest that anyone who can run a successful business can, of course, run a government agency do a profound disservice to both.\u201d Mr. Cardin argued that \u201cserving the narrow market-driven interests of Exxon shareholders is not the same as serving the national interests of all of the American people.\u201d And he challenged Mr. Tillerson to indicate whether he \u201cmay ignore Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, his illegal annexation of Crimea and his intervention in Syria,\u201d all of which President-elect Trump indicated, in an interview with The Times, were not high on his list of concerns. Mr. Cardin added that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s prepared opening remarks included no mention of Russian hacking, adding that he also planned to press Mr. Tillerson on his prospective business conflicts. Sessions criticized over comments on Trump tape Mr. Sessions was an ardent supporter of Mr. Trump, even after a tape surfaced in October revealing Mr. Trump making lewd comments about women and describing how he grabs them by their genitals. Testifying on Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Sessions said that behavior amounted to sexual assault. But his earlier comments, in an interview with T he Weekly Standard , resurfaced on Wednesday. SESSIONS: This was very improper language, and he\u2019s acknowledged that. TWS: But beyond the language, would you characterize the behavior described in that [video] as sexual assault if that behavior actually took place? SESSIONS: I don\u2019t characterize that as sexual assault. I think that\u2019s a stretch. I don\u2019t know what he meant \u2014 TWS: So if you grab a woman by the genitals, that\u2019s not sexual assault? SESSIONS: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not clear that he \u2014 how that would occur. Amita Swadhin, the founder of the advocacy group Mirror Memoirs, cited those comments on Wednesday and Mr. Sessions\u2019s opposition to expanding hate crimes laws as evidence that he should not be confirmed. \u201cWe have no reason to put our faith or our trust in Senator Sessions as attorney general,\u201d she said. Home court advantage Ms. Chao was to reintroduce herself to senators Wednesday morning \u2014 not as a former, long-serving labor secretary under George W. Bush, nor as the spouse of their majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, but as the choice to head the Transportation Department.

Andrew Cuomo to New York City was forced to make an emergency landing on Wednesday after the cabin filled with fumes. The Democratic governor, two aides and a security detail were flying from Albany when the problem began, prompting the pilot to land at Stewart Airport, Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi said. \"Just before 4 p.m., the helicopter filled with fumes that smelled like smoke and the pilot made an emergency landing at Stewart Airport,\" he said. No one was injured during the incident, Azzopardi said. The cause of the problem is under investigation. Cuomo returned to the city shortly after the emergency landing. Stewart Airport is located in Orange County about 60 miles north of New York City. Cuomo was in Albany to deliver the last of six state of the state addresses in six different locations around the state. Azzopardi said he was traveling to New York City for meetings in his Manhattan office. Cuomo later tweeted: \"3 days, 6 States of the State, 149 proposals, 9 hours of speeches, 1,260 miles & 1 emergency landing. Nothing can slow our progress.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Shanika Gunaratna CBS News January 11, 2017, 4:15 PM Culture etched on our DNA more than previously known, research suggests Supphachai Email Common ancestry, common culture, common environment \u2014 all these factors contribute to the genomes of individuals of the same ethnic groups.\u00a0 Now, for the first time, researchers say they have quantified the non-genetic aspects of race and identify for individuals of the same ethnic group.\u00a0 In a study published in the academic journal eLife, researchers examined DNA methylation \u2014 fingerprints of DNA that can be inherited or altered by life experience and shape how our genes are expressed \u2014among 573 Mexican and Puerto Rican children. DNA methylation reflects individual circumstances \u2014 for instance, PTSD stemming from traumatic experiences, air pollution from environmental conditions, after effects from maternal smoking, etc.\u00a0 Journalists from around the country spoke to CBS News about about their experiences covering an issue that hits close to home They identified 916 differences in methylation associated with Mexican or Puerto Rican ethnicity. Looking at that pool, the researchers identified that only three-quarters of the differences between the two ethnic groups could be explained by genetic ancestry.\u00a0 This led the researchers to theorize that a large fraction, one quarter, of the DNA fingerprints likely reflect biological signatures of environmental, social or cultural differences between the ethnic groups.\u00a0 Different racial and ethnic groups tend to follow different diets, live in neighborhoods with varying levels of poverty and pollution, and are more or less likely to smoke. DNA methylation can reflect these subtle cultural and environmental differences. Dr. Esteban Burchard, a professor of bioengineering, therapeutic sciences and of medicine at UC San Francisco, supervised the study, which was 20 years in the making.\u00a0 \u201cIt furthers our understanding of the whole concept of race ethnicity,\u201d Dr. Burchard, who collaborated with Dr. Joshua Galanter and Noah Zaitlen, said. \u201cIt tells me there\u2019s something biological to race. It tells me that we have a lot more work to do. Twenty-five percent of what we see is not due to biological differences, but things associated with the idea of race and ethnicity.\u201d The new research supports the theory that viewing race and ethnicity as social constructs on one hand, and genetic ancestry as a biological construct on the other hand, is way too simple a framework.\u00a0 Looking forward, Dr. Burchard said his team needs to explore whether these findings apply to other populations besides those studied. Scientists and health care professionals have increasingly considered both genetic ancestry and racial and ethnic identification to diagnose health problems and treat disease.\u00a0 The research suggests that abandoning considerations of race and ethnicity in medicine \u2014 as some academics, who view race and ethnicity as social constructs, suggest \u2014 would be a grave mistake, and that these lenses carry valuable insights for more precise and culturally specific medicine. The future of medicine, Dr. Burchard argued, carefully considers genetic ancestry, race, ethnicity and culture all at the same time. He published research back in 2011 showing how far the medical research establishment is from factoring in the nuances of race and ethnicity. That 2011 research showed that 94 percent of study participants in modern genetic studies are white, Dr. Buchard said.\u00a0 \u201cWe study whites a lot, and then we try to generalize that to Sri Lankans, blacks, Asians, and other racial groups. That\u2019s not just socially unjust, it\u2019s bad science and bad medicine,\u201d Dr. Burchard said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Email Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson did not rule out the idea of a U.S. registry for Muslims when he was asked about it his confirmation hearing Wednesday. Asked by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., if he would support a U.S. registry for Muslims, Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \u201cI would need to have a lot more information over how such an approach would be constructed.\u201d\u00a0 Sen. Marco Rubio grills Rex Tillerson about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tillerson says he would not call Putin a war criminal; and Rubio re... But Tillerson also added that if such a registry were used as a tool for vetting, it would probably extend to other groups. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, later pressed Tillerson on the registry again and Tillerson said, \u201cI do not support targeting any particular group,\u201d but he still seemed to leave the door open to some sort of database used for vetting people. \u00a0 Shaheen also asked Tillerson to share his view on President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s original proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.\u00a0 \u201cNo, I do not support a blanket-type rejection of any particular group of people,\u201d he said.\u00a0 However, another Trump cabinet pick rejected the idea of a Muslim database. On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary nominee Gen. John Kelly (ret.) agreed with Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., that such database would raise serious constitutional issues. He also said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor.\u201d During his confirmation hearing, Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, was questioned about Saudi Arabia's violation of huma... Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions rejected the idea of a Muslim ban during his confirmation hearing Tuesday. I do not support the idea that Muslims, as a religious group, should be denied admission to the United States,\u201d Sessions said. At the same time, Sessions suggested that he believes that religious beliefs, that embrace wanting to harm the U.S., can be taken into consideration in the vetting process and can be grounds to deny someone entry into the country. \u00a0 Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who says he is advising the Trump transition team on immigration policies, told Reuters in November that confidants of Mr. Trump were discussing proposals to reinstate a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries . In the wake of the 9/11 attacks in 2001, Kobach helped implement the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System ( NSEERS ), which required noncitizen men from certain Muslim-majority countries living in the U.S. to register and continuously update the government about their whereabouts. It also required individuals to go before immigration officials for fingerprinting, photographing, and comprehensive questioning. After heavy criticisms from civil liberties groups, the Department of Homeland Security eventually ended the controversial program in 2011. In late December the Obama administration announced it was officially scrapping NSEERS , though it has not used the program since Apr. 2011.

Russia's Cyber Attacks 'Clearly Troubling' Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the committee's top Democrat, said he found it troubling that Tillerson did not mention the Russian hacking in his prepared opening statement or how he will deal with a president-elect who ignored the findings of 17 intelligence agencies and may want to make a quick ally of Putin. Trump originally called into question the finding of the report that was supported by multiple U.S. intelligence agencies. After being briefed on the matter last week, Trump said nothing hackers did impacted the outcome of his victory. Rex Tillerson appears at his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill. NBC News When pressed by Rubio, the secretary of state nominee would not say whether he supports the executive actions taken by President Barack Obama in retaliation to the intrusion. Sanction Are a 'Powerful Tool' As a businessman, Tillerson has questioned the effectiveness of sanctions that could negatively impact his company. But on Wednesday said, \"Sanctions are a powerful tool, and they're an important tool.\" However he would not say whether he would advise the incoming president to support the sanctions put forward in response to the Russian cyber-attacks. Tillerson has resisted Democrats' claims that he ever lobbied against sanctions, with senators entering multiple lobbying disclosure forms and news reports into the record as proof Exxon lobbied against sanctions. \"It is difficult to think you actually don't know that Exxon was lobbying on the issues of sanctions,\" Menendez said. Tillerson has previously spoken out against sanctions . Let's be clear: we engage with lawmakers to discuss sanction impacts, not whether or not sanctions should be imposed \u2014 ExxonMobil (@exxonmobil) January 11, 2017 An Openness to Muslim Registry? The potential next head of the State Department did not rule out support for a registry of Muslim Americans. \"I would need to have a lot more information around how such an approach would even be constructed,\" Tillerson told Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. \"And if it were a tool for vetting than it probably extends to other people as well, other groups that are threats to the U.S. It would just require me much more information around how that would even be approached.\" Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions dismissed the idea of a registry during his confirmation hearing to become the next attorney general on Tuesday. He did, however, support taking immigrants religion into consideration when determining who can enter the country. 'Weak Response' to Russia's Incursion of Crimea Tillerson said Russia viewed the reaction to its 2014 incursion into Crimea as a \"weak response\" that only emboldened Moscow. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, right, listens to Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation at their meeting in the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, April 16, 2012. Alexei Nikolsky / RIA-Novosi/AP The U.S. should have advised Ukraine to put its entire military might on the Crimea border while providing intelligence support. \"It required a proportional show of force,\" Tillerson said of the intrusion. Tillerson: I Won't Tell Trump What to Say Tillerson did not have much of an answer to concerns from Republican Indiana Sen. Todd Young that Trump could undermine his authority as the nation's top diplomat with a tweet. \"There cannot be space between what you are saying, the policies you are putting forward, and the ones that are embraced by now the president-elect,\" Young said. \"I don't think I'm going to be telling the boss how he ought to communicate with the American people. That's going to be his choice,\" Tillerson responded. Though he has yet to take office, Trump has already taken to Twitter to preview his possible approach to foreign policy. Without warning, he has chided China for not doing more to prevent North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons and promised the country will not develop nuclear capabilities able to reach the United States under his administration. When asked if he had any plan to combat Trump possibly undermining him on social media, Tillerson simply said he has the president-elect's cell phone and would call him. Potential Conflicts With Tillerson's Business Dealings Tillerson's wealth and his ability to separate his business interests from the interests of the nation will also likely be a major focus of the hearing. The oil man holds almost $500 million in total assets , some of which are in Russian and Chinese companies. He is an unconventional pick to become the next head of the State Department. But proponents of the businessman say his experience making deals around the globe have prepared him to become one of the nation's top diplomats. Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz helped introduce Tillerson, along with former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and lauded the businessman's experience as an asset for the position. \"To those who suggest that anyone who can run a successful business can of course run a government agency do a profound disservice to both,\" Cardin said in his opening remarks. Cardin said he has \"grave concerns\" about what Tillerson sees when he looks into Putin's eyes not because Tillerson is na\u00efve, but because Exxon's money helped fund Russia's crushing of opposition voices thru a Putin slush fund. Risk of Climate Change Does Exist Tillerson said the risk of climate change does exist and \"action should be taken\", a departure from Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt , who questions the impact of climate change. \"The increase in the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are having an effect. Our ability to predict that effect is very limited,\" he said. However later in the hearing, Tillerson was clear to say there will be no space between him and the president on climate change agreements and all will be under review. Andrew Rafferty ",

By Drew Harwell January 11 at 7:17 PM Follow @drewharwell President-elect Donald Trump will retain ownership of his company while shifting assets into a trust managed by his sons, a step that Trump and his advisers said will eliminate potential conflicts of interest between his public duties and private business. The move, announced Wednesday in Trump\u2019s first news conference since July, followed weeks of criticism from ethics experts and congressional Democrats who have said his financial entanglements could improperly steer his presidential decision-making. The announcement included a pledge from a Trump lawyer that the company would make \u201cno new foreign deals whatsoever\u201d during Trump\u2019s presidency, and that any new domestic deals would undergo vigorous review, including approval by an independent ethics adviser. In addition, Trump is giving up his position as an officer at the company, the Trump Organization, ceding all management responsibilities and agreeing to what his lawyers described as strict limits on communications with company executives beyond receiving regular profit-and-loss statements. Sheri Dillon, a tax adviser at global law firm Morgan Lewis, said Trump has sought to isolate himself from the business that will be managed by Trump\u2019s sons Donald Jr. and Eric and company executive Allen Weisselberg. 1 of 18 Photos from Trump\u2019s first news conference in six months View Photos President-elect Donald Trump took questions in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Trump, she said, \u201cwill only know of a deal if he sees it in the paper or on TV.\u201d She added that Trump also terminated all pending international deals. But Trump\u2019s continued financial stake in a global real estate and branding company is likely to remain a point of contention between the president-elect and federal ethics officials, who have said that full divestiture remains the only way to prevent conflicts. Dillon, who also wrote a widely shared letter last year that asserted Trump\u2019s tax returns were under audit, argued that taking steps recommended by some vocal ethics experts would trigger additional problems. A sell-off would have created additional conflicts, she said, while a blind trust would have been unrealistic for a real estate company with high-profile assets. \u201cPresident Trump can\u2019t unknow he owns Trump Tower,\u201d Dillon said, and he \u201cshould not be expected to destroy the company he built.\u201d The announcement inspired an unusual, and highly critical, response from the top federal official at the agency that works closely with presidential transition teams to ensure they abide by ethics requirements. Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, took the stage at a Wednesday event for the Brookings Institution think tank to say that Trump\u2019s decision \u201cdoesn\u2019t meet the standards . . . that every president of the past four decades has met.\u201d Shaub, appointed by President Obama in 2013, said the trust \u201cadds nothing to the equation\u201d because it\u2019s \u201cnot even close\u201d to a blind trust, and called other Trump provisions \u201cwholly inadequate.\u201d Shaub, whose agency administers financial disclosure filings and advises executive branch officials on avoiding conflicts of interest, does not have the power to force Trump\u2019s hand. The director said he spoke out in hopes the president-elect would fully divest. Some ethics experts also expressed alarm Wednesday that the changes leave plenty of room for foreign interests and others to enrich the president and affect U.S. policy. Richard Painter, who was ethics counsel in the George W. Bush White House, said the setup will not prevent Trump from knowing his business\u2019 sources of revenue or block him from receiving income from the trust. Trump Tower projects still stand, for instance, in the Philippines, Turkey, Uruguay and other hot spots where foreign buyers or governments could still lavish money on the Trump brand. \u201cHe still has businesses all over the world, and we still do not know who is financing those businesses and who he\u2019s indebted to,\u201d Painter said. Referring to the yet-unnamed expert who would be hired to sign off on new deals, Painter added: \u201cThat ethics adviser is going to have a lot of work to do. Sounds like he\u2019ll need air support.\u201d Trump also retained his ownership share of the luxury hotel he opened last year in the Old Post Office Pavilion down the street from the White House, despite criticism that foreign leaders might try to curry favor with the administration by doing business there and at his other hotels, possibly violating the Constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments clause.\u201d The clause has never been tested in the courts, but it is upheld by threat of impeachment, and some scholars say Trump risks violating it the day he\u2019s sworn into office. The Washington hotel, of which Trump owns 76\u00a0percent, has been frequented by foreign diplomats since the election. Trump himself has signed for hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate loans from foreign banks and is currently involved in deals with foreign investors across several continents. Dillon, Trump\u2019s attorney, dismissed the suggestion of a problem, saying the clause would not apply to \u201carms\u2019-length transactions the president-elect has nothing to do with,\u201d such as hotel stays for foreign diplomats. Nevertheless, Dillon said, the hotel would donate \u201call profits from foreign government payments\u201d from the Trump International Hotel to the U.S. Treasury. In his news conference Wednesday at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump showcased his signature theatrics. He stood by several stacks of what he said were legal papers related to the Trump Organization changes. He noted repeatedly that the president is not covered by any conflict-of-interest laws, and that he was sure he could do a good job leading both the company and the country if he so chose. \u201cI could actually run my business and run government at the same time,\u201d he said. But, he added later, \u201cI don\u2019t want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don\u2019t have.\u201d And if his sons \u201cdo a bad job,\u201d Trump added, he will tell them his catchphrase from \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d Trump said his commitment to focus on the presidency has already cost him business, adding he had in recent days turned down $2\u00a0billion to do \u201ca number of deals\u201d in Dubai with Hussain Sajwani, the billionaire chairman of the Damac Properties development firm and a man Trump has called a friend. A Damac executive said the company \u201cconfirms that the discussions took place as stated in the media briefing but the proposals were declined by the Trump Organization,\u201d and that the proposals \u201cwere for a variety of different property deals.\u201d Trump\u2019s plan will also include tapping a \u201cchief compliance counsel\u201d at the Trump Organization who will monitor the Trump businesses for \u201cany actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency,\u201d Dillon said. Neither Trump nor Dillon said who would fill the position, and requests to speak with company representatives were not immediately returned. The Trump Organization is a vast, worldwide collection of golf courses, hotels, condo towers and other commercial holdings spread across more than 500 business interests, financial filings show. Much of the company\u2019s revenue stems from deals with real estate developers and merchandisers, who pay the company millions of dollars to use Trump\u2019s name and image. Presidents are exempt from conflict-of-interest laws that force virtually all other executive-branch officials to sell off their business interests, as well as recuse themselves from public decision-making that could benefit their private finances. The president must still abide by bribery, fraud and corruption laws that could arise from potential financial conflicts. Modern presidents have followed a tradition of selling potentially problematic assets or sequestering them into a blind trust, overseen by an independent manager with unassailable control. The trust agreement outlined Wednesday will not be truly blind, critics said, due to Trump\u2019s family relationship to its leaders, his sons. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka will also step down from management of the Trump Organization and her name-brand fashion, jewelry and licensing companies, lawyers said. She will also restructure her involvement in potentially profitable Trump Organization deals and, instead, receive fixed payments from the revenue of what lawyers called a \u201cdiversified pool\u201d of unidentified projects. Fixed-income agreements are common approaches to addressing conflicts for spouses of those stepping into government. But, like her father, Ivanka Trump has not committed to selling off her ownership stake, leaving one of her largest conflicts unresolved. Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, who Trump will name as a White House adviser, will sell off much of his New York real estate and media fortune and resign from the family business to avoid conflicts, his lawyers said this week. Many questions remain. Trump has not released his income tax returns, which would give the most precise look yet at Trump\u2019s holdings, business interests and foreign accounts. Trump has blamed several years of Internal Revenue Service audits, among other factors, for his reluctance to release the returns. Presidents, by law, are audited every year and not required to release their returns. Trump\u2019s sons, too, have already run into the minefield of potential conflicts awaiting the president\u2019s family. Eric Trump said recently that he will leave his foundation, following worries that donors could receive special access or favors from the Trump administration. Congressional Democrats on Monday introduced a law that would force Trump and future presidents to divest their business interests and other potential conflicts. But their Republican counterparts have largely stayed silent on Trump\u2019s entanglements, or said they trust his judgment, drawing the law\u2019s success into question.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Dec. 8, 2016: Workers construct the viewing stands ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's January inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. \u00a0(Reuters) The stage is set for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2013 not just the traditional swearing-in platform on Capitol Hill, but a massive security presence amid protest plans to \u201cshut down\u201d the nation\u2019s capital. Most crowd estimates for the Jan. 20 festivities are far short of the record-setting 1.8 million visitors for President Obama\u2019s historic 2009 inauguration. But the throngs of spectators and protesters alike are enough to create transit, security and hospitality challenges. \u201cSecurity is my greatest concern,\u201d Missouri GOP Sen. Roy Blunt, chairman\u00a0of the\u00a0Joint\u00a0Congressional\u00a0Committee on Inaugural\u00a0Ceremonies, recently said. \u201cNo question that on inaugural day, this would be the most appealing target in the world.\u201d He suggested the city could have as many as 750,000 demonstrators alone. More than three-dozen law enforcement agencies are working together on security and safety plans in anticipation, including the Capitol Police, FBI, Secret Service and National Guard. Roughly 7,500 Guardsmen from across the country will come to Washington, along with about 3,000 police officers from various states, with the Secret Service taking the lead on security.\u00a0\u00a0 Essentially everybody involved already is rehearsing for the big weekend, which kicks off next Friday morning with the swearings-in on the Capitol\u2019s West Front, followed by official events including the traditional parade on Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House and the inaugural balls. The Joint Task Force -- National Capital Region -- 58th Presidential Inauguration has held several \u201ctable top\u201d sessions in which agencies plot strategy over a large-scale, three-dimensional map. \u201cIt\u2019s a rehearsal, but in the military we call it a drill,\u201d Navy Cmdr. Jonathan Blyth, the group\u2019s spokesman, told FoxNews.com on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for this since the last inauguration. We\u2019re focused to protecting and honoring a new commander in chief.\u201d The task force and its Capitol Hill counterpart are holding a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d this weekend for the swearings-in, the Presidential Review of troops and the parade along the roughly 2.5-mile stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue. Several protest groups planning large-scale demonstrations have permits in place and have already held organizational meetings, among them the collaborative DisruptJ20. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a series of massive, direct actions that will shut down the inauguration ceremonies and any related celebrations,\u201d the group says. \u201cWe\u2019re also planning to paralyze the city.\u201d Organizers say they are targeting everything from the parade to the balls and plan to use blockades and protesters to stop traffic, public transit and parties. The group RefuseFacism.org is planning a small-scale protest Saturday in the city\u2019s McPherson Square, just blocks from the White House, that organizers hope will grow into larger inauguration-weekend protests. The group burned U.S. flags this summer at the Democratic and Republican national conventions and this week tried to disrupt the Senate confirmation hearing for Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions to become Trump\u2019s attorney general. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to meet with [Trump], but I would say to him, \u2018You\u2019re a fascist. Your regime is illegitimate.\u2019 And it must not be allowed to take power,\u201d the group\u2019s Carl Dix told Fox on Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Dix acknowledged the group doesn\u2019t have a federal or city permit to protest but still intends to \u201cstop the regime.\u201d The two major groups with permits are a pro-Trump organization and the ANSWER Coalition, which turned out the largest anti-war protests during the Bush years and next weekend has a permit for a mass protest at Freedom Plaza, near the parade route.\u00a0 The other group is Bikers for Trump, a familiar presence on last year\u2019s campaign trail and visitors to both 2016 major-party conventions. The group\u2019s permit shows members at John Marshall Park, near the Canadian Embassy and close to the parade route. The biggest protest is expected to take place the following day -- the Women\u2019s March on Washington. Organizers have finally received a permit and estimate 200,000 attendees, with celebrities such as Amy Schumer and Scarlett Johansson reportedly among them. Blyth said the big variable next weekend, as usual, will be the weather. Eight inches of snow fell the night before John F. Kennedy\u2019s inauguration in 1961. \u201cThe weather is always the biggest challenge,\u201d Blyth said. \u201cWe\u2019re reading the Farmer\u2019s Almanac and always checking forecasts.\u201d The 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee will hold at least two official -- or \u201csanctioned\u201d -- balls.\u00a0 Among the other balls that week will be the Deplorables Inaugural Ball , at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, and the Salute to the Heroes Inaugural Ball, at the Renaissance hotel downtown. Trump boasted this week that so many people are attending balls and other events that dress shops are sold out. However, Calypso St. Barts women\u2019s shop, in Georgetown, said Wednesday it has plenty of options still available. \u201cWe still have many nice pieces, including some cocktail dresses,\u201d store manager Briona Jackson said. \u201cWe have items on sale and can get gowns from our other stores.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Griff Jenkins contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Trump Says Sons Will Take 'Complete and Total Control' of the Business By Alexander Mallin Jan 11, 2017, 11:59 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Tax Lawyer Lays Out Trump's Plan for Businesses 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump announced this morning that he will hand \"complete and total control\" of his vast business empire to his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and to Alan Weisselberg, a longtime Trump business executive, through a financial trust. In a long-awaited press conference, Donald Trump Sr. introduced Sheri Dillon, a lawyer at firm Morgan Lewis in Washington, D.C. , who he said organized a way to \"completely isolate [Trump] from the management of the company.\" Despite Trump's previous pledge to put his business assets into a blind trust, Dillon said that would not be possible. \"You cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses,\" she said. \"President Trump can't un-know he owns Trump Tower.\" Dillon announced Trump's protective plans to ensure he is not in violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits officials from accepting gifts or emoluments from foreign governments \u2014 which ethics experts have alleged Trump could violate without complete divestment from his businesses. \"The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here, but just like with conflicts of interest, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires,\" she said. \"He is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury. This way it is the American people who will profit.\" Dillon said that Trump's decision to separate himself from the Trump Organization was made \"voluntarily\" and noted that under U.S. conflict of interest laws the president and vice president \"are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets.\" \"He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit,\" she said. Trump suggested that he would be capable of handling his business responsibilities and the presidency concurrently. \"I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don't like the way that looks. But I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can't do that in any other capacity,\" he said. According to Dillon, Trump is relinquishing leadership and management of his real estate empire and will no longer be involved in decision-making with the company's new leadership. Several ethics experts contacted by ABC News after today's announcement scoffed at the suggestion Trump was effectively distancing himself from his business. \"Tragically, the Trump plan to deal with his business conflicts announced today falls short in every respect,\" said former Obama ethics czar Norm Eisen. \"Mr. Trump did not make a clean break with his business ownership interests as his predecessors for four decades have done, did not establish a blind trust or the equivalent, as bipartisan experts and [the Office of Government Ethics] called for ... Mr. Trump's ill-advised course will precipitate scandal and corruption.\" Richard Painter, the chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said the plan announced by Trump \"doesn't work.\" \"He still maintains ownership \u2013 the assets are not being sold,\" he explained. \"The sons are in charge of his assets which is a problem, but the bigger problem is that assets are not being sold.\" More importantly, \"President-elect Trump needs to release tax returns so we get a sense of involvement with Russia,\" Painter said.

    "text": "News Nation & World National politics Trump's boldest campaign promises are getting a reality check President-elect Donald Trump holds his first news conference since July 27, 2016, on Jan. 11, 2017, in New York City. During his campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly promised voters a \u201cbig, beautiful wall,\u201d an Obamacare replacement \u201c immediately \u201d and a new era for a Veterans Affairs agency that had \u201cfailed\u201d service members. He acknowledged Wednesday that none of it would be so simple. Trump, who was often content to gloss over details while campaigning,\u00a0is quickly grappling with the complexities of governing. Though\u00a0 Republicans will have majorities in the House and Senate\u00a0and control of the White House for the first time in 10 years, fissures have begun to emerge on how to deliver on their campaign promises. Repealing the Affordable Care Act, a Trump priority and\u00a0the animating force within the GOP since the law passed six years ago, has run into roadblocks since Congress convened last week. The debate centers\u00a0on whether to repeal immediately\u00a0without a replacement plan, which would leave millions of Americans without healthcare.\u00a0 Trump said he would produce his own plan as soon as his Health and Human Services secretary takes office \u2014\u00a0something that could take weeks \u2014\u00a0just one day after demanding that Republicans both repeal and replace the health law as soon as next week. He promised that both parts would happen together. \u201cIt'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously,\u201d he said, calling such a move\u00a0\u201cvery complicated stuff.\u201d Donald Trump holds first press conference in almost 6 months During a rare press conference, President-elect Donald Trump dismissed reports on Russia's influence campaign, refused to release his tax returns and reiterated his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Jan. 11, 2017. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images | C-SPAN)\u00a0 See more videos Republican leaders have considered a more staggered approach where they would pass\u00a0repeal legislation now that would allow them as much as two years and\u00a0perhaps more time to develop\u00a0a\u00a0replacement. \u201cWe need to do this right. We need to make sure there is a stable transition period so that people do not have the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said. \u201cThis is how we will keep our promise.\u201d The strategy is already in jeopardy. Resistance is growing among Republicans to take a first step toward repeal, approving a procedural budget package. The move had been\u00a0expected later this week, but some lawmakers are worried that it will set a repeal in place before an alternative is ready. A preliminary whip count showed the budget vote was in trouble. \u201cYou can\u2019t repeal it and replace it quickly. That\u2019s an oxymoron,\u201d said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), one of the earliest Trump backers in Congress.\u00a0\u201cHe wants us moving it through so we can put it on his desk right away.\u201d Donald Trump 's first press conference as president-elect.

In case you are just now waking up from a coma, let me tell you what happened Wednesday at Donald Trump 's first press conference as president-elect. (Yes, that Donald Trump! He will be the next president!) First, he has decided that his official position on the kinds of conflicts of interest that... (Alexandra Petri) Trump once again offered no details about what his plan might look like, other than promising to produce something \u201cfar less expensive and far better\u201d than the current law. As importantly, Trump provided no indication of how he plans to get support from congressional Democrats, who will be needed to pass any replacement to Obamacare. He said simply that the repeal and replacement would probably happen \u201con the same day.\u201d It \u201ccould be the same hour.\u201d And after months in which he blasted the Obama administration for mismanagement at the Department of Veterans Affairs, his opening remarks included a surprise announcement: David Shulkin, a VA undersecretary, is his choice to lead the department.\u00a0 The selection\u00a0came as a shock to veterans groups and represented a considerable setback to the network of nonprofits funded by billionaire industrialists Charles and\u00a0 David Koch . Trump had earlier left the impression he would be cleaning house at the department to implement a free-market approach favored by the Koch organizations that could shift a considerable amount of the care provided by\u00a0VA\u00a0facilities over to the private sector. Shulkin has been an outspoken critic of such an approach, making him a favorite target of the Koch-funded nonprofit Concerned Veterans for America. In a blog post in April, the group characterized Shulkin\u2019s performance taking questions from a congressional\u00a0committee as a \u201cshow of incompetence\u201d and reflective of \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with the VA.\u201d But Trump, who embraced much of the Koch-backed organization\u2019s reform plan during the campaign, passed over contenders for the VA post who favored the blueprint championed by Concerned Veterans for America. Trump appears to have balked amid warnings from mainstream veterans groups representing millions of former soldiers against abandoning the reforms implemented by the Obama administration in favor of an approach more oriented toward privatization. And on the border wall, Trump reminisced about the call-and-response at his rallies of \u201cWho\u2019s gonna pay for it?\u201d \u201cMexico!\u201d But he backed off of\u00a0 his pledge that he would demand Mexico pay for the wall right away, saying he was impatient to begin construction but that talks with Mexico might take longer. \u201cI want to get the wall started,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico.\u00a0And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.\u201d Trump\u2019s dilemma is not uncommon for presidents-elect, said Martha Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project. \u201cIn a campaign, it\u2019s black and white: Your proposals are good and the other guy\u2019s\u00a0aren\u2019t. And you lay out things that really aren\u2019t practical,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it better to just stick with what you said during the campaign, or is it better as you learn more to make changes?\u201d The challenge can be more pronounced for someone with as little governing experience as Trump. \u201cYou have to make compromises. It\u2019s the only way you do it,\u201d Kumar said. ",

And he tells reporters that repealing and replacing President Barack Obama's health care law would be done \"essentially simultaneously.\" (Jan. 11) AP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., left, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. (Photo: Yuri Gripas, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 After debating seven hours through the night, the Senate voted early Thursday\u00a0to take the first real step toward repealing Obamacare \u2014 a top goal of congressional Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump. Senators voted 51-48 to approve\u00a0a budget resolution that Republicans will use as a vehicle to speed through repeal of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. House leaders plan to take it up Friday. Senators began voting on 19 amendments to the resolution about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday before passing the budget measure about 1:30 a.m. Thursday. Republicans said the 2010 health care law is broken and must be repealed and replaced with something better \u2014 although just what that replacement plan will look like has not yet been revealed by congressional leaders. Critics of the law cite sky-rocketing premiums, high deductibles\u00a0and fewer health care choices for patients as insurers pull out of the program. \"When Obamacare\u2019s supporters forced their partisan law on our country, they promised an easy-to-use system; one that would lower premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs; one that would foster choice and allow families to keep the plans and doctors they liked,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"But it didn\u2019t take long for the American people to discover the truth about Obamacare. Too many\u00a0have been personally hurt by this law. Too many feel they\u2019re worse off than they were before Obamacare.\" Read more: Obamacare repeal jeopardizes mental health, addiction coverage Democrats said repealing the law will strip millions of Americans of insurance, leave people with pre-existing medical conditions unable to find coverage, and increase the nation's budget deficit by $353 billion over the next 10 years as the tax and fee provisions that pay for Obamacare are gutted. \"Ripping apart our health care system \u2014 with no plan to replace it \u2014 will create chaos,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \"If Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s women, kids, seniors, patients with serious illnesses, and people with disabilities who will bear the burden.\" \"Premiums will skyrocket,\" she continued. \"Out-of-pocket prescription drug costs will rise. And overall health care costs will increase. It\u2019s a perfect storm to make America sick again \u2014 and absolutely the wrong direction for families and for our economy.\" While Republicans are eager to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they have acknowledged that it could cause serious problems for Americans if the law is scrapped without a replacement plan ready to go. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Tuesday that \"it is our goal to bring it all together concurrently.\" \"We\u2019re going to use every tool at our disposal through legislation, through regulation, to bring replace concurrent along with repeal, so that we can save people from this mess,\" Ryan said. He did not offer details of what a replacement plan would include. At a press conference Wednesday, Trump said he is prepared to offer a detailed replacement plan as soon as his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary \u2014 Republican Rep. Tom Price of Georgia \u2014 is confirmed by the Senate. Republicans are using a procedural tactic known as budget reconciliation to prevent Senate Democrats from being able to block an Obamacare repeal. The procedure allows the Senate to pass a repeal with only a simple majority of 51 votes rather than the 60-vote super-majority required for most major bills. Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate. The resolution that the Senate passed early Thursday directs key committees to write draft legislation by Jan. 27 to repeal the health care law. Some Republicans want the deadline to be pushed to March to give lawmakers more time to come up with a replacement plan. Democrats offered amendments they knew would fail but that put senators on record voting for or against some of the more popular provisions of Obamacare. Those include a provision barring insurance companies from refusing to cover patients with pre-existing medical conditions and a provision that allows young adults to remain on their parents' health insurance until age 26. Republicans have said they plan to keep those provisions in whatever replacement plan they offer. 12398 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 175 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ikMoQs NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

His death was the first U.S. execution carried out in 2017. Christopher Wilkins, 48, was convicted of fatally shooting Willie Freeman, 40, and Mike Silva, 33, because he was angry that he was tricked into paying $20 for a rock disguised as a chuck of crack cocaine. Death row inmate Christopher Wilkins Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice via AP Wilkins was declared dead at 6:29 p.m. local time. (7:29 p.m. ET), Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark said. Wilkins did not make a last statement. The Supreme Court earlier Wednesday refused to block his execution. Wilkins argued that his lawyers did a bad job of defending him against charges. Wilkins admitted to the 2005 double slaying \u2014 and claimed he had committed another murder and other crimes \u2014 during the sentencing phase of his trial. \"I tend to want to take the easy way out,\" the ex-con truck driver told the court. \"I make bad decisions. I know they're bad decisions when I'm making them. I make them anyway.\" In his appeals, Wilkins has argued that his attorney ignored his wish to plead guilty and did not put on a vigorous defense and that an appellate lawyer had a huge conflict of interest, having already accepted a job with the prosecutor's office. Executions hit a 30-year low in the United States last year, in part because some states were unable to obtain the needed drugs or put lethal injections on hold after executions that did not go as planned.

President-elect Donald Trump speaks at his news conference at Trump Tower  on Jan. 11, 2017, in New York City. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) WASHINGTON \u2014 In an unusual rebuke of an incoming president, the federal government's top ethics official\u00a0Wednesday joined a wave of ethics\u00a0watchdogs denouncing\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump's plan to retain his financial interest in his global real-estate and branding empire. \"The plan the president has announced doesn't meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting and that every president in the past four decades has met,\" Walter Shaub, the head of the Office of Government Ethics, told reporters at the news conference Wednesday afternoon. He called Trump's pledge to step away from management of his company\u00a0\"meaningless from a conflicts of interest perspective.\" Shaub\u00a0and a slew of outside groups have urged Trump to divest his businesses interests and follow the example of recent presidents by stashing his holdings in a blind trust or a bland mix of diversified mutual funds and Treasury bonds. That would\u00a0avoid the conflicts that could arise between his official duties and his family's sprawling array of licensing, real estate and property-management firms, they say. In a news conference Wednesday, Trump made it clear that he won't give up his ownership stake in the Trump Organization. Instead, he\u00a0will move his business assets into a trust that his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump,\u00a0and a Trump Organization executive will manage. The incoming president will not participate in the running of the company, his lawyer Sheri Dillon told reporters Wednesday. She said his businesses will not pursue any new foreign deals during his presidency, but will seek new domestic business. A still-to-be-named ethics adviser will help the Trump Organization steer clear of potential conflicts, Dillon said. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, will not participate in the business either, she added. Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, is preparing to join the White House as a senior adviser to his father-in-law. Trump and his aides say their plan\u00a0establishes\u00a0a bright line\u00a0between\u00a0line between his presidency and business interests and note that conflicts of interest laws that govern most executive branch employees do not apply to the president or vice president.\u00a0\"I could actually run my business and run\u00a0government at the same time,\" a defiant Trump said Wednesday during a wide-ranging news conference, his first since July 27.\u00a0\"I don't like the way that\u00a0looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to.\" Trump said he recently rejected\u00a0$2 billion worth of business deals in Dubai. \"I turned it down,\" he said. \"I didn't have to turn it down.\" Dillon said the steps announced Wednesday \"will completely isolate (Trump) from management of the company.\" Shaub said OGE officials were\u00a0not consulted about Trump's plan and said\u00a0that the\u00a0incoming president could set the\u00a0wrong example\u00a0for other government employees, who must comply with conflict of interest rules.\u00a0\"The ethics program starts at the top,\" he said. \"I don't think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States of America,\" Shaub said. The continued wrangling over Trump's business dealings came\u00a0nine days before his\u00a0 Jan. 20 swearing-in , and his aides still were in the process of establishing the terms of the trust they say will be in place before Trump begins his takes office. Officials said they also were still interviewing candidates for the ethics adviser post. The election of a businessman with financial interests\u00a0from\u00a0Turkey to the United Arab Emirates is unprecedented in modern U.S. history. \"We are on the verge of witnessing the first for-profit president,\" said Robert Weissman, president of the liberal-leaning group Public Citizen, one of the groups urging Trump to divest. Noted\u00a0constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe took to Twitter to slam\u00a0Trump's plan as\u00a0\"totally fraudulent.\" 1/As I listened, my jaw dropped. Trump's workaround is a totally fraudulent runaround. A Potemkin Village of a trust at best. \u2014 Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) January 11, 2017 \"Trump's announced structure is cleverly designed to dazzle and deceive,\" Tribe added in another tweet, \"but it solves none of the serious ethical or legal issues.\" John Wonderlich, who oversees the pro-transparency Sunlight Foundation, said Trump's approach to \"governance and ethics repudiates decades of accepted norms for modern democratic accountability\" and said his presidency likely will\u00a0be \"mired in litigation, doubt, scandal, and crisis\" as a result. Dillon, Trump's lawyer, called his actions to step away from managing his company \"extraordinary.\" John Pudner, a Republican campaign finance activist who runs Take Back Our Republic, said he appreciates that Trump has begun to take some steps to wall himself off from his\u00a0businesses but said full divestiture would have been ideal. Trump and his aides argued Wednesday that voters aren't\u00a0troubled by Trump's business dealings or his refusal to release his tax returns. (Trump has cited an ongoing\u00a0IRS audit as the reason he's broken with the long-standing tradition of candidates' making their returns public.) \"The American people were well aware of President-elect Trump's business empire and financial interests when they voted,\" Dillon said. \"Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.\" Read more: Posted!

    "text": "By Glenn Kessler January 11 at 2:53 PM Follow @GlennKesslerWP For the first time since he was elected, President-elect Donald Trump held a news conference Jan. 11. Here are key revelations from his question-and-answer session with reporters in New York. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump finally held a news conference, but as is typical, he often made claims that have been repeatedly debunked or discredited. Here\u2019s a guide to 15 of his more notable statements, in the order in which he made them. \u201cIt\u2019s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis.\u201d Trump is exaggerating. During the primaries, he was a near-constant presence on television because he frequently\u00a0called in to interview shows. But he generally only held news conferences after primary contests. He last held a news conference on July 27. \u201cYou saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion-dollar plant in Mexico and they\u2019re going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.\u201d Trump claims credit for these announcements, but that\u2019s wrong. Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive, said the plan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump; he credited instead talks with the United Auto Workers. With regards to Ford, analysts say Ford\u2019s decision to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico has more to do with the company\u2019s long-term goal \u2014 particularly, its plans to invest in electric vehicles \u2014 than the Trump administration. It\u2019s easier for companies to find highly skilled workers to build new products, such as electric cars, in the United States than in Mexico. \u201cWhen we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China.\u201d Actually, the Chinese hack of 22 million accounts at the Office of Personnel Management was front-page news . The Russian hacking of the presidential election and the OPM hack are not directly comparable. The Russian campaign, as described by U.S. intelligence, involved more than just hacking, with the aim of disrupting and possibly influencing the political process. The Chinese hack had a more isolated goal \u2014 espionage. China appears to have wanted the material to engage in possible blackmail. Obama administration officials said the China case is different because it was purely a case of spying \u2014 something the United States does as well. U.S. officials also said that China responded to U.S. pressure after the hack was discovered, and there are signs its espionage activities have been reduced. China may have been receptive to U.S. pressure at the time because President Xi Jinping was about to visit the United States, and he did not want the hack to mar the visit. \u201cThe Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job. \u2026 And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through.\u201d This is an example of attacking one of the victims, the Democratic National Committee. But FBI Director James B. Comey said \u00a0there is evidence that older Republican National Committee domains were also targeted but none of the information that may have been obtained was leaked. Comey said that the Russians \u201cgot far deeper and wider into the [DNC] than the RNC,\u201d adding that \u201csimilar techniques were used in both cases.\u201d But Trump\u2019s remarks also ignore the broader implications of the unclassified intelligence report released on Jan. 5 \u2014 how the Russian government used Internet trolls and RT (Russia\u2019s state-owned international news channel) to amplify negative reports on Clinton and U.S. democracy. The Internet trolls started to advocate for Trump as early as December 2015, well before the WikiLeaks revelations began to be released on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. Meanwhile, \u201cRT\u2019s coverage of Secretary Clinton throughout the presidential campaign was consistently negative and focused on her leaked emails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism,\u201d the report said. (It does not mention that these attack lines mirrored attacks made by the Trump campaign.) \u201cLook at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking. That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn\u2019t report it? That\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d Trump overstates the disclosure about Clinton getting a debate question. During the Democratic primaries, a debate was held in Flint, Mich., to focus on the water crisis. Donna Brazile, then an analyst with CNN, sent an email to the Clinton campaign saying that a woman with a rash from lead poisoning was going to ask what Clinton as president could do the help the people of Flint. There\u2019s no indication Clinton was told this information, but in any case it\u2019s a pretty obvious question for a debate being held in Flint. In her answer, Clinton committed to remove lead from water systems across the country within five years. Lee-Anne Waters, who asked the question, later said Clinton\u2019s answer \u201cmade me vomit in my mouth\u201d because that was too long to wait in Flint. \u201cThis administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed.\u201d Trump greatly simplifies a complex situation . The Islamic State terrorist group arose in response to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it began to fade after the Bush administration surge in 2008. The civil war in Syria breathed new life into what had become a moribund organization. The conflict in Syria created a perfect vacuum in terms of governance, and so the civil war became an opportunity for the restoration of the organization. The Islamic State then saw opportunity to rebound in Iraq. One factor was the withdrawal of U.S. troops ordered by President Obama . But there was also rampant mismanagement by the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, which greatly degraded Iraq\u2019s\u00a0military and exacerbated tensions between Sunnis and Shiites. Speaking at his first news conference since winning the presidential election, Donald Trump defended himself from possible conflicts of interest with foreign governments. (The Washington Post) \u201cI have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we\u2019ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia.\u201d Trump is being misleading when he says he has stayed away from Russia. Trump repeatedly sought deals in Russia. In 1987, he went to Moscow to find a site for luxury hotel; no deal emerged. In 1996, he sought to build a condominium complex in Russia; that also did not succeed. In 2005, Trump signed a one-year deal with a New York development company to explore a Trump Tower in Moscow, but the effort fizzled. In a 2008 speech, Donald Trump Jr. made it clear that the Trumps want to do business in Russia, but were finding it difficult. \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,\u201d Trump\u2019s son said at a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication. \u201cWe see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\u201d Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, told The Washington Post in May: \u201cI have no doubt, as a company, I know we\u2019ve looked at deals in Russia. And many of the former Russian Republics.\u201d \u201cI have a no-conflict situation because I\u2019m president.\u201d This is basically correct . The law doesn\u2019t say the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest. But Congress, under Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code, did exempt the president and vice president from conflict-of-interest laws on the theory that the presidency has so much power that any possible executive action might pose a potential conflict. Speaking at his first news conference since winning the presidential election, Donald Trump defended his decision not to release his tax returns, saying the American people \"don't care at all.\" (The Washington Post) \u201cThe only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters. \u2026 You learn very little to a tax return.\u201d Trump is wrong on both counts. A Pew Research Center poll conducted Jan. 4 to 9 found that 60 percent of Americans believed Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns. Meanwhile, tax experts say that tax returns provide insight about a person\u2019s finances in several key areas. First, the tax return reveals a person\u2019s annual income. A person\u2019s net worth is not disclosed, but voters would gain an understanding of a person\u2019s cash flow. Second, voters would understand the sources of a person\u2019s income, such as how much comes from certain businesses, speeches, dividends, capital gains and so forth. Third, a tax return would disclose how much a person gives to charity. Mitt Romney gave almost $2.3 million to charity in 2011, while Bill and Hillary Clinton gave $3 million to charity in 2014. We know these figures because of information in their tax returns. Trump claims he has given $102 million to charity in the past five years, but a Post investigation found not a cent in actual cash \u2014 mostly just free rounds of golf, given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles. Trump\u2019s tax return would clear up exactly how much he has really given to charity \u2014 indeed, whether he has given anything at all. Fourth, a tax return would reveal how aggressive Trump has been on his taxes. There is no black-and-white approach to taxes; there are many gray areas subject to interpretation, especially regarding deductions. Trump frequently suggests that he knows how to game the system, so voters would learn whether he takes the same approach to his taxes. Finally, the tax returns would disclose what percentage of Trump\u2019s income actually goes to taxes. \u201cWe have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis \u2014 hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody.\u201d A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trump\u2019s comment that there \u201cbillions of dollars of losses\u201d in trade reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Chinese or Mexican goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would \u201cgain\u201d money that had been lost. President-elect Donald Trump called Obamacare a \"complete and total disaster\" and said he will be filing a plan to \"repeal and replace\" it. (The Washington Post) \u201cSome states have over a 100 percent [premium] increase.\u201d Trump exaggerates here, and appears to misunderstand a fundamental part of the Affordable Care Act. State-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. But the most common plans in the marketplace in 2017 experienced an average increase of 22 percent .\u00a0These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies. The vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about 8 in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, \u201canecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face.\u201d \u201cI want to thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs.\u201d Trump keeps counting jobs that were never going to go to Mexico in the first place. Union officials say the number of jobs saved at Carrier shrank to 730, once the official paperwork was submitted. Meanwhile, 553 jobs, focused on making fan coils, will go to Mexico, as well as 700 jobs from a United Technologies Electronics Controls (UTEC) facility. Another 400 jobs in the two facilities, mostly administrative, were never going to leave. In effect, Trump saved 37 percent of the jobs slated to depart. But Greg Hayes, chief executive of United Technologies, told CNN that even more jobs at Carrier eventually would be lost through automation. \u201c96 million really wanting a job and they can\u2019t get. You know that story. The real number \u2014 that\u2019s the real number.\u201d This is an absurd Four-Pinocchio claim, based on a real number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, relying on a monthly survey known as the Current Population Survey (CPS), shows that, as of December 2016 , 95.1 million Americans 16 years and older were \u201cnot in labor force.\u201d How is this number developed? Well, there is a civilian noninstitutional population of 253.9 million people, and 159.5 million are in the labor force. The difference yields the 95.1 million figure. But the unemployment rate is only 4.7 percent because just 7.5 million people actively are looking for a job and cannot find one. They are considered part of the overall labor force. In other words, you have to be seeking a job to be counted in the labor force. Who are the 95 million not in the labor force? The BLS has data for the year 2015. It turns out that 93 percent do not want a job at all. The picture that emerges from a study of the data shows that the 95 million consists mostly of people who are retired, students, stay-at-home parents or disabled. Trump is doing a real disservice by claiming 96 million really want a job that \u201cthey can\u2019t get.\u201d Speaking Jan. 11, Donald Trump slammed the release of an unsubstantiated intelligence report as \"something that Nazi Germany would have done\" and called Buzzfeed, the news organization that published it, a \"failing pile of garbage.\" (The Washington Post) \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.\u201d We cannot resist noting that Trump was the leading purveyor of false \u201cbirther\u201d claims, based on no evidence, that Obama was not born in the United States. He frequently claimed that Obama had spent $2 million to cover this up \u2014 a number he plucked out of World Net Daily, which promotes conservative-leaning conspiracy theories. ",

An air traffic controller at Coleman A. Young International Airport noticed an object around noon and notified airport security. Security officers later contacted police. It was not clear Wednesday how the man got onto the airport grounds and the runway, Detroit police Sgt. Adam Madera said. No signs of trauma were visible on his body. An autopsy was scheduled to determine how the man died. His name was not immediately released and police were trying to locate his relatives. The man did not work at the airport, Madera said. The airport, better known as City Airport, has two runways and is separated by surrounding neighborhoods by chain-link fencing. Industrial properties and mostly vacant lots are along the airport's western edge. A cemetery sits next to it. Homes are also in the area. Pro Air was the last commercial carrier to fly out of the airport when it stopped service in 2000. Now, the airport primarily handles air cargo flights. About 25 flights go in and out daily, airport director Jason Watt said. Located on 260 acres, efforts to expand the airport have failed in recent years. The city has considered privatizing it to save money. Detroit-bound passenger flights currently use Detroit Metropolitan Airport, which is in the suburb of Romulus. 0 Shares ",

President-elect Donald Trump holds his first news conference in nearly six months at Trump Tower in New York. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times) During his campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly promised voters a \u201cbig, beautiful wall,\u201d an Obamacare replacement \u201c immediately \u201d and a new era for a Veterans Affairs agency that had \u201cfailed\u201d service members. He acknowledged Wednesday that none of it would be so simple. Trump, who was often content to gloss over details while campaigning,\u00a0is quickly grappling with the complexities of governing. Though\u00a0 Republicans will have majorities in the House and Senate\u00a0and control of the White House for the first time in 10 years, fissures have begun to emerge on how to deliver on their campaign promises. Repealing the Affordable Care Act, a Trump priority and\u00a0the animating force within the GOP since the law passed six years ago, has run into roadblocks since Congress convened last week. The debate centers\u00a0on whether to repeal immediately\u00a0without a replacement plan, which would leave millions of Americans without healthcare.\u00a0 Trump said he would produce his own plan as soon as his Health and Human Services secretary takes office \u2014\u00a0something that could take weeks \u2014\u00a0just one day after demanding that Republicans both repeal and replace the health law as soon as next week. He promised that both parts would happen together. \u201cIt'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously,\u201d he said, calling such a move\u00a0\u201cvery complicated stuff.\u201d Republican leaders have considered a more staggered approach where they would pass\u00a0repeal legislation now that would allow them as much as two years and\u00a0perhaps more time to develop\u00a0a\u00a0replacement. \u201cWe need to do this right. We need to make sure there is a stable transition period so that people do not have the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said. \u201cThis is how we will keep our promise.\u201d The strategy is already in jeopardy. Resistance is growing among Republicans to take a first step toward repeal, approving a procedural budget package. The move had been\u00a0expected later this week, but some lawmakers are worried that it will set a repeal in place before an alternative is ready. A preliminary whip count showed the budget vote was in trouble. President-elect Trump's first press conference: What's clear and what was left unsaid Jan. 11, 2017, 3:24 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration: A breakdown of what Trump revealed to the media today, from business conflicts to Obamacare... (David Lauter) \u201cYou can\u2019t repeal it and replace it quickly. That\u2019s an oxymoron,\u201d said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), one of the earliest Trump backers in Congress.\u00a0\u201cHe wants us moving it through so we can put it on his desk right away.\u201d Trump once again offered no details about what his plan might look like, other than promising to produce something \u201cfar less expensive and far better\u201d than the current law. As importantly, Trump provided no indication of how he plans to get support from congressional Democrats, who will be needed to pass any replacement to Obamacare. He said simply that the repeal and replacement would probably happen \u201con the same day.\u201d It \u201ccould be the same hour.\u201d And after months in which he blasted the Obama administration for mismanagement at the Department of Veterans Affairs, his opening remarks included a surprise announcement: David Shulkin, a VA undersecretary, is his choice to lead the department.\u00a0 The selection\u00a0came as a shock to veterans groups and represented a considerable setback to the network of nonprofits funded by billionaire industrialists Charles and\u00a0 David Koch . Trump had earlier left the impression he would be cleaning house at the department to implement a free-market approach favored by the Koch organizations that could shift a considerable amount of the care provided by\u00a0VA\u00a0facilities over to the private sector. Shulkin has been an outspoken critic of such an approach, making him a favorite target of the Koch-funded nonprofit Concerned Veterans for America. In a blog post in April, the group characterized Shulkin\u2019s performance taking questions from a congressional\u00a0committee as a \u201cshow of incompetence\u201d and reflective of \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with the VA.\u201d But Trump, who embraced much of the Koch-backed organization\u2019s reform plan during the campaign, passed over contenders for the VA post who favored the blueprint championed by Concerned Veterans for America. Trump appears to have balked amid warnings from mainstream veterans groups representing millions of former soldiers against abandoning the reforms implemented by the Obama administration in favor of an approach more oriented toward privatization. And on the border wall, Trump reminisced about the call-and-response at his rallies of \u201cWho\u2019s gonna pay for it?\u201d \u201cMexico!\u201d But he backed off of\u00a0 his pledge that he would demand Mexico pay for the wall right away, saying he was impatient to begin construction but that talks with Mexico might take longer. \u201cI want to get the wall started,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico.\u00a0And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.\u201d Trump\u2019s dilemma is not uncommon for presidents-elect, said Martha Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project. \u201cIn a campaign, it\u2019s black and white: Your proposals are good and the other guy\u2019s\u00a0aren\u2019t. And you lay out things that really aren\u2019t practical,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it better to just stick with what you said during the campaign, or is it better as you learn more to make changes?\u201d The challenge can be more pronounced for someone with as little governing experience as Trump. \u201cYou have to make compromises. It\u2019s the only way you do it,\u201d Kumar said.
