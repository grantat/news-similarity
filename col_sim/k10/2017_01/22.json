    "text": "Politicians, Activists Rally Crowd at Women's March in Washington By Meghan Keneally Jan 21, 2017, 4:37 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Inauguration Met With Protests by Thousands in Washington, Around US 0 Shares Email Activists and politicians rallied huge crowds who descended on the nation's capital today for the Women's March on Washington this morning, the biggest of hundreds of similar marches taking place today. The rally featured speeches from women's rights activist Gloria Steinem, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, Madonna, actresses Ashley Judd and Scarlett Johansson and director Michael Moore among others. A group of largely women senators and other politicians took the stage together at one point, including Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, Claire McCaskill, D-MO, and newly elected senators Kamala Harris, D-CA, and Tammy Duckworth, D-IL, who addressed the group as did Rep. Maxine Waters, D-CA. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-FL, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, were also on stage. With the timing and sheer number of people involved, it comes as little surprise that there are various causes attached to the march, which was largely billed as a demonstration in support of women's rights and civil rights but for many has clear political undertones connected to the inauguration of Donald Trump. Thanks to everyone in this video at The @womensmarch in DC & other cities throughout our country and the world!! #GetInvolved #DontGiveUp pic.twitter.com/kZGY3a6VDx \u2014 swah-rey (@swahrey) January 21, 2017 While crowd estimates are fluctuating and have not been confirmed, the Washington, D.C., Metro system posted on Twitter that there have been 275,000 trips as of 11 a.m. this morning. By comparison, 193,000 trips had been taken by the same time on Friday ahead of the inauguration. \"Fired up, ready to go\": Participants in Women's March on Washington display signs as they file down Metro escalator https://t.co/nUo6MDKiOl pic.twitter.com/Xh1ZdV38sU \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) January 21, 2017 Steinem thanked the crowd for showing up, declaring, \"We have people power and we will use it.\" \"Thank you for understanding that sometimes we have to put our bodies where our beliefs are. Sometimes pressing send is not enough,\" she said to the crowd, many of whom wore bright pink knitted hats. John Minchillo/AP Photo Gloria Steinem, center right, greets protesters at the barricades before speaking at the Women's March on Washington during the first full day of Donald Trump's presidency, Jan. 21, 2017 in Washington. Steinem suggested that the size and energy of the gathering was a positive outgrowth of Trump's election and inauguration. \"This is the upside of the downside. This is an outpouring of energy and true democracy like I have never seen in my very long life. It is wide in age, it is deep in diversity,\" Steinem said. She praised \"our great leaders\" Barack and Michelle Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton \"who told the whole world that women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights,\" quoting Clinton's speech at a United Nations conference in 1995. Steinem then turned her focus to President Trump. The new president's \"Twitter finger must not become a trigger finger,\" she said. ",

    "text": "advertisement KOBLENZ, Germany \u2014 Declaring that 2017 will be the \"year of the awakening of the people of continental Europe,\" French far-right presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen joined fellow nationalists Saturday at a conference in Germany in a show of populist confidence as Europe faces a series of high-stakes national elections. Populist parties have been surging in polls in Europe and the leaders' mood was celebratory as they came together in support of one another, the day after Donald Trump was sworn in as U.S. president following a campaign buoyed by anti-establishment and protectionist themes. Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch PVV political party, Frauke Petry, leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), Harald Vilimsky, General Secretary of the Austria Freedom Party, Marine Le Pen, leader of the French Front National, Matteo Salvini, leader of the Italian Lega Nord, and Janice Atkinson, member of the European Parliament for the British UKIP political party. Sean Gallup / Getty Images \"Yesterday, a new America. Today \u2014 hello Koblenz \u2014 a new Europe!\" Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders said as he opened his speech under heavy security in the German city of Koblenz on the banks of the Rhine River. \"The people of the West are awakening. They are throwing off the yoke of political correctness,\" he said. \"This year will be the year of the people ... the year of liberation, the year of the patriotic spring.\" Wilders' anti-Islam Party of Freedom could win the largest percentage of votes in the March 15 Dutch parliamentary election. Le Pen, head of the far-right National Front, is among the top contenders in France's April-May presidential vote. And in September, Frauke Petry's four-year-old Alternative for Germany party hopes to enter the German parliament in that country's national election, riding high on anti-immigrant sentiment that rejects German Chancellor Angela Merkel's welcoming policy toward refugees. Related: France's Marine Le Pen: Trump Win Shows Power Slipping From 'Elites' The meeting of the Europe of Nations and Freedom group in the European Parliament also featured Matteo Salvini of Italy's conservative Northern League and Harald Vilimsky, the general secretary of Austria's right-wing Freedom Party, which last year narrowly failed to win the country's presidency. Far-right leader and candidate for next spring presidential elections Marine le Pen from France celebrates after her speech at a meeting of European Nationalists in Koblenz, Germany, Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017. Michael Probst / AP \"Just as Donald Trump in America shows the way out of a dead end, with new prospects \u2014 including for (resolving) international conflicts, we want to do that in the coming months and years for Europe,\" Petry told reporters. \"We are experiencing the end of one world and the birth of another,\" Le Pen said in her address to the conference. \"We are experiencing the return of nation-states.\" She denounced the 28-nation European Union as \"a force of sterilization,\" and assailed Merkel \u2014 whose name was booed loudly \u2014 for allowing in large numbers of migrants. \"Everyone sees that this migration policy is a daily disaster,\" Le Pen said. The first \"real blow to the old order\" was last June's British vote to leave the EU, Le Pen said \u2014 followed closely by Trump's election. Related: France's National Front Finds Support Among Millennials \"His position on Europe is clear,\" Le Pen said. \"He will not support a system of oppression of the people.\" She added that \"2016 was the year when the Anglo-Saxon world woke up and 2017, I am sure, will be the year of the awakening of the people of continental Europe.\" Left-wing protesters staged a sit-in outside the hall shouting slogans like \"No border, no nation, stop deportation.\" Not far away, demonstrators from the global AVAAZ activist group placed statues of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Josef Stalin, among others, in front of a landmark statue of German Kaiser Wilhelm. AVAAZ organizer Pascal Vollenweider said the statues of the dictators were meant to send a \"strong message\" to the nationalist politicians' meeting that \"global citizens are rejecting their old dangerous ideas.\" \"They are not fascists in jackboots, it's a different type of fascism, of course. But if you look at the ideas ... it's very dangerous, and we have to face it. These guys are carrying old, dangerous, fascist ideas,\" he said. Related: Germany's Right-Wing AfD Party Blames Merkel's Immigration Policy for Berlin Attack Marcus Pretzell, Alternative for Germany's European lawmaker and Petry's husband, denied accreditation for the meeting to German public broadcasters and several other German outlets. Public broadcaster ARD has said it was refused access for \"not meeting journalistic standards in its past reporting on the party,\" a claim it has rejected. Wilders said the nationalist parties won't be deterred if they fail immediately to achieve their election aims this year. \"We will win, I'm very confident,\" he said. \"And if we wouldn't, or if we would not win, all of us, the genie will not go back into the bottle.\" \"The people won't accept that kind of policy anymore,\" he added. \"We will be here not only next year but many years more.\" Associated Press ",

    "text": "Twitter YouTube A British police watchdog is investigating an incident last Saturday in Bristol in which an officer fired a stun gun at a black man who has served as a community-relations adviser for local law enforcement. Judah Adunbi, 63, was incapacitated after a confrontation with two officers who apparently mistook him for someone wanted by police. In fact, Adunbi has volunteered as a member of an independent advisory group for Avon and Somerset police, a panel established to improve relations between police and the local communities of color. A neighbor recorded the incident on video, shown above. \"Avon & Somerset police officers used the Taser on a 63-year-old man in Colston Road, Easton at around 9.10am,\" the Independent Police Complaints Commission said in a statement released Friday . \"A complaint from a member of the public who witnessed the aftermath of the incident was voluntarily referred to the IPCC by the force on 19 January.\" We've begun an independent investigation into the actions of @ASPolice after a man was tasered in Bristol https://t.co/mbcy865A6H \u2014 IPCC (@IPCCNews) January 20, 2017 In the neighbor's video, two officers are seen stopping Adunbi outside his home as he was walking his dog. They refer to a wanted man they are looking for, and ask him for his name. Adunbi refuses to give his name several times as he attempts to enter his front gate. Article continues after sponsorship Like everyone in the U.K., Adunbi has the right to withhold his name when stopped by officers, according to Avon and Somerset Police guidelines . After a break in the footage, the video shows one of the officers apparently pulling Adunbi out of the gate by the arm. Immediately after that scuffle, one of the officers uses her Taser on Adunbi. Once on his back, Adunbi appears to toss his wallet to the ground beside them, telling the officers to look at his ID as they handcuff him. \"You are under arrest for assault,\" one of the officers tells him. The charges were later dropped, the BBC reports . \"The way I fell, on the back of my head, I was just paralyzed,\" Adunbi later told the British broadcast network ITV . \"I thought that was it. I thought they were taking my life.\" He says his fear stemmed partly from a similar confrontation with police. In 2009, \"he won a wrongful arrest case against Avon and Somerset Police and was awarded compensation,\" according to the BBC. Since then, Adunbi has been a volunteer with the Bristol IAG, one of several groups that serve \"a vital role in helping us build trust, confidence and better relationships, especially with our diverse communities,\" according to the Avon and Somerset police . \"It's a little distasteful in my mouth,\" Adunbi told The Guardian . \"To know that one of the founder members of the independent advisory group, which was created some years ago in order to improve the relationship between the Afro-Caribbean community and the constabulary, and to be treated like this, it's difficult.\" Chief Superintendent Jon Reilly, Bristol area commander for the Avon and Somerset police, says the force voluntarily referred the complaint about Saturday's incident to the watchdog IPCC. He said he would like to answer further questions but could not, given the ongoing investigation. According to ITV, he added: \"I want to reassure the community the whole incident was captured on body-worn camera. Both officers were wearing it. \"And we're determined to understand what happened. That's why we've referred it, voluntarily, to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for them to assess whether an independent review is necessary. \"We work really hard to work positively with all communities and I can see no reason why that should change.\" The IPCC has asked members of the Bristol community to come forward if they have any further information. The group said it has not yet spoken to the two officers involved. ",

    "text": "Search Intensifies for 23 Missing in Italian Avalanche By colleen barry and paolo santalucia, associated press FARINDOLA, Italy \u0097 Jan 21, 2017, 6:13 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press One of the three children that were rescued from the avalanche-hit Rigopiano Hotel is transported to a hospital in Pescara, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017. Three children were rescued from the avalanche-hit Rigopiano Hotel on Friday. and transported to Pescara hospital. One of the rescued children brought to Pescara was Ludovica Parete, the daughter of Giampiero Parete, the man who escaped Wednesday's avalanche and first sounded the alarm by calling his boss. (Claudio Lattanzio/ANSA via AP) 0 Shares Email The strain showed on Fabio Salzetta's face. The maintenance worker at the luxury Hotel Rigopiano who escaped being buried under the deadly avalanche because he had gone to check the boiler told Italian media Saturday that he called for hours to find survivors, but no one responded. The scene, he said, \"felt like it was a dream. It was a nightmare.\" One of the people buried inside, and among the 23 still missing, is his sister. His voice shaking, he said he last saw her in the kitchen. Five people have been confirmed killed, including two hotel waiters, while nine, including four children who had been on family vacations, have been pulled alive from the reinforced concrete structure buried beneath as many as eight meters of snow last Wednesday. Doctors at the hospital in Pescara said one of the adults underwent surgery for a crushed arm, and was in fair condition, but that all of the other patients were doing well. The children were being moved from intensive care to the pediatric ward. Buoyed by the rescues on Friday, more than two days after the disaster, search crews were intensifying their round-the-clock operation, fighting against the clock and deteriorating weather conditions including fresh snowfall and freezing temperatures. \"The research is difficult also because the site is in a precarious equilibrium, that's why the interventions are made very carefully and why we cannot intervene with big machineries risking to modify a very vulnerable situation,\" said Titti Postiglione of Italy's civil protection agency. Instead, workers pushed ahead using saws, shovels and gloved hands, listening for any sounds that might suggest more survivors. Dozens of friends and family members kept vigil at the hospital, some growing frustrated at the lack of news. In one family, elation that 9-year-old Edoardo Di Carlo had survived in good condition was tempered by news that his mother, Nadia Aconcciamessa, a nurse in the nearby town of Penne, was among the dead. The toll also includes two waiters at the hotel, Gabriele di Angelo and Alessandro Giancaterino. Postiglioni said the high number of people still missing was giving impetus to the search. They include Di Carlo's father and the parents of 6-year-old Samuel Di Michelangelo. The search included sending sound-sensitive instruments down into snow-crusted debris. Rescuers passed crates full of chunks of hardened snow and ice to colleagues as they tried to penetrate deeper into the wreckage, creating the rough equivalent of elevator shafts to allow searchers to descend into the smashed hotel. Searchers also used devices that could pick up any electronic waves emitted by cell phones of the missing, said Walter Milan, a spokesman for the alpine rescuers. That voices haven't been heard lately doesn't mean no one is still alive, he said, explaining \"we know that thick walls and snow isolates\" possible voices. Because of the continued avalanche risk, escape routes were planned for rescue crews and each participant was equipped with a tracking device in case they were buried under the snow. Snowfall higher than 3 meters (10 feet) thwarted the arrival of heavy equipment like cranes, said rescue spokesman Marco Bini, leaving the searchers to often rely on their hands or simple snow shovels to make progress. Salzetta has been spending time at the hotel rescue operation advising crews on the hotel's layout and guests' possible locations. Talking to reporters as he left the area, he recalled that the guests had gathered to go home, some shaken by the four quakes that day, but their departure was stymied by heavy snowfall that had made the road out impassable. \"In the end, they were calm. No one imagined that something like this could happen, after all the earthquakes that there have been,\" Salzetta said. The last thing he remembers of that night: \"The snow. Everything snow.\" \u2014\u2014 Barry reported from Pescara. Giulia Saudelli contributed from Penne and AP writer Frances D'Emilio contributed from Rome . 0 Shares ",

That sight is now burned into my eyes forever,\u201d Warren told the crowd, which the Boston mayor\u2019s office estimated was reached many as 150,000 people. \u201cAnd I hope the same is true for you \u2014 because we will not forget. We do not want to forget. We will use that vision to make sure that we fight harder, we fight tougher, and we fight more passionately than ever \u2014 not just for the people whom Donald Trump supports, but for all of America.\u201d \u201cWe can whimper, we can whine, or we can fight back. Me? I\u2019m here to fight back,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cWe come here to stand shoulder to shoulder to make clear: We are here, we will not be silent, we will not play dead, we will fight for what we believe in.\u201d The Boston march was just one of dozens across the country and around the world Saturday to protest after the inauguration of President Donald Trump . What started with an event in the nation\u2019s capital, the Women\u2019s March on Washington , quickly grew to include other cities across the country and worldwide. Women's March, in Washington and around the world \u201cWe\u2019re here today because of the power of women -- the power of women to come up with good ideas, like this rally,\u201d she said. \u201cThe power of women to organize, like this rally. And the power of women to make sure that as our country enters a new political era that the voices of the people will be heard.\u201d Like other speakers in D.C. and across the country, Warren stressed the importance of tolerance and equality. Watch Aja Monet recite poetry \u201cWe believe that sexism, racism, homophobia, and bigotry have no place in this country,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBlack lives matter; diversity makes our country stronger. We believe that equal means equal and that\u2019s true in the workplace, it\u2019s true in marriage, it\u2019s true every place.\u201d She spoke about Republicans\u2019 plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act , the new president\u2019s stance on climate change and his \u201cbuild a wall\u201d hard-line stance on immigration. \u201cTrump and the Republicans promise to make America worse,\u201d she said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

You can't burn things in the streets with the anarchists or day-drink like many despondent Democratic staffers. If you're California Rep. Barbara Lee, who represents Berkeley and distinguished herself early in the last great era of liberal opposition by being the only member of Congress to vote against George W. Bush's post-9/11 military authorization, you hang out with Michael Moore and prepare to go once more into the breach.

And on her very first day in #TheResistance, as Trump's opponents have started branding themselves, she was forced to go underground. With city streets turned into a virtual police-state for the swearing in, Lee had to take the metro downtown. \"I don't think there's much to celebrate,\" she said of the Inauguration as she rode from her D.C. condo to a counter-programming event sponsored by The Huffington Post and Bustle at the National Press Club. Lee had flown back to D.C. the night before from California, where she had held a meeting with DREAMers who, with tears in their eyes, expressed their fears about a Trump presidency. \"For me to sit there on the platform and clap and pretend like everything's normal -- I don't think so,\" she said. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) and a staffer ride the Metro to an anti-Trump event on Inauguration Day. Alex Seitz-Wald / NBC News Lee's district includes both Oakland, the birthplace of the Blank Panthers, and Berkeley, the Mecca of left-wing activism since at least 1960s \"We set the standard for the rest of the state of California, which sets the standard for the rest of the country,\" she said. It's something Lee's been doing for some time. In college, she worked for Black Panthers co-founder Bobby Seale's Oakland mayoral campaign, and was president of the Black Student Union. She didn't vote because \"I thought voting was bourgeois and I was a revolutionary,\" she recalled with a laugh. That changed after she met Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress, and worked on her 1972 presidential campaign. Given her constituency Lee cannot be too aggressive in opposing Trump. In November, Lee was re-elected to her 18th year in Congress with 91 percent of the vote -- a modest improvement over her 88.5 percent finish in 2014, giving her the biggest victory of any of California's 52 members of Congress. She has been chairwoman of both the Congressional Black Caucus and Progressive Caucus. But this administration will be very different from fighting Bush, she says. There was one issue with Bush -- the war -- while she believes opposing Trump requires a multi-front effort that will have to unite various progressive factions. \"It gives us an opportunity that we did not have under Bush,\" she said, hoping it will help liberals see the intersections of their various causes. Many of Lee's colleagues who did attend the Inauguration wore blue buttons defending Obamacare, which is just one of at least a dozen progressive accomplishments on the chopping block. But Trump just the latest fight, Lee says, from slavery to Jim Crow to Civil Rights, and she sees part of her job as bucking up liberals for battle and telling as many as possible they can't give into discouragement. Back above ground, protesters were attempting to block the street near the Press Club. But one recognized Lee, reached out his arm and pulled her through. Outside, protesters were burning trash, breaking store windows, and heaving bricks at police. Inside, \"Hamilton\" was playing. Ellen Page, the Canadian actress and activist, politely declined an interview request. \"I'm a little emotional right now, sorry,\" she said, misty eyed. Play ",

Standing in front of a memorial for fallen CIA agents, Trump assured intelligence officials, \"I am so behind you.\" He made no mention of his repeated criticism of the intelligence agencies following the election, including his public challenges of their high-confidence assessment that Russia meddled in the White House race to help him win. \"There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and CIA than Donald Trump,\" he said, blaming any suggestion of a \"feud\" on the media. Trump's decision to travel to CIA headquarters so quickly after taking office was seen as an attempt at a fresh start with the intelligence agencies he will now rely on for guidance as he makes weighty national security decisions. Following his private meeting with top CIA leaders, Trump said the U.S. had been \"restrained\" in its efforts to combat terrorism, calling the threat \"a level of evil we haven't seen.\" Donald Trump amplified his already heated war with the intelligence community Wednesday, accusing agents\u00a0of leaking an ugly and unsubstantiated report about him\u00a0while comparing the tactic\u00a0to Nazis. The showdown threatens to further undermine\u00a0trust between the next commander in chief... President-elect Donald Trump amplified his already heated war with the intelligence community Wednesday, accusing agents\u00a0of leaking an ugly and unsubstantiated report about him\u00a0while comparing the tactic\u00a0to Nazis. The showdown threatens to further undermine\u00a0trust between the next commander in chief... (Noah Bierman and Brian Bennett) Trump's visit to the CIA took place as throngs of women, many of them wearing bright pink, pointy-eared hats, descended on the nation's capital and other cities around the world for marches organized to push back against the new president. Hundreds of protesters lined the motorcade route as Trump sped back to the White House, many screaming and chanting at the president. The president appeared to be focused on settling scores with the media. He defensively touted the crowd size for his swearing-in ceremony, inaccurately claiming that the throngs on the National Mall stretched \"all the way back to the Washington Monument.\" Photos and video clearly showed the crowd stopping well short of the landmark. Trump is a voracious consumer of news and highly sensitive to criticism. As a candidate, he repeatedly disparaged the media and individual journalists to the delight of his supporters, and his appearance at the CIA underscored that he would continue to do so as president. He slammed a Time magazine reporter for incorrectly reporting Friday that Trump had moved a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. out of the Oval Office. But Trump followed with a misstatement of his own, saying the reporter had not corrected the mistake. In fact, the item was quickly retracted. High-level CIA brass stood largely silent during Trump's remarks, though some of the roughly 400 other officers in attendance cheered on the president during his remarks. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, slammed Trump for using his CIA visit to squabble over media coverage. ",

Protester holds a sign at the Women's March on Washington Phil McCausland \"I'm hoping Trump looks out the window and sees all of us here together, a united front, and he'll make a change,\" she said, brandishing a sign that read \"My Neck, My Back, This Pussy Will Grab Back.\" Her sign is a reference to the Khia song of 2002 named \"My Neck, My Back\" as well as a 2005 recording in which the president made a remark about grabbing women by the genitals. \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) January 21, 2017 Meanwhile, some folks were more unconventional and didn't carry the typical signage. Fifty-nine-year-old Donna Robinson, who is wheelchair bound but enthusiastic, earned cheers by wielding only a sweet potato. \"This here is our president,\" she said. \"He's rough on the outside. But if you heat him up, he turns to mush ... And we're all here to heat him up!\" Hundreds of signs from the Women's March in New York City piled in the Rockefeller Center subway station near the downtown F train.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) \"It seems as though we had all slipped into a false sense of comfort, that justice would prevail and that good would win in the end,\" the award-winning singer said. \"Well, good did not win this election. But good will win in the end,\" Madonna said. Later, she performed two of her hits, \"Express Yourself\" and \"Human Nature.\" During the latter, she led the crowd in a chant of \"I'M NOT YOUR BITCH!\" A range of other performers and activists, including singers Alicia Keyes and Janelle Monae, trans advocate and writer Janet Mock,and filmmaker Michael Moore, also appeared onstage.\u00a0 \u00a0 ",

The incident started a few blocks away from Trump Tower in the first block of West Kinzie Street about 11 p.m. when the officer told Matthew J. Jennings he was not allowed to walk in the street and asked him to move to the sidewalk, according to a police report. Jennings, 22, then pushed the officer off his bicycle, causing the officer to fall and hit the ground and suffer minor bruising to his left leg, according to court documents, which said the bike's rear derailler was damaged.\u00a0 Jennings tried to run away but another officer placed him under arrest. When Jennings got to the 18th District station to be processed he said of the bike officer: \u201cI didn\u2019t push him; he ran into me,\u2019\u2019 the report said. At the station, officers ran his name and found Jennings, of the 5500 block of North St. Louis Avenue, was also wanted on a warrant for an unrelated domestic battery. Jennings, who was charged with battery and criminal damage to property, both of which are misdemeanors, appeared before Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil who set a $10,000 bail at the Leighton Criminal Court Building. Jennings, whose mugshot shows a bandage under his right eye, suffered that injury earlier in the day, before his arrest, the police report said. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Jan. 25 in Branch 34. Jennings\u2019 attorney could not immediately be reached. ",

Angel Rodriguez at the Salute Our Armed Services inaugural ball Jan. 20, 2017, in Washington. (David J. Phillip / AP) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune One of Vice President Mike Pence 's last acts as governor of Indiana was to deny a request for disaster relief from East Chicago as it reels from a lead contamination crisis. So there was a certain irony that the Marine selected to dance with his wife, second lady Karen Pence, at Friday night's Armed Forces Ball in Washington, D.C., was born and raised in the hard-scrabble lakefront city. Sgt. Angel Rodriguez, 28, was, naturally, far too polite to upset the Pences' happy night by bringing that up. Instead he confidently spun the second lady about the dance floor to the tune of Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You,\" \u2014 terrifying his watching mom, Myra \u2014 and provoking laughter from the watching Tiffany and Eric Trump . The slow-shuffling President Donald Trump, Pence himself and the Trump children were all thoroughly outshined by Rodriguez's savoir faire. \"I can dance anything: rumba, hip-hop, salsa, you name it \u2014 maybe a waltz, or a foxtrot,\" the confident Rodriguez told Chicago Inc. before the Pences and the Trumps arrived at the event, attended by 2,500 members of the armed forces, cops and first responders. \"Who doesn't like to dance?\" If he was the calmest man in the room (Staff Sgt. Jose Medina, who danced with Melania Trump , ran a close second), it's understandable. ",

Caption The protest march, a rejoinder to the inauguration of President Trump, was the largest D.C. rally in years. Jan. 21, 2017 With U.S. Capitol in the background, a crowd fills the streets on Washington during the Women\u2019s March. Oliver Contreras/for The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Perry Stein , Steve Hendrix and Abigail Hauslohner By Perry Stein , Steve Hendrix and Abigail Hauslohner January 21 at 8:20 PM Follow perrystein Follow @SBHendrix Follow @ahauslohner More than a million people gathered in Washington and in cities around the country and the world Saturday to mount a roaring rejoinder to the inauguration of President Trump. What started as a Facebook post by a Hawaii retiree became an unprecedented international rebuke of a new president that packed cities large and small \u2014 from London to Los Angeles, Paris to Park City, Utah, Miami to Melbourne, Australia. The organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington, who originally sought a permit for a gathering of 200,000, said Saturday that as many as a half-million people participated. Many in the nation\u2019s capital and other cities said they were inspired to join because of Trump\u2019s divisive campaign and his disparagement of women, minorities and immigrants. In signs and shouts, they mocked what they characterized as Trump\u2019s lewd language and sexist demeanor. The marches provided a balm for those eager to immerse themselves in a like-minded sea of citizens who shared their anxiety and disappointment after Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic bid for the presidency ended in defeat. \u201cWe just want to make sure that we\u2019re heard,\u201d said Mona Osuchukwu, 27, a D.C. native at the Washington march with her 3-year-old daughter, Chioma. \u201cI want her to know that she has a voice. No matter what anyone tells her, especially as a black woman in America.\u201d (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) [ Women\u2019s March events underway across the country ] The Washington demonstration was amplified by gatherings around the world, with march organizers listing more than 670 planned events, including Tel Aviv, Barcelona, Mexico City, Berlin and Yellowknife in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories, where the temperature was 6 degrees below zero. In Chicago, the demonstration was overwhelmed by its own size, after 150,000 demonstrators swamped downtown blocks. It forced officials to curtail their planned march, although thousand of protesters still paraded around the Loop. In Boston, police estimated a gathering of 125,000. In Los Angeles, officials temporarily closed some side streets to accommodate the crowds. \u201cWe are doing our best to facilitate because they are squeezing into every street right now,\u201d said Capt. Andrew Neiman of the Los Angeles Police Department. There were also huge gatherings in New York, Miami, Denver and Seattle. In Juneau, Alaska, one man marveled that the crowd was the biggest he had ever seen on the state Capitol\u2019s steps. In Philadelphia, marchers filled city bridges. In Lexington, Ky., they shut down streets. In New Orleans, participants played brass instruments. The fear \u2014 and anger \u2014 at Trump\u2019s rise to the most powerful position in the United States reverberated at renowned protest sites around the globe, from the Trocadero in Paris to Trafalgar Square in London. (The Washington Post) Marina Knight, a 43-year-old executive assistant, and her 9-year-old daughter were two of the tens of thousands marching in London. \u201cThis is her first march,\u201d Knight said, referring to her daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we felt it was vital to march. I feel the rights we take for granted could go backward, and we owe it to our daughters and the next generation to fix this somehow.\u201d In the United States, the crowds marched in weather ranging from balmy to snowy. But common to every gathering was fiery rhetoric, pink knit hats, and repeated references to the boast that offended so many women: Trump\u2019s infamous taped comments about groping female genitals. Among the thousands of signs that marchers dumped at the end of the day in front of the Trump International Hotel, just blocks from his new home at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.: \u201cP---y Power\u201d and \u201cThis P---y Bites Back.\u201d Protesters got as close as they could to the presidential mansion, crowding metal barriers less than a block away as police and Secret Service personnel watching closely. Demonstrators came to Washington from around the country, sometimes sleeping on the couches of people they had never met. As of 4 p.m. Saturday, Metro had recorded more than 597,000 trips, a weekend ridership record. By comparison, as of 4 p.m. on Inauguration Day, there were 368,000 trips. The city issued about 1,800 bus parking permits for the march, and Amtrak added extra trains in and out of Union Station. The huge crowd delighted iconic feminist Gloria Steinem, 82, who was among the first speakers. \u201cThis is the upside of the downside,\u201d she exulted. \u201cThis is an outpouring of democracy like I\u2019ve never seen in my very long life.\u201d Clinton did not attend the march but tweeted her gratitude: \u201cThanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch. Important as ever. I truly believe we\u2019re always stronger together.\u201d [ Live updates: The Women\u2019s March on Washington ] The size of the gathering proved challenging. The audio from sound system failed to reach everyone in the massive crowd, and far more portable toilets were needed. When the port-a-potties behind the stage broke down, security instructed women to use cups and ushered them into a box truck for privacy. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to shake anyone\u2019s hand,\u201d one woman joked. Though the marchers were mostly female and white, men and people of color also joined the throngs. John Fischer, a 34-year-old locksmith from Grand Rapids, Mich., drove more than nine hours with his wife, Kara Eagle. I\u2019m here to support my wife,\u201d said Fischer. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, women impact your life, and there\u2019s no reason why they shouldn\u2019t have the same rights as men.\u201d Cynthia English, a 61-year-old Jamaican American living in Florida, said she wanted the new president to know that women will be fighting during his presidency to ensure that the country and laws treat them equally. She was with her daughter and marching for her two granddaughters in the hope that no future president feels comfortable making lewd comments about women. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to happen to them 20 years from now, so I am making my mark now,\u201d said English, who wondered, \u201cWhy are we the ones that bring people into this world, and we are treated the worst? We should be treated with respect.\u201d The crowd was buoyant, even joyous. Many held up signs \u2014 \u201cI Am Very Upset!\u201d and \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d and \u201cBridges Not Walls\u201d \u2014 while others took videos of the moment on their cellphones. Every few minutes, a rolling roar swept over them. D.C. police said they had made no march-related arrests, compared with more than 200 Friday when protesters created chaos in downtown Washington. [ Protesters vowed to shut down the city. Police vowed to protect the inauguration. ] March organizers briefly considered suspending the formal march to the Ellipse out of concern that the crowd had grown too large to safely navigate the route to the White House. But speakers soon told the marchers to set out. Lorraine LaHuta, 66, who came to the march from New York City, said at times she wasn\u2019t sure where to go, but it never felt chaotic. \u201cIt was organized disorganization that worked very well,\u201d she said. Judith Snyder-Wagner, a 67-year-old former fundraising consultant, came because she sensed a shift in the rural, blue-collar community near Canton, Ohio, where she lives with her wife, Joy. A neighbor mowed a piece of grass along their property line and put up a Trump sign facing their home. Someone recently drove through the neighborhood flying a Confederate flag. \u201cWe\u2019ve been afraid,\u201d she said, her voice quavering. She was limping up the sidewalk on Independence Avenue. She has had both her knee and hip replaced, and she held a cane in one hand and a poster in the other. \u201cWe just feel like we\u2019re going to lose our civil rights.\u201d The couple boarded a bus at 1 a.m. Saturday in Ohio and would head home less than 24 hours later. \u201cWe needed to feel inspired,\u201d Joy Snyder-Wagner said, looking around. \u201cAnd we do.\u201d Trump\u2019s election was the wake-up call that progressives needed, said Erin Edlow, 28, the membership director of the Virginia Beach Young Democrats. She was in town with her sister to demonstrate her support for the rights of immigrants and of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. \u201cDemocracy is not a spectator sport,\u201d she said. The march turned into a star-studded event, with celebrities such as Madonna, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Scarlett Johansson and Ashley Judd making appearances. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) introduced herself as a proud \u201cchick mayor\u201d and implored the Republican majority in Congress to stop meddling in the District\u2019s local lawmaking. Activist filmmaker Michael Moore ripped a copy of The Washington Post in half, noting the headline \u201cTrump takes power\u201d and declaring \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Actress America Ferrera declared that \u201cour new president is waging a war\u201d on the values that define the country with \u201ca credo of hate fear and suspicion of one another.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a heart-rending time to be both a woman and an immigrant,\u201d said Ferrera, whose parents are from Honduras. \u201cOur dignity, our character, our rights have been under attack.\u201d \u201cBut the president is not America,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are America.\u201d As the march grew in prominence, it highlighted long-existing racial and political rifts in the feminist movement. The initial organizers of the march were white women \u2014 a group that narrowly voted for Trump in November \u2014 although they quickly handed its leadership over to a diverse group of veteran organizers from New York. They have embraced an imperiled liberal agenda, in sharp contrast to much of what Trump laid out for his presidency. The march platform called for ending violence against women, workers\u2019 rights, reproductive rights, environmental justice, immigrant rights and more. But a group of women who oppose abortion also came, beseeching the larger march to recognize their variety of feminism. Whether to include the conservative viewpoint sparked controversy in the days before the march. Antiabortion activists said they were excluded. Siobhan Rooney, 32, drove from Philadelphia this morning to march for women\u2019s rights. For her, that includes the rights of their unborn children. [ Is there a place for women opposed to abortion at the Women\u2019s March? ] \u201cWe are in the same page on so many issues. It\u2019s just this one issue,\u201d she said. Teresa Shook , who is in her 60s, was on hand to marvel at what emerged from her original proposal for a march in a November post on Facebook. The grandmother of four from outside of Hono\u00adlulu accepted hug and after hug as the crowd surged around her. \u201cThis is the woman who came up with the idea for today\u2019s march,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThank you!\u201d shouted another. \u201cI\u2019m so blown away,\u201d Shook said.

The statement ended abruptly and left many reporters shouting questions that would go unanswered. USA TODAY NETWORK Some 30.6 million people watched Donald Trump's Inauguration on Friday. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports) Donald Trump's interest in his ratings and crowd sizes is well-documented. And his latest numbers are in. Nielsen reports 30.6 million viewers watched his inauguration\u00a0Friday.\u00a0Their analysis measured the\u00a0number of viewers who watched live coverage on 12 networks from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET. To put that number in perspective,\u00a037.8 million\u00a0tuned in to watch Barack Obama take the oath of office as the first African-American president in 2009.\u00a0That ceremony was the second-most watched inauguration in the last 47 years. Trump's swearing-in, which ranked fifth out of the 13 ceremonies in Nielsen's report,\u00a0was roughly on par with the first inaugurations of Bill Clinton in 1993 (29.7 million viewers)\u00a0and George W. Bush (29 million) in 2001. Ronald Reagan topped the leader board with 41.8\u00a0million watching his first inauguration in 1981. The third most-watched ceremony was that of Jimmy Carter in 1977,\u00a0which drew 34.1 million. Richard Nixon was the only re-elected president to get higher ratings the second time around. His 1973\u00a0ceremony drew 33 million,\u00a0good enough for fourth. 1713 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jLnKtq NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

Mandel Ngan /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption President Donald Trump speaks at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Va., on Saturday. Mandel Ngan /AFP/Getty Images On his first full day in the White House, President Trump went to the CIA presumably to try and offer an olive branch to members of the intelligence community he often maligned over their conclusions that Russia had conspired to influence the U.S. elections. Instead, he falsely denied that he had ever criticized the agency, falsely inflated the crowd size at his inauguration on Friday, attacked the media and told intelligence officers gathered to, \"Trust me. I'm like a smart person.\" It was a rambling speech that was reminiscent of many of his campaign rallies. But Trump did begin by praising the work that CIA officers do and the danger they put themselves in every day, saying they would be instrumental in \"making us safe\" and \"making us winners again.\" He made the speech in front of a wall of 117 stars representing those in the agency who had lost their lives in service. He called the memorial \"very, very special\" and said he had enjoyed touring the building prior to the speech. Article continues after sponsorship \"There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump,\" the president boasted, referring to himself in the third person. CIA Concludes Russian Interference Aimed To Elect Trump He said that the agency sometimes hadn't gotten the backing they deserved from the White House, and promised that \"you're going to get so much backing, maybe you're going to say, 'please don't give us so much backing'\" \u2014 adapting a line he said many times during the campaign. He ended his remarks by telling those gathered that, \"I love you. I respect you. There's nobody I respect more. You're going to do a fantastic job. We're going to start winning again, and you're going to lead the charge\" in helping combat ISIS. He praised his pick of Rep. Michael Pompeo, R-Kan., to lead the CIA, who is slated to get a confirmation vote by the full Senate on Monday. Trump called Pompeo a \"total star\" and a \"gem\" and said he may have been his most important Cabinet pick. Referencing his \"running war with the media\" and calling them \"among the most dishonest human beings on earth\" \u2014 a line which got laughs and applause from the crowd of CIA officers \u2014 he claimed that the press had misreported what he's said in the past. \"They sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community,\" Trump said. \"And I just wanted to let you know, the reason you're the No. 1 stop, it is exactly the opposite, and they understand that.\" In the wake of the intelligence community's findings that Russia engaged in cyberattacks intended to influence the elections in favor of Trump, he's accused them of leaking information to the press, likening it to \"Nazi Germany.\" He's repeatedly cast doubt on their findings, and after a Washington Post story in December reported the CIA conclusions, he said in a statement that, \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Are Trump And U.S. Intelligence Community Headed For A Showdown? But Trump continued bashing the media, launching into a tirade claiming that the crowd sizes during his inauguration yesterday were being misrepresented. \"We had a massive field of people. You saw that. Packed,\" he said. \"I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, they show an empty field. I said, wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out, it looked like a million, a million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.\" \"It went all the way back to the Washington Monument,\" Trump claimed. There are no official crowd estimates available for Friday's inauguration; the National Park Service stopped doing so after inaccurate estimations of the Million Man March in 1995. But according to aerial photos and multiple NPR reporters on the ground, the crowd was nowhere near the Washington Monument . The mall area near the monument was sparsely populated, and Trump didn't offer any verification for where the 1 million to 1.5 million estimate came from, or for knocking down one news report's estimate that there were only 250,000 people in attendance. Trump also claimed that the rain should have scared people away, \"But God looked down, and He said, 'We're not going to let it rain on your speech,'\" and that, though he \"got hit by a couple of drops\" when he started his speech that the rain \"stopped immediately ...and then it became really sunny.\" In fact, neither of those claims is true, and it was raining during Trump's speech and remained overcast and cloudy. Trump also touted his electoral win, saying that he had tremendous support from the military and said he would \"guarantee a big portion\" of people at his CIA speech voted for him. In fact, the military and the intelligence community are two separate entities. Several CIA veterans tell NPR they're unconvinced that the speech can undo months of bitter relations. \"CIA's employees are professionals and will serve the First Customer to the best of their ability, but they certainly aren't fools,\" said former CIA analyst Aki Peritz. \"They've all heard the hostile rhetoric directed at them from Donald Trump... and one prepared kumbaya speech isn't going to change the real concerns CIA's workforce \u2014 from the 7th floor to the greenest trainee \u2014 have with their new boss.\" Paul Pillar, the CIA's former top analyst for the Middle East, seconds that view. He says his former colleagues will welcome the gesture of a Presidential visit, \"but a single visit and a few nice words will not outweigh prior public disparagement. Unwarranted accusations about leaking and comparisons to Nazis are not the sort of attack that is easily forgotten.\" \"Much depends on whether Mr. Pompeo sees and performs his role as the White House's envoy and overlord, or instead as the leader of the agency with everything leadership implies, regarding identifying with the institution,\" Pillar said. \"All that remains to be seen.\" ",

You have a rich culture. Tragically, you are shackled by a theocratic tyranny,\" he says.

By Petula Dvorak By Petula Dvorak Columnist January 21 at 6:34 PM Follow @petulad Women everywhere. Pink hats, black hats, hard hats, no hats. A crushing polite crowd, well prepared with healthy snacks and tissues. A crowd so sprawling, it nearly covered the march route end-to-end. It was mighty and powerful. Best of all, there were men there. Thousands of them. Some wore the pink pussyhats. Some were just there to condemn President Trump. \u201cI just hate him. I am totally against Donald Trump,\u201d one guy told me, when I asked why he\u2019d come to the Women\u2019s March . \u201cThe women are fine, they\u2019re strong.\u201d No worries, dude. We\u2019ll take you. We\u2019re all going in the same direction, anyhow. Come along. And that\u2019s the key. Bart Goodell from Skaneateles, N.Y., marches down Pennsylvania Avenue during the Women's March on Washington. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post) \u201cWe are all the same,\u201d said 8-year-old Asa Bergander\u2019s sign. He gets it. When I asked him why he came to the march, he said, \u201cGirls don\u2019t get as much money as boys when they do the same work.\u201d Asa for president! Because boys and men who think like Asa are crucial for the next step in our long unfinished fight for equal rights, equal pay and equal opportunity. It\u2019s time for all men to stand with us in the boardroom and listen when we talk, to stand with us in the kitchen and help us run the house, to stand with us when we ask for a raise and consider what\u2019s fair, to stand with us when we are assaulted and believe what we say. [ From lab, to Olympic podium to White House, accomplished women are still dismissed ] We\u2019ve made it clear that we can drive trucks, try cases, fight fires, discover dark matter, construct buildings, operate on brains, fly planes and graduate from Ranger School. And in most cases, we can do all this while raising kids. Skills and stamina aren\u2019t the argument anymore. So what\u2019s standing in the way of true equality? Hearts. Men\u2019s hearts. We need you, men. We need you to see the sexism and discrimination. And lots of you already do. \u201cI\u2019m here because this affects all of us,\u201d said Fred Lado, a neuroscientist who came to the Women\u2019s March from New York. Women, he said, absolutely face \u201csystemic biases.\u201d And men need to stand up for women\u2019s rights the same way white people need to stand up for the rights of African Americans. Black Lives Matter. Feminism. It\u2019s all human rights, Lado said. That kind of Spock logic was strong with the science men. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of civil rights,\u201d said Paul Mason, 50, an aerospace engineer from Bowie. He came with his daughter, Chelsea, because he wants a future of equal opportunity for her and worried the new administration will not ensure that for her. The dads were awesome. \u201cI believe in equality for all people, and if that happens, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m losing anything,\u201d said Tim Murch, 42, a special-education supervisor in Emmaus, Pa. And you can totally get why all these Gen-X dads are doing this. Because what dad of a young child didn\u2019t blanch at our new president\u2019s brag on grabbing women by the genitals or boast about how hot his daughter is and how he\u2019d be dating her if they weren\u2019t related. Why else were men there? Is it because they believe that the women at their offices should be paid and promoted the same way they are? That women should get to make their own decisions about their bodies? That men should share equally in raising kids and caring for homes? Does that make all these guys closet feminists? It\u2019s complicated. Many of the men I talked to struggled a bit when I asked whether they were feminists. Which is weird, because it\u2019s like seeing white folks at a rally to end racism struggle with whether they consider themselves civil rights activists. \u201cWhat is the definition of the word?\u201d one guy asked. Another man leaned over and whispered in my ear: \u201cI\u2019m a lesbian trapped in a man\u2019s body.\u201d \u201cUm, I guess,\u201d another guy shrugged. Even Californian Kern Beare, 61, who has been on a month-long journey across the country with his son, talking to people and posting the interactions on his PoptheBubble blog, wrestled with the question. \u201cHmm,\u201d he hummed. He said he believes in feminine leadership styles of listening, cooperation and collaboration. And says that Trump doesn\u2019t have those qualities. But he wasn\u2019t totally into calling himself a feminist. Hmm. Then I found Albert Andersen. He\u2019s a 56-year-old welder from West Virginia. He wore a sturdy leather jacket and stood alone. \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of EVIL is for good (wo)men to do NOTHING,\u201d said his simple sign, written on brown cardboard in black ink. He voted for Hillary Clinton. He answered in short, two- and three-word bursts. \u201cAre you a feminist?\u201d I asked. \u201cLook,\u201d he drawled, leaning in close. \u201cI believe in equal rights. That\u2019s what this is about \u2014 equal rights.\u201d Amen, brother. And thank you for being there. Twitter: @petulad Read more Petula Dvorak: ",

    "text": "Trump moves to ease intel community tensions with CIA visit Published January 21, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President Trump visited the CIA on Saturday in a conciliatory bid to end a feud with the intelligence community -- a dispute he suggested was overblown by the media -- while making clear one of his top priorities will be to destroy the \u201cevil\u201d Islamic State terror network. \u201cWe have to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. Radical Islamic terrorism, it has to be eradicated,\u201d said Trump, on his first full day in the White House and his first official agency stop of his presidency. \u201cThis is evil. \u2026 We\u2019re going to end it.\u201d Trump\u2019s trip across the Potomac River to the agency\u2019s headquarters in northern Virginia follows a tumultuous past couple of months in which the U.S. intelligence community has suggested Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 campaign was meant to help Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 The CIA, FBI and other agencies in the so-called U.S. intelligence community recently issued a report that stated Putin and Russia meddled in the race, though it found no evidence of vote tampering. However, Trump last week suggested outgoing CIA Director John Brennan may have leaked an unofficial dossier on him containing embarrassing and highly suspect allegations, and compared the situation to living in \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d John Brennan has denied such accusations and said Trump lacks \u201ca full understanding\u201d of Russian capabilities and the actions the country is taking in the world. \u201cNobody feels stronger about the intelligence community than Donald Trump,\u201d the president said Saturday to loud applause. \u201cI love you. I respect you. There\u2019s nobody whom I respect more. We are going to start winning again.\" Trump suggested the news media, which he has repeatedly argued are dishonest and have treated him unfairly, overplayed his concerns about intelligence officials. He also accused the media of mischaracterizing the size of his inauguration crowds.\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to do great things,\u201d said Trump, who also tried to reassure the roughly 400 agency employees who assembled at the headquarters that his pick to run the agency now, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo, would advance the CIA and its mission as the country\u2019s top spy agency.\u00a0 Before joining Congress, Pompeo was first in his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served in the Army and graduated from Harvard Law School. \u201cEverything he\u2019s done is a home run,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPeople like him. People respect him. You are going to be getting a total star.\" Trump said during his winning campaign that President Obama didn\u2019t do enough to destroy ISIS, the upstart terror group that emerged in the chaos of the Middle East and has since claimed responsibility for dozens of terror attacks over the past several years that have killed hundreds. Trump began his first full day in the White House by attending the traditional, post-inauguration National Prayer Service. The roughly one-hour, interfaith service at the Washington National Cathedral included the National Anthem and a Muslim prayer. \u201cHold fast that which is good,\u201d said Bishop Mariann Budde, of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. \u201cMake no peace with oppression. Strengthen the weak. \u2026 Honor all people.\" Advertisement ",

Time Jared Kushner, left, senior adviser and son-in-law to President Donald Trump watches during the Inaugural Parade for President Donald Trump after he was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. (Photo: Justin Lane, epa) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The Justice Department has cleared the way for Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump, to serve as a senior adviser to the new president. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Daniel Koffsky, in a 14-page opinion, said that federal nepotism laws did not apply because the president is afforded \"special hiring authority,'' exempting positions in the White House from the law. Koffsky, a career department official, said the law covers \"only appointments in an agency,'' and that the White House is not classified as an executive agency. Earlier this month, Trump announced the appointment of the 35-year-old real estate developer, who is married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, asserting that the 1967 anti-nepotism statute did not apply. Some ethics lawyers on Saturday said they disagree with the DOJ\u2019s opinion and noted that it departs from earlier determinations about the nepotism law, which prohibits public officials from appointing relatives or promoting or advocating for their hire by entities they oversee. It expressly says the president is subject to the law and a son-in-law would be considered a relative under the statute. \u201cI would look at this opinion as saying, if you want to create an argument to allow Donald Trump to hire his son in law, yeah, there\u2019s an argument that you can create and it\u2019s an argument that runs against what we have said previously, but we think it\u2019s an argument you can create,\u201d\u00a0Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center\u00a0said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best you can say of this.\" In 1972, Justice advised President Richard Nixon\u2019s counsel that the law bars him from appointing a relative to the \u201cWhite House staff,\u201d and in 1977, the department determined President Jimmy Carter\u00a0could not appoint his wife to serve as chair of his commission on mental health. That same year, it found the president could not appoint his son as an unpaid assistant to a member of his staff. In 1983, the DOJ relied on the first Carter opinion in concluding the anti-nepotism law prohibited the president, Ronald Reagan at the time, from appointing a relative to an advisory committee on private sector initiatives. Most recently, the department ruled the law prevented former President Obama from tapping his half sister and brother-in-law, Maya Soetoro-Ng and her husband Konrad Ng, to serve on advisory committees. The opinion issued Friday said a 1978 law awarded the president the special privileges to hire White House staff \u201cwithout regard to any other provision of law regulating the employment or compensation\u201d of federal employees and so exempts him from the nepotism law, though only within the White House Office. Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, disagrees. She said that law governs other employment factors, but not the actual appointment of an employee, which the nepotism law governs. She said the opinion on Kushner is a reasonable argument but not persuasive, and appears like \u201cresults-oriented lawyering.\u201d \u201cI think that this may be pragmatic lawyering,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThey were trying to find a way to say yes to the now President Trump rather than setting up a fight about something that was really important to President Trump on literally day one or day two of the Trump administration.\u201d Justice officials could not be reached for comment Saturday. Kushner\u2019s lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, said \u201cwe believed that we had the better argument on this. \u201cThe Office of Legal Counsel of the Justice Department \u2014 in an opinion by a highly regarded career Deputy Assistant Attorney General \u2014 adopted a position consistent with our own,\u201d she said in a statement. Earlier this month, Trump said Kushner had been\u00a0a \"tremendous asset and trusted adviser throughout the campaign and transition and I am proud to have him in a key leadership role in my administration... He has been incredibly successful, in both business and now politics.\" Trump said Kushner was \"instrumental in formulating and executing the strategy'' behind the president's November victory. Following his appointment, Kushner said he was \"energized by the shared passion\u00a0of the (president) and the American people.\". 3550 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jKNTsl NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

The march also attracted significant support from celebrities, with actresses Scarlett Johansson and Ashley Judd and singers Alicia Keys and Madonna speaking to the crowd. Performers included Janelle Mona\u00e9, Maxwell and the Indigo Girls. Dr. Trinka Coster, a retired Army colonel, said she was marching because she wants all Americans to get the same \"socialized medicine\" that soldiers and veterans get. \"I'm just glad I retired in July,\" she said of Trump's elevation to commander in chief. Gallery: Pride and Fury: Supporters and Protesters at Trump Inauguration Romaine Mills-Teque, who is African-American, rode down from Boston with her daughter, Brianna. \"I didn't think I'd have to do this for my daughter because my mother and grandmother marched fought for civil rights and women rights for me,\" she said. \"But I will continue to do it until the right is wronged.\" \"It's the most powerful experience I think I've ever had in my life,\" she said, surrounded by thousands of like-minded women. Roschelle Weeks had a similar sentiment. \"I'll remember this. I'll make sure my grandbabies hear about this,\" she said as she nudged her daughter with a laugh. Many marching said they haven't been politically involved in the past, but the nature of this election awakened their civic activism. They said they're concerned about the gender pay gap, access to Planned Parenthood and health care services, and equal rights. \"It made me realize that the things I thought were enough to focus on, which I had been focusing on my life to that point ... were not enough at all,\" said Traci Feit Love, an attorney who started the Lawyers for Good Government Group after the November election.

Now and the future.\" She recognized that Trump might not listen to their message, but added, \"I'm hoping some of the other Republicans might.\" Mark Dunham, of Beacon, New York, held a sign with his wife, Kary, that read, \"Human rights = women's rights.\" The pair cheered on as filmmaker Michael Moore, an outspoken critic of Trump's policies, spoke to the crowd and said the \"old guard of the Democratic Party has to go.\" Mark Dunham, 60, and wife Kary, 50, of Beacon, New York, at the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21, 2017. Corky Siemaszko \"I think it's awesome,\" Kary Dunham, 50, said of the many men also in attendance. \"I didn't doubt there would be so many men. They're not all crazy, misogynist pigs.\" Rose Wurm of Hagerstown, Maryland, said she was determined to show her support in person. The 64-year-old retired medical secretary from Bedford, Pennsylvania, carried two signs. One asked Trump to stop tweeting and the other asked him to fix former President Barack Obama's health care law, rather than get rid of it. Wurm was riding one of the roughly 1,800 buses that had registered to park in Washington on Saturday \u2014 translating to nearly 100,000 people coming for the march just by bus. One company had buses coming from more than 200 cities in 26 states. At New York City's Penn Station, about 200 to 300 women gathered before dawn to board an Amtrak train to the capital. \"If you think we were nasty before, just you wait,\" read one handmade sign, alluding to Trump sniping at rival Hillary Clinton as a \"nasty woman\" during a presidential debate .

Joshua Paul/AP hide caption toggle caption Joshua Paul/AP Timor Leste's Patrick Fabiano, (far left) was one of the 12 players declared ineligible by the Asia Football Confederation disciplinary committee. Joshua Paul/AP The Asian Football Confederation says it found out that a dozen Brazilian-born soccer players playing for East Timor were registered using phony birth or baptism certificates. Now, it has booted the East Timor team out of the 2023 Asian Cup. The players involved in the scheme played in 29 matches, which included World Cup qualifying games. The Football Federation Timor-Leste has been ordered to forfeit those matches and was fined $20,000, with an additional penalty of $56,000 suspended for a probationary period of two years. The probe found that documents for 12 Brazilian-born players were falsified to show that they had at least one parent born in East Timor. The AFC launched the investigation in June, in collaboration with FIFA, the game's governing body. It's not clear whether the players themselves were involved in the document doctoring. FIFA Expands World Cup Format To 48 Teams \"The investigations made no finding regarding the validity of the Timor-Leste citizenship held by those footballers,\" the AFC stated. \"That is a question for the state authorities of Timor-Leste.\" \"East Timor has already been eliminated from the current World Cup, and now faces being expelled from 2022 qualifying in a separate FIFA disciplinary case,\" according to The Associated Press. East Timor is a tiny country with a population of approximately 1.2 million people . The players with fake documents \"helped the nation to its first ever win,\" the BBC reported . It has had a total of five wins in just under 14 years, the broadcaster added. The East Timor national team is sometimes \"jokingly called the Little Samba Nation for its rapid, and sometimes suspect, naturalization of Brazilian players,\" according to The New York Times . Article continues after sponsorship Striker Patrick Fabiano, one of the players with fake documents listed today, told the Times in 2015 that he \"received an invitation from them and they say: 'We give the passport, you play for us.'\" ",

(Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared in the White House briefing room Saturday to deliver a short and combative statement accusing the news media of \"deliberately false reporting\" by\u00a0misrepresenting inaugural crowd sizes and artwork in the Oval Office. Spicer walked away from the podium as reporters asked \u2014 and then shouted \u2014 questions about the women's marches without answering questions. \"Before I get to the news of the day, I think I\u2019d like to discuss some of the coverage of the last 24 hours,\" Spicer told reporters. \"Some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting.\" The new press secretary complained of two issues: \u25ba A tweet by a Time Magazine reporter saying that Trump had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office, replacing it with one of Winston Churchill. But the King bust was simply relocated to another spot in the office. The reporter quickly corrected the error, but the inaccurate information was also distributed to other reporters via a pool report. \"This was irresponsible and reckless,\" Spicer said. \u25ba Crowd estimates of the inaugural. Spicer said photographs were deliberately selected to make the crowds look smaller than they are \u2014 in part because ground coverings used for the first time\u00a0to protect the grass made the empty spots look emptier, he said.\u00a0(Similar ground cover was used on the Mall during President Obama's 2013 inauguration, which was more heavily attended.) \"No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put those out,\" he said. \"This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period, both in person and around the globe,\" he said. \"These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.\" The tone of the statement was noted immediately by observers, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans. \"This is called a statement you're told to make by the president,\" tweeted Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's first press secretary. \"And you know the president is watching.\" \"It is embarrassing, as an American, to watch this briefing by Sean Spicer from the podium at the White House,\" tweeted conservative commentary William Kristol, a leader of the conservative \"Never Trump\" movement. \"Not the RNC. The White House.\" This is called a statement you're told to make by the President.  And you know the President is watching. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 21, 2017 It is embarrassing, as an American, to watch this briefing by Sean Spicer from the podium at the White House. Not the RNC. The White House. \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) January 21, 2017 Spicer spoke as photos of tweets and inaugural crowds appeared on two monitors behind him. He said Trump was warmly received at CIA headquarters during a visit Saturday.\u00a0\"It's a shame that the president\u00a0did not have a CIA director to be there when he visited, because\u00a0Democrats are\u00a0playing politics\u00a0with national security and delaying his confirmation,\" he said. \"That's what you guys should be writing about today.\" It was Spicer's second appearance at the White House podium as press secretary, following an announcement of an executive order Friday night. Spicer also made a number of other announcements Saturday: President Trump will swear in White House aides on Sunday, when they will receive briefings on ethics and the handling of classified information, Spicer said.\u00a0British Prime Minister Theresa May will visit the White House on\u00a0Friday. Trump had spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a-Nieto, with a visit with the Mexican leader scheduled for Jan. 31 to talk ab out trade, immigration and security. It was unclear whether the visit would be in Washington or Mexico City, and the White House did not immediately clarify. Read more: ",

    "text": "Massive women's march in downtown L.A. said to be largest in over a decade Thousands stream into downtown L.A. for women's march Thousands converge on downtown Los Angeles to march for women's rights Thousands converge on downtown Los Angeles to march for women's rights Cindy Chang, Ruben Vives, Dakota Smith, Richard Winton, Christine Zhang Hundreds of thousands of people converged on downtown Los Angeles on Saturday to march for\u00a0women\u2019s rights in\u00a0one of a series of demonstrations taking place across the country. Participants began gathering at Pershing Square as early as 8 a.m., and by 9:30\u00a0protesters had overwhelmed the square and filled surrounding streets. Metro trains into downtown L.A. were jammed with people headed to the march. The exact size of the protest was difficult to measure. Women\u2019s march organizers put the number at 750,000. The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that \u201cwell past\u201d 100,000 people attended\u00a0but did not provide a more precise number. One law enforcement source said officials found it difficult to measure the size because the demonstrators ended up marching down multiple streets. Officials said it appeared to be the largest since a massive 2006 immigration march downtown. The LAPD estimated that march drew 500,000, but organizers insisted the number was higher. Veteran activist\u00a0Jorge Rodriguez, 64, who helped organize the 2006  demonstration, said he thought\u00a0Saturday\u2019s march appeared to be as large as the immigration event if not bigger. Regardless, police said no arrests had been made and that officers were  reopening streets as the crowds began to thin out. The crowd was too large to be accommodated by the planned Hill Street march route. Demonstrators jammed the surrounding streets of Olive, Broadway and Grand Avenue,  chanting \"Love Trumps hate\" as they made their way toward City Hall. \u201cThere is a sea of humanity everywhere,\u201d said Los Angeles police Capt. Andrew Neiman. Aerial footage of the march taken near Grand Park showed an astounding scene, with streets clogged with demonstrators as far as the eye could see, spilling out across the Civic Center.\u00a0 The immense crowd was punctuated by bright pink splashes from hats, scarves, jackets and signs in the traditionally feminine color that has now become a symbol of defiance. Some reported that being in a large crowd of like-minded people was an antidote to the depression they felt on Friday when Donald Trump was inaugurated as president. The march has helped them transform despair into action, they said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a revival of the \u201960s, and I\u2019m going to be a part of it,\u201d said Anna Vastano, 57, a retired social worker. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit back and in 20 years have my grandchildren say, why didn\u2019t I do something.\u201d Vastano\u2019s daughter, Alexandra, said this was her first time at a political protest. The experience, she said, has inspired her to donate money to Planned Parenthood in the name of Vice President Mike Pence, who opposes abortion rights. Alexandra Vastano, 25, who works in health insurance and has a master\u2019s degree in public health, was already thinking about going to law school. Now, she said, studying for the entrance exam has become a high priority because of her determination to fight Trump\u2019s agenda. A group of five friends, most in their early 30s, said they had never joined a protest until Saturday. They said that for them, the march will be the first step toward\u00a0taking action instead of just expressing themselves on Facebook. Sarah Onheiber, 33, an animator, said that as a working mother\u00a0she doesn\u2019t have much time to volunteer, but she now plans to donate money to causes she believes in. She is inspired by her daughter, who is almost 3. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine her not having the same rights I have,\u201d she said. Despite the size of the crowd, officials said the event was proceeding in an orderly fashion and that no major problems were reported. The march began at 10 a.m. under sunny skies and was scheduled to wrap up by 4 p.m. Organizers have emphasized that the march is not simply a protest against the new Trump administration. \u201cWe stand together in solidarity for the protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families \u2014 recognizing that our vibrant and diverse communities are the strength of our country,\u201d the organizers said in their mission statement. \u201cIn the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights, dignity, and justice who have come before us, we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.\u201d \u00a0 Organizers  released a long list of Hollywood heavyweights scheduled to attend, including Natalie Portman, Kerry Washington and Barbra Streisand. The march was led by an all-female motorcycle group called\u00a0the East Side Moto Babes. The engines of the bikes roared along with the cheering crowd. At the head of the march was singer Miley Cyrus . The crowd chanted,\u00a0\"This is what democracy looks like\u201d\u00a0and \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump got to go.\u201d After Metro reported early Saturday that several of its subway and commuter rail stations \u2014 including those in Orange County \u2014\u00a0were jammed and, in some cases, overwhelmed with passengers trying to get to the downtown L.A. march, the transportation authority announced it was adding trains on some of its lines. Many were crowded to capacity, as were stations along the Expo, Blue, Red and Gold lines. Some inner-city bus lines also were packed. Erica Zeitlin said she caught the Expo Line in Santa Monica, but it took nearly an hour before there was a train available with enough space to accommodate more passengers.\u00a0 \u201cMetro could have put on 10\u00a0times as many trains, and they\u2019d be busy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe platforms are packed.\u201d The rail lines were so packed that some Culver City passengers said they had to travel west to Santa Monica before they were able to board a downtown-bound train. Expo Line passenger Angela Duffy said the Culver City station was so packed that she decided to walk to the Palms station. But that station also was crowded, so her group headed to the Santa Monica station. \u201cIt is worth doing it to stand with my fellow women in solidarity,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cChange needs to happen. \u2026 If I just sat at home because I didn\u2019t want to get into the crowds, I would not be standing up for what I believe in.\u201d Brenda Tullo stayed up late crocheting one of the hats for her daughter, Allison, then rose before the sun came up to drive to downtown L.A. from San Bernardino. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the women who came before me, who gave me the privilege to do everything I do today,\u201d said Allison Tullo, 24, who works at a coffee shop. Her aunt and grandmother went to a different women\u2019s march in Ventura. ",

    "text": "A century of women marching on the Mall How the Women\u2019s March compares to other women-led rallies on the Mall May 2000 Comments The Women\u2019s March on Washington drew an estimated crowd of 500,000 to the Mall. The event is the latest in a tradition of civil dissent on the Mall, where women have organized rallies and demonstrations on a wide range of issues for over a century. Crowd size is one way to measure event impact, but crowd estimates are difficult to pin down and can vary widely. Usually, organizer estimates will be larger, while National Park Service and police estimates are smaller. (The National Park Service stopped issuing event estimates in 1995 after controversy surrounding its numbers.) Here we compare ten notable women\u2019s marches since 1913 using the best estimates available. Estimated attendance color key: 1,000 Media estimate 5,000 Historical estimate The day before President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inauguration, around 5,000 women marched on Washington for women\u2019s suffrage. These suffragists were mocked, tripped and even violently attacked by bystanders. But the attacks didn\u2019t stop them from continuing to march. The event would go on to inspire many more marches over the next few years. There were divisions within the movement, though. African American women, including renowned activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, were asked to march in a separate section from their states\u2019 white delegations. Wells-Barnett was among those who refused to oblige. Suffragists march along Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the U.S. Capitol in 1913. (Bain Collection/Library of Congress) January 15, 1968 Organizer(s): Jeannette Rankin; various women's groups Issue(s): Vietnam War Estimated attendance: 5,000 Historical estimate In 1968, 87-year-old Jeannette Rankin led a coalition of women\u2019s groups in a protest against the Vietnam War. Rankin was the first women elected to Congress in 1916 and was a fierce advocate for pacifism, women\u2019s rights and social welfare. The 1968 protest was named in her honor.

The strike focused on women\u2019s rights, including workplace equality and reproductive rights. Betty Friedan, author of \u201cThe Feminine Mystique,\u201d helped plan the protest. The event took place on the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the 19th Amendment, which granted women\u2019s suffrage.

Wade legalized abortion nationally, pro-life activists participated in the first March for Life to protest the Supreme Court decision. Since then, the rally has been held annually on or around the anniversary of Roe v. Wade in late Jan. The event has grown throughout the years. The first march drew a few thousand protestors, while more recent marches have seen consistent crowds estimated to be in the tens to hundreds of thousands.

White) July 9, 1978 March for the Equal Rights Amendment Organizer(s): NOW Issue(s): Women\u2019s rights; Equal Rights Amendment Estimated attendance: 100,000 Media The ultimately doomed Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced to Congress in 1923 in an attempt to guarantee equal rights for women. It was passed by Congress in 1973 but still required ratification by two-thirds of the states within a seven-year time limit. Conservative activists such as Phyllis Schlafly, a lawyer who argued that the ERA would upend traditional gender roles, began a concerted campaign against the amendment. Less than a year before the seven-year ratification time limit, the NOW organized the March for the Equal Rights Amendment to persuade legislators to extend the deadline beyond March 29, 1979. Congress did approve an extension of the time limit to 1982. No other states ratified the amendment, however. In the end, 35 total states ratified the ERA \u2014 three short of the 38 required for the proposed amendment to become law. To this day, there is still no constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women. Leading supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment march in Washington.

Its initial planning was plagued by infighting, but the march\u2019s ultimate success paved the way for this second march. For the second march, organizers, leaders and activists joined together at a National Planning Conference in 1986. A steering committee was put in place, with delegates mandating 25 percent people of color and 50 percent women. The rising awareness of gay people of color and the AIDS epidemic also heavily influenced the planning process and became prominent themes during the protest. Participants of the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights carry a banner as they parade in front of the White House.

Rescuers work in the area of the avalanche-hit Rigopiano Hotel in central Italy on Jan. 21, 2017. (AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The strain showed on Fabio Salzetta's face. The maintenance worker at the luxury Hotel Rigopiano who escaped being buried under the deadly avalanche because he had gone to check the boiler told Italian media Saturday that he called for hours to find survivors, but no one responded. The scene, he said, \"felt like it was a dream. It was a nightmare.\" One of the people buried inside, and among the 23 still missing, is his sister. His voice shaking, he said he last saw her in the kitchen. Five people have been confirmed killed, including two hotel waiters, while nine, including four children who had been on family vacations, have been pulled alive from the reinforced concrete structure buried beneath as many as eight meters of snow last Wednesday. Doctors at the hospital in Pescara said one of the adults underwent surgery for a crushed arm, and was in fair condition, but that all of the other patients were doing well. The children were being moved from intensive care to the pediatric ward. Buoyed by the rescues on Friday, more than two days after the disaster, search crews were intensifying their round-the-clock operation, fighting against the clock and deteriorating weather conditions including fresh snowfall and freezing temperatures. \"The research is difficult also because the site is in a precarious equilibrium, that's why the interventions are made very carefully and why we cannot intervene with big machineries risking to modify a very vulnerable situation,\" said Titti Postiglione of Italy's civil protection agency.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 WASHINGTON \u2013 \u00a0Several hundred thousand people from across the country descended on Washington Saturday to protest Donald Trump just hours into his presidency, donning bright pink hats and carrying a dizzying array of political signs \u2013 in a celebrity-studded march that put the nation\u2019s lingering divisions on full display despite the 45th president\u2019s appeal a day earlier for unity. The protesters, most of whom were women, were largely peaceful by comparison with the scattered bands of rioters who wreaked havoc on parts of D.C. during Friday\u2019s inauguration. This crowd was far larger and more organized. But the march grew more chaotic as the day went on and protesters moved from the National Mall into the streets. And despite indications from some organizers last week that the demonstration was not defined as \u201canti-Trump,\u201d it was in every respect a march against the new president -- kicking off as he attended a National Prayer Service after waking up in the White House for the first time. \u201cA platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday,\u201d actress America\u00a0Ferrera told the crowd Saturday morning on the National Mall. \u201cBut the president is not America. We are America.\u201d Other celebrities including Madonna and Michael Moore stirred up the crowd, with Madonna making perhaps the most inflammatory comments.\u00a0In profanity-laced remarks, the singer said she had \u201cthought an awful lot about blowing up the White House\u201d but knows \u201cthis won\u2019t change anything.\u201d\u00a0 While called the Women's March on Washington, the protest attracted families of men, women and children mostly sporting pro-women and anti-Trump messages.\u00a0Hundreds of \u201csister marches\u201d were held in other cities across the U.S. and internationally.\u00a0 \u201cOf course this is an anti-Trump march,\u201d a local ambassador for the D.C. march, who declined to give his name, said as he directed the crowds toward the rally. \u201cSure, of course it\u2019s for rights, but it\u2019s really against Trump.\u201d Another protester called Trump a \u201cterrible president,\u201d though he has only had the keys to the Oval Office for one day.\u00a0 SLIDESHOW : WOMEN'S MARCH ON WASHINGTON In his inaugural address Friday, Trump spoke in stark terms about America's problems but also called for a \"new national pride\" to heal divisions. Saturday's march showed protesters united -- only in opposition to the new president, on the grounds where just 24 hours earlier, Trump supporters cheered their candidate\u2019s ascension to power.\u00a0 Women wearing \u201cpussy-hats\u201d -- hand-knit pointy-eared pink winter headgear -- held posters with derogatory messages and phrases bashing the president and filled the National Mall.\u00a0 Officials estimated a crowd of 500,000 people, which is more than double what march organizers had predicted. One D.C. official told the Associated Press that the massive turnout also forced organizers to revise plans to march on the White House, and instead head to the nearby ellipse.\u00a0 Children at times held political messages alongside their parents. One family pushed their toddler son through the crowds in a stroller, wearing a sign that read \u201cWho will have a bigger tantrum? Trump or me?\u201d The signs touched on a range of other issues, including statements against controversial oil pipelines, drone warfare, voter ID laws and more. The march, while mostly peaceful, did see isolated incidents, with some women vandalizing portable restrooms designated for the inauguration ceremonies by bashing the locks off with bricks, and some screaming in the faces of a group of people holding signs with Christian messages. \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re not here against Trump, but we\u2019re not here for him either,\u201d one of the sign-holders said. \u201cWe just want to share that God demonstrated his love towards everyone, regardless of what you believe in.\u201d March organizers also had uninvited the group \u201cNew Wave Feminists,\u201d which initially co-sponsored the event, after finding out that the group held a pro-life stance. \u201cIt\u2019s a very specific type of diversity, which does not include everyone,\u201d Founder and President of New Wave Feminists Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Saturday morning. She said despite the lack of invitation, her group still planned to march. \u201cAny time women come together, exciting things happen \u2013 so we definitely wanted to be there with the pro-life contingent.\u201d The movement spread far beyond Washington, as more than 600 \u201csister marches\u201d were planned spanning as far abroad as Myanmar and Australia. In Prague, hundreds gathered in freezing weather; in Copenhagen and Sydney, thousands marched. The D.C. march attracted celebrity participants who took a lead role in pumping up the crowd -- like Ashley Judd, who spoke at a\u00a0morning rally, and Ferrera, who led the artist contingent scheduling appearances and performances from singers Cher and Katy Perry, comedian Amy Schumer, and actresses Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Debra Messing and Patricia Arquette.\u00a0 A day after the inaugural ceremonies, though, Trump supporters were still in town and keeping a presence. Overlooking the National Mall on Saturday were members of the pro-Trump group Bikers for Trump. \u201cI admire a group of like-minded people coming together to march and to demonstrate,\u201d founder Chris Cox said. \u201cBut there are a lot of children out there and a lot of the signs are certainly inappropriate \u2013 I think maybe they should be a little more sensitive to some of their members.\u201d Cox said his group, whose message is to support Trump\u2019s agenda regarding Islamic extremism, support for veterans, and illegal immigration, had several speakers scheduled, but was running late due to the congestion from the Women\u2019s March. The list included bishops and two women whose children were killed by illegal immigrants. Cox condemned the violence that broke out a day earlier. \u201cThey say one thing, and preach and act on another and we don\u2019t condone violence,\u201d Cox told said of his group. \u201cWe\u2019re the blue-collar, working guy, and we have a lot to lose \u2013 we\u2019re not looking for a fight, but hey, we\u2019re not ones to back down from one either.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

(AP Photo/Olmo Calvo) 0 Shares Email Spanish police say migrants have attempted close to 500 illegal border crossings in just one month by trying to hide on passenger and cargo boats landing on its southern coast. Authorities said Saturday they had registered these entry efforts departing from Spain's North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, after a monthlong police operation last year aimed to reduce the number of stowaway migrants setting foot on mainland Spanish ports like Almeria, Malaga and Motril. Increased patrols along both docks and boats yielded almost 500 migrants trying to clandestinely bridge the Strait of Gibraltar , mostly minors dangerously hidden inside trucks, cargo or garbage containers set to be off-loaded into Spain. 0 Shares ",

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo President Donald Trump is joined by the Congressional leadership and his family as he formally signs his cabinet nominations into law, in the President's Room of the Senate, at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017. From left are Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., Donald Trump Jr., Vice President Mike Pence, Jared Kushner, Karen Pence, Ivanka Trump, Barron Trump, Melania Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 0 Shares Email Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, has been approved to work in the Trump administration as an unpaid adviser, the Justice Department announced on Saturday. The early morning memo said that Kushner's appointment would not violate federal anti-nepotism laws, despite concerns about ethical gray areas. \u201cWe conclude that section 3110 [of the U.S. Code] does not bar this appointment,\u201d according to the 14-page memo from the Justice Department. \"We believe that the President\u2019s special hiring authority in 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a) permits him to make appointments to the White House Office that the anti-nepotism statute might otherwise forbid.\" Public officials cannot appoint, employ or advocate for family members for roles in their administrations. The laws, however, apply specifically to government agencies, like the Department of Homeland Security or the Treasury. Kushner\u2019s role as an adviser within the White House would not fall into this category. Application of the Anti-Nepotism Statute to a Presidential Appointment in the White House Office According to Josh Chafetz, a professor at Cornell Law School and an expert in constitutional law and legislative procedure, the White House is not regulated in the same way as other administrative agencies. \u201cThe bigger issue for the administration is not so much about the technical bounds of these nepotism laws, but it just looks bad,\u201d Chafetz said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything legal that can be done in terms of the appointment. It just looks like there\u2019s a pattern of cronyism that has emerged, especially in conjunction with the cabinet appointments.\u201d The anti-nepotism laws were originally passed in response to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s appointment of his brother Robert as attorney general. They later prevented President Jimmy Carter from hiring his son as a White House intern during his administration. For presidential advisers without explicit roles, there are no legal restrictions. When family members serve specific roles, however, it becomes more complicated. Hillary Clinton, for example, famously went to D.C. Circuit Court in 1993 for her appointment to President Bill Clinton\u2019s Task Force on National Health Care Reform. The court ruled that the White House and the Executive Office of the President were not subject to the anti-nepotism laws because they were not technically agencies. Kushner, who has an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion, will forgo a salary in his new role. He is subject, however, to conflict of interest laws that do not apply to the president. Kushner owns the New York Observer as well as investment fund Kushner Companies, and has promised to resign and cut ties with his business empire. He will \"divest substantial assets\" by selling them or placing them into trusts held by family members, and \"abide by federal rules requiring impartiality,\" according to a statement released by Jamie Gorelick, his attorney and partner at law firm WilmerHale. The president has previously expressed interest in having his son-in-law work on issues involving the Middle East, praising him as a \"tremendous asset.\" Already working within his new role, Kushner was photographed in the oval office Friday night as Trump signed the first executive order of his presidency. \"He has been incredibly successful, in both business and now politics,\" the president said of Kushner in a release earlier this month announcing the new role. \"He will be an invaluable member of my team.\" ",

The rift widened notably when Trump, while still president-elect, questioned intelligence reports that said Russia tried to influence the November election in his favor, and then openly antagonized the intelligence community on Twitter. Earlier this month, however, he publicly accepted the U.S. intelligence agencies' findings that Russia was involved in cyberespionage. Trump blamed the media Saturday for claiming that he was sparring with intelligence officials. \"They made it seem like I had a feud with the intelligence community, and the reason you're the No. 1 stop is exactly the opposite,\" Trump told CIA officers and staff in attendance. The \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 He noted earlier, however, that the agency didn't seem to be getting the support that it should have. \"I am so behind you, and I know that maybe you haven't gotten the backing that you've wanted,\" Trump said. \"You're going to get so much backing ... You'll say, 'Please, Mr. President, please don't give us so much backing.'\" Related: In Inaugural Address, Trump Pledges to Keep 'America First' Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn joined Trump at the CIA, along with Trump's choice for CIA director, Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan. Pompeo's nomination remains locked up in the Senate confirmation process as Democrats say they need more time to debate before a confirmation vote can be held. Trump earlier in the day attended a prayer breakfast at the Washington National Cathedral \u2014 as is tradition on the day after the inauguration \u2014 just as tens of thousands of demonstrators flooded D.C to support gender equality and other issues at the Women's March on Washington.

Costello, for USA TODAY) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 More than 2 million people across the world, led by hundreds of thousands who overwhelmed the nation's capital, protested the first full day of President Trump's tenure Saturday. What began as a Facebook post by a Hawaii grandmother the day after Hillary Clinton's loss in November's election \u00a0blossomed into a massive protest uniting people of all ages, races and religions\u00a0who crowded downtown Washington. They called for a \"revolution\" as a bulwark against \u00a0the new administration and the Republican-led Congress they fear will roll back reproductive, civil and human rights. A five-hour rally featured speakers ranging from Ilyasah Shabazz, a daughter of Malcom X, to Sister Simone Campbell, a Catholic nun, and the music superstar Madonna. People arrived in buses or flew across country from locales as far as California to bring\u00a0the main arteries of downtown Washington to a near standstill. While the event's organizers sought to highlight many concerns, including climate change and criminal justice reform, the speakers were united in imploring the crowd to begin taking\u00a0action by donating to progressive causes and even running for public office once they return home. \"Once it happens in a generation that a spirit of resistance is awakened,\" said Rabbi Sharon Brous. \"This is one of those moments. Our children will one day ask us \u2018where were you when our country was thrust into a lion\u2019s den of demagoguery and division,'\" she said. CLOSE x Share America Ferrerra, speaking at the Women's March on Washington, lists reasons for the protest are for the \"moral core of this nation.\" USA TODAY NETWORK \"The revolution starts here,\" said Madonna. \"It is the beginning of much-needed change,\" but, \"change that will require sacrifice, people, change that will require many of us to make different choices in our lives. But this is the hallmark of revolution. So my question to you today is, are you ready?\" said Madonna, before entertaining the crowd with her 1988 hit song \"Express Yourself.\" According to a sister march webpage, an estimated 2.6 million people took part in 673\u00a0marches in all 50 states and 32 countries, from Belarus to New Zealand \u2014 with the largest taking place in Washington. The crowds were so large in some cities\u00a0that marching was almost impossible. In Chicago, organizers halted the march and rallied at Grant Park instead as crowds swelled to 150,000, although thousands still marched. In New York City, the number was 200,000; in Boston, media reported more than 100,000 people marching in Boston Common.\u00a0In Oakland, Calif., police estimated that about 60,000 people took part in the women's march.\u00a0San Francisco\u2019s rally began at 3\u00a0pm local time, with a march at 5 pm. It was the first time Kristen Phillip of San Mateo, Calif. had\u00a0attended a march. \u00a0\"I'm 44 and I've never done anything like this but I feel compelled to be here,\" she said.\u00a0She brought her 24-year old daughter Claire who said the San Francisco rally made her feel \"powerful and hopeful.\" \"It makes me feel that we can get through this, if we love each other and don't let them divide us,\" she said. CLOSE x Share More than 2 million people across the world, led by hundreds of thousands who overwhelmed the nation's capital, protested the first full day of President Trump's tenure Saturday. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY Peter Monks of San Francisco, who attended\u00a0with his wife and daughters, said he was showing support for women's issues \"to a president who doesn't seem to recognize or care about them.\" \"As a white guy, it's easy to take privilege for granted,\" Monks said. \"It feels really important to stand up for civil society when powerful voices are lined up against it.\" In D.C., the huge crowds come\u00a0a day after empty space was spotted on the National Mall ahead of Trump's inauguration speech and bare bleachers were noticeable along the inaugural parade route. \"When you go back home, remember\u00a0how you felt, that instant, that gut, that\u00a0said 'I gotta get on a bus, a train a plane,\" said Tamika Mallory, a civil rights activist and march\u00a0co-chair. \"Be bold in the way you were bold to come here in such large numbers,\" \u00a0Mallory. said \"It\u2019s about you going home after today and standing up and fighting in our communities,\" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. \"Take it home.\" \"This is an outpouring of energy and true democracy like I have never seen in my very long life,\" said feminist icon Gloria Steinem. On Saturday morning, a DC official said, according to organizers, the turnout estimate had grown to\u00a0500,000 \u2014 more than double the 200,000 people that organizers initially expected to attend. Given the turnout, the march will probably take its\u00a0place\u00a0among historic demonstrations\u00a0\u2014 including the 1963 civil rights demonstrations and the Vietnam War protests of 1967. Attendees weren't organized by a single group. They came on their own, many aboard overnight charter buses, for what Crystal Hoyt, an associate dean at the University of Richmond, called \"one of the largest and most significant demonstrations for social justice in America\u2019s 240-year history.\" Posted!

AP hide caption toggle caption AP Authorities escort Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman to a waiting caravan of SUVs at Long Island MacArthur Airport on Thursday in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. AP For decades, U.S. authorities have been preparing to prosecute one of the world's most feared drug traffickers, known as El Chapo. Friday, the Justice Department announced charges against Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman following his extradition from Mexico to the United States. He landed Thursday evening on Long Island, N.Y., and Friday afternoon entered a plea of not guilty at a federal court in Brooklyn. \"Today marks a milestone in our pursuit of Chapo Guzman,\" said Robert Capers, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. \"So who is Chapo Guzman? In short, he's a man known for no other life than a life of crime, violence, death and destruction. And now he'll have to answer to that. That's who Chapo Guzman is.\" The Associated Press described the scene: \"Holding his unshackled hands behind his back, Guzman appeared calm and collected as he gave yes and no answers, through an interpreter, to a judge's questions.\" Article continues after sponsorship Interview With 'El Chapo' Draws Backlash From Mexican Journalists In a statement, acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates called him the \"alleged leader of a multi-billion dollar, multi-national criminal enterprise that funneled drugs onto our streets and violence and misery into our communities.\" Prosecutors are seeking life in prison and a $14 billion forfeiture in drug proceeds and illicit profits from the drug trafficking kingpin. The 17-count indictment accuses El Chapo of operating a continuing criminal enterprise that included murder conspiracy, other drug-related crimes including money-laundering, and use of firearms. \"As part of the extradition process, we had to assure the Mexican government that the death penalty would not be sought,\" Capers said. The allegations date to the 1980s. Guzman, 59, is accused of leading the Sinaloa drug cartel, which became the world's largest drug trafficking organization. The indictment alleges that Guzman \"directed a large scale narcotics transportation network involving the use of land, air and sea transportation assets, shipping multi-ton quantities of cocaine from South America, through Central America and Mexico, and finally into the United States.\" The billions in profits were then \"laundered back to Mexico,\" according to the court documents. Guzman, along with other cartel leaders, allegedly hired hit men \"who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, assaults, kidnappings, and acts of torture at the direction of the defendants.\" The Mexican government has approved the U.S. request to prosecute these charges, which were filed in a federal court in New York, the Justice Department added. As NPR's Carrie Kahn reports from Mexico City : \"Mexico had at one point said it would not extradite Guzman and would have him stand trial for his crimes at home. That was shortly after a second arrest in 2014. But the government reversed itself after being embarrassed by Guzman's brazen escape from Mexico's maximum security prison in the summer of 2015. \"From a hole that began [in the shower floor] in Guzman's prison cell, the drug lord climbed down a ladder and then rode a rigged motorcycle through a mile-long tunnel to freedom. Guzman remained on the run for nearly six months. During that time, he met secretly with Mexican actress Kate del Castillo and U.S. actor Sean Penn. \"Shortly after, though, and partly due to his meeting with the stars, Mexican officials caught up with Guzman, capturing him in January of last year. This time officials immediately began extradition procedures. Guzman's lawyers have been fighting it ever since. He lost his final appeal this week.\" El Chapo has eluded law enforcement for decades, as William F. Sweeney, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office, told reporters. U.S. officials vowed that Guzman won't escape again. \"He's about to face American justice. ... And I assure you, no tunnel will be built leading to his bathroom,\" said Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of ICE Homeland Security Investigations in New York City NPR correspondent Joel Rose in New York contributed to this report.

The city of Hattiesburg said via its Twitter account that four people had died after the twister blew through the city and surrounding area. The twister was part of a wall of stormy weather traveling across the region, bringing with it rain and unstable conditions. Mayor Johnny DuPree has signed an emergency declaration for the city, which reported \u201csignificant injuries\u201d and structural damage. The city also said via Twitter that Hattiesburg firefighters and police are going door-to-door to try to rescue victims. Greg Flynn of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said rescuers are still searching the stricken area for more possible victims. Flynn said \u201cmassive damage\u201d was reported in a three-county area that was struck by a tornado at around 4 a.m. Photos and television images showed the intensity of the damage. Cars were flipped over, sometimes piled on top of each other while parts of houses were ripped into shards of wood and debris. Once tall trees were ripped from their roots and thrown across roads. As dawn rose over the city, rescue workers and residents walked down streets strewn with debris and still wet from the storm. The three counties affected are Forrest, Lamar and Perry counties. Flash flood warnings were also in effect for northern Forrest and Lamar counties, as well as southeastern Jones and Marion counties. The National Weather Service said three to five inches of rain have already fallen, raising the risk of flooding. More rain - one to two inches - is possible. The Mississippi Highway Patrol is reporting Interstate 59 north of Hattiesburg is closed due to debris. Downed power lines and debris have been reported over a wide area. A reporter with CBS Hattiesburg affiliate WHLT-TV tweeted that multiple power line poles were down on state Highway 49.

The department\u2019s National Park Service apologized for the retweets in a post today. \"We regret the mistaken RTS,\" the National Park Service said. We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you pic.twitter.com/mctNNvlrmv \u2014 NationalParkService (@NatlParkService) January 21, 2017 A spokesman for the National Park Service told the Washington Post in an email that the retweeting was \u201cinconsistent with the agency\u2019s approach to engaging the public through social media.\u201d \u201cThe Department of Interior\u2019s communications team determined that it was important to stand down Twitter activity across the Department temporarily, except in the case of public safety,\u201d Thomas Crosson, the spokesman, said in an email. The first retweet linked to an Esquire article pointing out that the official White House website had removed policy pages on climate change, civil rights and health care. The second retweet was a side-by-side photo comparison of the size of Trump's inauguration crowd compared to Obama's inauguration crowd in 2009 that had been originally tweeted by a New York Times reporter. The National Park Service does not release official crowd estimates for permitted events. Trump Posts Vow to Scrap Climate Action Plan on White House Website Both retweets were removed from the National Park Service's Twitter account and the agency announced to employees that they were temporarily suspended for the most part from posting to the main Twitter account. According to the Washington Post , an email was sent out Friday that directed all bureaus and the department to shut down Twitter platforms \"immediately upon further notice.\" The email urging the shutdown was sent by an Interior Department career official, not a new White House staffer or someone from the Trump transition team, according to an Interior Department official. \"Out of an abundance of caution, while we investigated the situation involving these tweets, the Department's communications team determined that it was important to stand down Twitter activity across the Department temporarily, except in the case of public safety,\" the statement from an Interior Department official said. The statement confirmed that the various Twitter accounts for its 10 bureaus will resume as normal. \"Now that social media guidance has been clarified, the Department and its bureaus should resume Twitter engagement as normal this weekend,\" the statement read. \"With the exception of social media posts on the Secretary's policy priorities, which will be outlined upon confirmation.\" ABC News was not able to independently confirm the email. Trump's nominee for interior secretary, Rep. Ryan Zinke, will testify in his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. ABC News' Karen Travers contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Solis / AP Shanise McMorris grieves on the slab of her Hattiesburg, Miss. home after an early tornado hit the city on Jan. 21, 2017.\u00a0 Shanise McMorris grieves on the slab of her Hattiesburg, Miss. home after an early tornado hit the city on Jan. 21, 2017.\u00a0 (Rogelio V. Solis / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Rain was pouring down in the pre-dawn darkness, and the wind was picking up as Darryl McMorris ran for his daughters' bedroom. The windows started blowing out as he dove on top of his girls, grabbing one under each arm as he tried to protect them. \"As soon as I did that it seemed like we were flying in the air,\" he recalled Saturday. Walls began to collapse and the house began to blow apart as his daughters screamed. But he held on tight. When the tornado finished ripping its way through their Hattiesburg home he and the two girls were under a wall. Their house appears to be a total loss, bedding tossed 50 feet into a tree and their oldest daughter asking, \"Is God mad at us?\" But they're alive. \"I don't see how we survived this,\" said his fiancee Shanise. Across the tornado's devastating path, families were taking stock of the damage, hugging friends and neighbors, grieving over the remains of their homes and in many cases mourning those killed. Authorities said four people died when the twister touched down around 3:35 a.m. Saturday. Shannon Hefferan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service , says damage reports indicate it touched down in Lamar County before ripping into Forrest County and skirting just south of downtown Hattiesburg \u2014 the state's fourth largest city.

Solis / AP) The tornado continued across the Leaf River into neighboring Petal. Emergency management officials said the severe weather also damaged Perry and Jones counties. Teams are out assessing the damage. Already they know that the tornado was accompanied by a deluge of rain \u2014 3.42 inches over a six to seven hour period Saturday morning \u2014 Hefferan said. And the bad weather isn't over yet. The weather service anticipates another round Saturday night. A tornado watch was already in effect until 9 p.m. in parts of southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, warning that hail, gusting winds and tornadoes are possible. Forrest County Coroner Butch Benedict on Saturday afternoon released the names of the dead: Earnest Perkins, 58; Cleveland Madison, 20; David Wayne McCoy, 47 and Simona Cox, 72. Monica McCarty lost her father \u2014 Perkins \u2014 who died in the same trailer park where she and her boyfriend live and her son \u2014 Madison \u2014 who was apparently crushed to death while in bed at her mother's house where he lived. Standing amid the tornado's carnage, McCarty wept as her boyfriend, Tackeem Molley, comforted her. \"They couldn't get him out of the house. They said he was lying in the bed,\" McCarty said of her son. Molley said he and McCarty were in a trailer when the storm hit. Molley, whose bare foot was bandaged, said he climbed out through a hole in what had either been the trailer's roof or wall. \"I had a little hole I could squeeze out of,\" he said. In the surrounding neighborhood, power company trucks ran up and down the streets and city backhoe plowed debris from the road. Dozens of homes were damaged. Sheet metal was strewn everywhere. Trees turned into spindly sticks were lying across power lines. At least three nearby churches had sustained damage. Mayor Johnny DuPree has signed an emergency declaration for the city, which reported \"significant injuries\" and structural damage. Greg Flynn of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said \"massive damage\" was reported. At least 50 people have been treated for injuries at two area hospitals, he said. Gov. Phil Bryant visited the damaged areas Saturday. Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney says insured damaged is likely to top $200 million. \"You've got so many buildings that are for all practical purposes totally destroyed,\" said Andy Case, a disaster recovery specialist with the Department of Insurance. Emergency management officials reported 16,000 customers were without power as power companies rushed to restore electricity where damage allowed. At William Carey University, a Baptist institution south of downtown Hattiesburg, almost every building on campus suffered at least superficial damage. Many were heavily damaged. College officials closed the campus where 3,200 students study and 800 students live and are not sure when it will reopen. Saturday afternoon parents and students streamed onto campus to remove belongings from damaged dorms with some students making their way over shattered glass or around fallen bricks to reach their room. For students in their dorms when the tornado struck, it was terrifying. Tegan Sager, a freshman from Hermiston, Oregon, said she'd never been in a tornado before. She said bursts of lightening lit up the outside just before the tornado hit. She and 20 other students huddled in the first floor hallway of their dorm, cradling their heads in the hands. \"That's when the panels from the roof were falling in,\" she said. \"Girls were screaming and a person next to me got cut on the leg.\" In many areas the roar of chain saws could be heard as people began cutting down trees, salvaging belongings and considering their next steps. As the McMorris family gathered at a parking lot of a ruined gas station across the street from their house, they took stock of their losses and what had been saved. \"I lost everything but I'm just glad I didn't lose my daughters,\" McMorris said.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic Yet women did not protest \u2014 or vote \u2014 as a bloc. About 53 percent of white women voted for Mr. Trump, according to exit polls, and many said his demeaning comments about women mattered less to them than their belief that he had the independence, temperament and business experience to bring about change, restore well-paying jobs and protect America\u2019s borders. The marches came a day after confrontations between anti-Trump protesters and the police led to more than 200 arrests in Washington. But Saturday\u2019s demonstrations were peaceful, and counterprotests were few. In St. Paul, one man was arrested after marchers reported he had \u201csprayed irritants\u201d into the crowd, the police said. By midafternoon, the target of the protests had not said anything about the marchers, verbally or on Twitter. Though the Washington march ended within sight of the White House, and some demonstrators passed by his recently-opened hotel, Mr. Trump did not cross paths with the crowd. After attending the inauguration on Friday, Mrs. Clinton was not seen at the march, which had strong echoes of her campaign appearances, including some of the same celebrities, performers and slogans. She did, however, acknowledge the moment on Twitter. \u201cThanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch,\u201d she wrote. \u201cImportant as ever. I truly believe we\u2019re always Stronger Together.\u201d Thanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch . Important as ever. I truly believe we're always Stronger Together. \u2014         Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) Jan. 21, 2017 The marches captured the potential and the perils for the progressive movement \u2014 whether it can frame its message to appeal to new generations and whether it can translate protests into action locally and nationally. Photo A woman wore a United States flag as a hijab during a protest in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Credit Gregor Fischer/DPA, via Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Plans for Saturday\u2019s march in Washington began as Facebook posts just after the election by a retired lawyer in Hawaii and a fashion designer in New York, both of whom are white and had no experience organizing protests. Soon, protests flooded the feeds urging them to diversify. In the end, a triumvirate of African-American, Latina and Muslim women assumed leadership . Advertisement Continue reading the main story The march\u2019s initial struggles echoed broader debates in the movement about whether the courting of new demographic groups alienated the white working-class voters who had carried Mr. Trump to victory, or whether white women had betrayed gender solidarity by voting for him. Yet on Saturday, these tensions did not deter a multiracial, multigenerational turnout at the marches. Mothers marched with daughters and granddaughters; whole families, including husbands and sons, marched arm in arm. One extended family that gathered in Washington was inspired by its 100-year-old matriarch, Sylvia Fein, who at the last minute decided that it would be too physically daunting for her to march. \u201cI\u2019ve been voting for president since F.D.R. and I don\u2019t remember ever feeling this way about a person,\u201d said Ms. Fein, a retired accountant and painter in Philadelphia. Photo In a sly allusion to crude remarks made by Mr. Trump about sexual assault, many marchers wore hats sporting cat ears. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Her grandniece, Mikhael Tara Garver, 37, who traveled to the march from Brooklyn, recalled how her family had reacted after the election: \u201cWe were all calling my great-aunts, because we all knew how important Hillary was to them and how important surviving to see that moment was for them.\u201d Another family came from Baltimore, sisters, daughters and in-laws alike. \u201cWe have to get away from fear,\u201d said Lureen Grace Wiggins, 49. Her daughter, Eden, 17, was exhilarated by the size of the crowd: \u201cWhen you\u2019re out here and people see you, they know you care.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The march was rich in historical allusions \u2014 most deliberately, the 1963 march led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But it echoed many other marches as well, including those in the 1970s that brought hundreds of thousands of women to the streets championing an Equal Rights Amendment that was ultimately defeated, and those from the late 1990s on for abortion rights, culminating in a 2004 March for Women\u2019s Lives that organizers said drew more than one million to the capital. Saturday\u2019s march happened to come just six days before quite a different one: the annual March for Life by opponents of abortion. But perhaps the most apt analogy, said Ellen Fitzgerald, the author of \u201cThe Highest Glass Ceiling,\u201d was to the 1913 suffragists\u2019 march on Washington, timed to coincide with the inauguration of President Woodrow Wilson. Led by the renowned suffragist Alice Paul, it featured a lawyer, Inez Milholland, riding a white horse down Pennsylvania Avenue, 24 floats, nine marching bands and even luminaries like Helen Keller. The women were hooted, jeered and roughed up by the police, generating congressional hearings and public sympathy. They won the vote seven years later. Faye Wattleton, the former president of Planned Parenthood, said that women had always had to regroup, even after they thought battles were won. \u201cThis is not new,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to go back to the battlefield and re-fight the wars against women.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Farah Stockman from Washington, Julie Turkewitz from Denver, Jess Bidgood from Boston, Emma G. Fitzsimmons from New York, Mitch Smith from Chicago, Christina Capecchi from St. Paul and Jennifer Medina from Los Angeles.

Sean Spicer in his first briefing since the inauguration also warned the media that \"we're going to hold the press accountable\" and said Trump doesn't need the press. \"As long as he serves as the messenger for this incredible movement he will take his message directly to the American people, where his focus will always be,\" Spicer said. Related: Women's March Brings Flood of Pink Hats, Fiery Rhetoric to Washington Spicer, who did not take questions from reporters, spent much of his statement condemning a photo and the reporting around it showing big gaps in the crowds on the National Mall on Inauguration Day. He said white floor coverings to protect the grass \"had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.\" He claimed the tweeted photo was \"intentionally framed\" to be misleading.

The size of the crowd Friday is unclear because the National Park Service, which controls the mall, no longer releases official estimates of crowd sizes. \"These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\" Spicer said. The Park Service said the coverings are translucent decking to protect the National Mall turf, part of a five-year, $40 million project that was completed in 2016. Related: Trump Visits CIA, Says 'I Am So Behind You' Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, suggested in a Tweet that the strong push back against the crowd size reporting was coming from the top. \"This is called a statement you're told to make by the President. And you know the President is watching,\" Fleischer said on Twitter. In a Saturday visit to the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump also complained about reports on the crowd size and called the media \"dishonest.\" He was criticized by some for the remarks. Former CIA Director John Brennan through a spokesman called the speech, given in front of a memorial wall honoring agency employees who died in the line of service, \"a despicable display of self-aggrandizement.\" \"Former CIA Director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself,\" Nick Shapiro, former deputy chief of staff under Brennan said. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, attacked Trump's public remarks during his CIA visit for giving \"little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment\" of staffers who have lost their lives on the job. Spicer said Trump \"delivered them a powerful and important message: He told them he has their back, and they were grateful for that.\" An official press briefing will be held Monday. Spicer also said Trump has spoken with Canadian prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who will visit on Oct. 31. British Prime Minister Theresa May will also visit the White House, Spicer said. Phil Helsel ",

Mere minutes after the news broke that the Colts had fired the general manager, McAfee tweeted \"Thank God.\" The tweet would have been a bit cryptic\u00a0had he not followed it up with: \" 'Unwarranted Arrogance' just ran into a brick wall called karma.\" And after local radio personality Dan Dakich\u00a0tweeted , \"So funny.. the Punter,\" McAfee responded with\u00a0\"All Pro punter\" please and thank you.. also someone who has seen your best friend treat humans absolutely horrendously for 5 years.\" IndyStar Colts Insider Stephen Holder later added , \"I am not taking a position here. Just passing along facts. Ryan Grigson was absolutely despised by many people in the building.\" McAfee wasn't alone: \u2014 Jerrell Freeman (@JerrellFreeman) January 21, 2017 Now we can play ball....! \u270c pic.twitter.com/su0Qo8SMpC \u2014 Reggie Wayne (@ReggieWayne_17) January 21, 2017 Great move by the colts...

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 21, 2017 8:08 AM EST SEATTLE -- Police said a suspect was in custody early Saturday after a man was shot and critically wounded in Seattle as protests against the inauguration of President Trump turned violent. Seattle Police said they removed a 32-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the abdomen at a University of Washington demonstration Friday night against a far-right commentator who was making an appearance on campus. People in Seattle marching against Mr. Trump had just walked to the campus where the rally against Milo Yiannopoulos was taking place Friday evening. Yiannopoulos writes for right-wing Breitbart News and is known for leading a harassment campaign that resulted in a lifetime ban from Twitter. Protests break out in Oregon Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg said the man who was shot arrived at the hospital at 9 p.m. and that he was in surgery and in critical condition. The Seattle Police Department released a statement early Saturday saying a person of interest in the shooting had turned himself in to University of Washington police. University police said in its own statement that a suspect was taken into custody and that there were no outstanding suspects. No other details were immediately released. View Gallery A Seattle Police officer is pictured near an ambulance where one person was shot at the University of Washington, where protesters arrived outside a speaking engagement by Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulosin in Seattle, Washington, Jan. 20, 2017. Reuters/Jason Redmond In Portland, Oregon, police used \u201cflash-bang\u201d grenades and tear gas Friday night to disperse a rowdy crowd. Authorities said some people in the crowd - that at one point numbered in the thousands - threw rocks, bottles, flares and \u201cunknown liquid\u201d at officers. The city\u2019s entertainment district was closed following the incident. By about 9:25 p.m. the crowd dwindled to about few dozen around the city\u2019s Pioneer Courthouse Square, where earlier a small group of protesters burned American flags. 57 Photos Trump inauguration protests At first the flag burners, many of them masked and clad in black, had trouble because of the rain, but using lighter fluid they torched at least half a dozen flags. An ember briefly fell on the jacket of one participant but the fire was quickly put out. The crowd in Portland then marched through downtown. Later, police announced the protest had become unlawful after some were seen armed with clubs and sticks and were throwing unknown liquid at officers. Police said five people were arrested during the evening protests in Portland. Earlier in the day, police arrested another man who was wanted in connection with a November protest-turned-riot. When Billy Ellison, 18, was arrested he had a torch, knife and gas mask, police said. Dozens of groups in Washington protest Trump's inauguration He was booked into jail on two counts of interfering with public transportation. Earlier in Seattle, protesters from Capitol Hill and Central District neighborhoods streamed downtown for an afternoon immigrant and refugee rights rally. Carrying signs that said \u201cFight Racism & Sexism\u201d and \u201cResist Trump,\u201d people from the earlier rallies met at Westlake Park downtown Friday afternoon. People rallied and listened to speeches before resuming a march Friday evening, blocking traffic in some downtown areas. Seattle officers at the park had confiscated wooden poles, heavy pipes and hammers, Seattle police said on Twitter. Violent protests break out after Trump sworn in About 200 protesters gathered on the Capitol steps in Olympia, carrying signs that included \u201cResist Trump\u201d and \u201cNot My President.\u201d Later Olympia police reported that about 100 people marched through downtown, causing some traffic disruptions. In Portland, there was a student walkout at Portland State University a couple of hours before the flag-burning. Loren Ford and his wife, Judy Arter, stood watch with a sign that read \u201cImpeach Trump.\u201d The couple traveled to Portland from the small town of Lebanon, Oregon, to protest because they felt Mr. Trump was not fit for office due to conflicts of interest and his rejection of intelligence community reports that Russia had been involved in influencing the election. \u201cI think he needs to be investigated right off the bat,\u201d Ford said. 91 Photos Inauguration of Donald Trump Patricia Elliott, of Portland, said she felt compelled to attend the march and could not bring herself to watch the inauguration earlier on TV. \u201cI\u2019d feel like I was saluting to fascism, for example, and I don\u2019t want to participate in that at all.\u201d she said. Some businesses in Portland\u2019s downtown announced they would close early because of the anticipated crowds. Owners of some establishments boarded up windows to prevent damage. Portland protests after Mr. Trump\u2019s election last November turned violent when a small group of demonstrators smashed windows, spray-painted buildings and started small fires. The demonstration caused about $1 million in damage, police have said. The organizer of the Friday protest said he met with newly elected Mayor Ted Wheeler to discuss how to keep the rally peaceful. The event\u2019s goal was aimed at Mr. Trump and at putting pressure on local elected officials to make Portland \u201ca sanctuary city, not just in the immigration sense of the word, but in every sense of the word,\u201d said Gregory McKelvey. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have had a meeting with the mayor if I couldn\u2019t put 10,000 people in the streets,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Time Gloria Steinem, center right, greets protesters at the barricades before speaking at the Women's March on Washington. (Photo: John Minchillo/AP) CHICAGO \u2014 In Grant Park, tens of thousands gathered for a rally that grew so large that organizers had to halt the\u00a0planned short march through the city's downtown. Unseasonably warm weather appeared to help bolster attendance. The Chicago Transit Authority added extra cars to the city's L train service to help transport the mass of people. Still, the trains were packed to the gills. Organizers, who projected more than 50,000 demonstrators, said the crowd appeared to have swelled to 150,000. It was held on the same site that former President Barack Obama used for his 2008 Election Night victory party. More coverage: Celebrities flock to D.C. for the march \"Our march route is flooded. There is no safe way to march. We are just going to sing and dance and make our voices heard here,\" rally and march co-chairwoman Ann Scholhmer told the crowd at Jackson and Columbus drives just before 11 a.m., according to the Chicago Tribune . Still, thousands did march through the downtown streets. Similar women's marches are drawing huge crowds across the country, including the hallmark event in Washington, D.C., and others in Boston, New York City and Miami. In Chicago, Kris Grady, 49, came with a group of friends from the nearby suburb of Western Springs. Grady, whose husband is disabled, said she is concerned about what Trump's presidency will mean for\u00a0health care for her husband\u00a0and her two daughters. She said\u00a0she couldn't even stomach watching Trump's inaugural speech. Still, she said she's hopeful the marches around the globe Saturday marked the rising of a powerful resistance against Trump. \"It's tragic that we've made so much progress in accepting diversity and encouraging it,\" Grady said of Trump's election. \"There may not be a linear shot to all we want to accomplish today, but it's important that we make our voices heard. What this is about is that over time with our persistence and insistence and getting active at every level, I think this will make a difference.\" Selva Urzagaste, 26, an immigrant from Bolivia who moved to Chicago when she was a child, said the rise of Trump has felt like an assault on her identity. She said she was demonstrating to speak up for herself and to show solidarity with others who are feeling marginalized by Trump's rhetoric. \"Growing up, there was a stigma about speaking Spanish and not being from here,\" said Urzagaste, who held a sign quoting the activist Malala \"I am stronger than fear.\" \"You want to feel American for so long. And I finally reached a point where I felt good about myself \u2014 and feel like an American. Now I feel like, 'Do I want to be part of all this hatred? \"Ultimately I do, \" she added. \"Our generation is strong, and as long as we don't forget how far we've come, we'll get there.\" Posted!

    "text": "Senate Confirms Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security By ALI ROGIN Jan 20, 2017, 8:06 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Sworn In as President of the United States 0 Shares Email The Senate confirmed two of President Donald Trump 's cabinet nominees Friday just hours after his swearing in, and scheduled a third confirmation vote next Monday. In a 98-1 vote, the Senate confirmed retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis as Trump's secretary of Defense, with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , D-New York, opposing his nomination and Sen. Jeff Sessions , R-Alabama, Trump's pick for attorney general, not voting. Later Friday evening, the Senate also approved Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security in a vote of 88-11. Trump, in his first White House statement, said he was \"pleased\" by the confirmation votes on the two top national security positions. \"These uniquely qualified leaders will immediately begin the important work of rebuilding our military, defending our nation and securing our borders. I am proud to have these two American heroes join my administration,\" he said. Eight years ago, the Senate cleared seven of President Obama's nominees on his first day in office, and 13 by the end of the first week. The votes on Trump's national security team came as a trio of Senate Democrats threatened to hold up a confirmation vote on Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, Trump's pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. As top congressional leaders mingled at a lunch shortly after Trump's swearing in, top Senate Republicans and Democrats were still wrangling over when to bring Pompeo's nomination to the Senate floor. Sens. Ron Wyden , D-Oregon, Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut and Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont, demanded more time to debate Pompeo's nomination. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Donald Trump's Defense Secretary Gen. James Mattis (C) arrives on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2017 in Washington, DC. He was the first Trump Cabinet nominee confirmed by the Senate today, with a 98-1 vote. Republicans chafed at Democrats' comments on the first day of a new administration. \"Why the hell can't we just go ahead and give the president his national security team?\" said Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona, on the Senate floor. The Senate will hold additional debate and vote on Pompeo's confirmation Monday, after holding a procedural vote today. The Senate cleared that measure in a 89-8 vote. Several Senate panels will vote on Trump's nominees next week, including Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson . Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Florida, has not said if he'll support Tillerson, and could be a deciding vote against the nomination in committee. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "TEL AVIV \u2014 A casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that Russian diplomats and soldiers have taken to impersonating their American counterparts, gallivanting around the Middle East and inserting themselves into conflicts far beyond their own borders. Just this week, Moscow hosted a summit of divided Palestinian factions that yielded a fresh unity agreement. And on Sunday, Russian diplomats will again unite prominent Syrian rebel groups and regime negotiators in Astana, Kazakhstan, for a summit that aims to lend a degree of permanence to Syria's month-old cease-fire. Russian military engineers operate in Aleppo, Syria, in a handout photo released by Vladimir Putin's defense ministry. Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP If history is any judge, both initiatives are likely to fail. But when viewed from Moscow, notions of success and failure are immaterial to Vladimir Putin's broader ambition of hoisting Russia back into the club of the world's most powerful nations. \"Probably they feel that they are filling a vacuum left in the region\" by America's absence, said Mustafa Barghouti, a longtime Palestinian politician and negotiator who attended the Moscow conference. Russians, he said, \"are reestablishing themselves as a superpower.\" Enhancing Russia's global standing \u2014 particularly in neighboring Russian-speaking countries \u2014 and helping the country recover from its humiliating defeat in the Cold War has long thought to have been Putin's pet foreign policy project. Now that project has the added bonus of distracting from troubles at home: The plummeting ruble and low oil prices have left Russia's economy in a shambles. Promoting Russia's status as a major global power is part of Putin's push to compensate for his domestic failures, said Alexey Malashenko, a Russia analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Moscow Center. \u201cRussia is in the driving seat and Trump will simply react.\u201d \"It's very important for Putin and the Kremlin to form a leading role in the world because the domestic situation, the economy, is very poor,\" said Mr. Malashenko. \"So that's why he badly needs to position Russia as a huge power with national interests everywhere including in the Middle East.\" The chaos in the Middle East left by the Arab Spring uprisings has given Putin the perfect opening to promote Russian power. And former President Barack Obama's abortive efforts to restore stability to the region has opened that leadership vacuum even further, Barghouti said. Russia's ambitions may get another boost following Donald Trump's inauguration on Friday . Trump's stated plan to back Jewish settlement expansion in the West Bank and move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u2014 a divided city claimed by both Israeli Jews and Arabs \u2014 will immediately exclude Washington from its once dominant negotiating position, Barghouti said. \"Many Palestinians think that the involvement of Russia in this case creates better balance between different groups,\" Barghouti said. \"They are not interested, it seems to us, in being biased to any side. They are biased toward having a solution.\" Play ",

The high security section of the facility where high-risk inmates that included Mafia boss John Gotti and several close associates of Osama bin Laden spent their time awaiting trial, will now house accused Mexican drug lord and escape artist Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \u00a0(AP2009) NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0In the heart of bustling lower Manhattan sits one of the country's most secure federal lockups \u2014 and the new home of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman. Guzman, who pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges he ran one of the world's biggest drug-trafficking operations, can expect to be kept in a special unit inside the drab 12-story Metropolitan Correctional Center, where such other high-profile, high-risk inmates as Gambino crime family boss John Gotti and several former close associates of Osama bin Laden awaited trial. \"It's got extra security above and beyond what you would have in a restricted housing area,\" second only to the super-maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado, said Catherine Linaweaver, who served as the lockup's warden for 15 months before retiring in 2014. \"There is no other unit in the Bureau of Prisons like the high-security unit in New York.\" Expand / Contract In this photo provided U.S. law enforcement, authorities escort Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, center, from a plane to a waiting caravan of SUVs at Long Island MacArthur Airport on Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017, in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. The infamous drug kingpin who twice escaped from maximum-security prisons in Mexico was extradited at the request of the U.S. to face drug trafficking and other charges, and landed in New York late Thursday, a federal law enforcement official said. (U.S. law enforcement via AP) 'EL CHAPO' GUZMAN FACES LIFE IN PRISON; NOT-GUILTY PLEA ENTERED To authorities, it's a setting befitting a man who twice escaped from maximum-security Mexican prisons. Federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing that \"it is difficult to imagine another person with a greater risk of fleeing prosecution\" than Guzman. The jail is sandwiched between federal prosecutors' offices and two federal courthouses and is protected by steel barricades that can stop a 7 1/2-ton truck. Cameras capable of reading a newspaper a block away are trained on the area. Inmates can be transported to court through corridors linked to both courthouses, though Guzman will be ferried to and from court in Brooklyn, a potentially risky job for the U.S. Marshals Service. In the 10th-floor Special Housing Unit, known by its acronym, the SHU, pronounced like \"the shoe,\" around a dozen prisoners spend 23 hours a day in 20-by-12-foot cells, prohibited from communicating with one another. Meals are eaten in cells, and exercise is in a recreation area specifically for these inmates. FEMALE INMATES IN NY JAIL WELCOME 'EL CHAPO' BY WILDLY CHANTING HIS NAME To reduce the risk that a wealthy inmate such as Guzman might try to corrupt jail staff, the number of jailers who have access to him will likely be limited and each will undergo extra screenings by top jail officials, Linaweaver said. The special unit's strict confinement drew criticism in 2011 from the human rights group Amnesty International, which expressed concern that the sparse cells, exercise restrictions and isolation \"amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\" The jail saw an audacious escape attempt in 1982, when two armed people in a hijacked sightseeing helicopter tried to pluck an inmate off a roof. Four years earlier, three prisoners broke out by cutting through window bars. Security there was tightened significantly after Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, described as a right-hand man to bin Laden and awaiting trial in a terrorism case, used a sharpened comb to stab a guard on Nov. 1, 2000. Salim, who later apologized for the stabbing, is serving a life sentence. Guzman's case doesn't mark the first time federal authorities have grappled with how to hang onto a member of his Sinaloa drug cartel. Authorities expressed concern that the cartel might attempt to break a son of one of Guzman's cartel partners out of a federal lockup in Chicago in 2011. Of particular concern in that case: A fenced rooftop recreation center officials feared could make a defendant susceptible to sniper fire. The son was moved to a more secure facility.

    "text": "CBS News Jan 21, 2017 12:57 PM EST The Department of Justice has some good news for President Trump: its Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has concluded that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to hire\u00a0 his son-in-law, Jared Kushner , as a senior White House adviser does not violate\u00a0 federal anti-nepotism laws . The OLC issued a\u00a0 14-page memo \u00a0on Friday saying that the president is not barred from appointing Kushner because federal law grants the president special hiring authority that exempts him and his hires from anti-nepotism laws. Anti-nepotism laws prevent presidents from appointing family members to government positions. The statute, from 1967, reads: \u201cA public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official.\u201d The law specifically identifies the president as one of the \u201cpublic officials\u201d the law applies to and a \u201cson-in-law\u201d as a prohibited relative. But federal law also authorizes the president \u201cto appoint and fix the pay of employees in the White House Office without regard to any other provision of law regulating the employment or compensation of persons in the Government service.\u201d \u201cThe most natural and straightforward reading of [the law is] the President may appoint relatives as employees in the White House Office \u2018without regard to\u2019 the anti-nepotism statute,\u201d the OLC concluded. The OLC said the federal law is intended to give the president \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in hiring White House employees. Kushner, 35, is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and has served as a close adviser throughout the campaign and the transition. When Mr. Trump signed his\u00a0 first executive order \u00a0from the Oval Office Friday night, for example, Kushner was in the room. The memo also found a second legal path to permit Kushner\u2019s hire, citing precedent that anti-nepotism rules do not apply to the White House because it is not an \u201cExecutive agency.\u201d There have been previous instances where the OLC has been asked to grapple with this question. In 1977, the office advised that President Carter would not be able to appoint first lady Rosalynn Carter to serve as chair of the President\u2019s Commission on Mental Health as it was independent from the White House. Another example was in 1983 when it was asked to decide whether the president could appoint a relative to the Presidential Advisory Committee on Private Sector Initiatives. The OLC found that was very similar to the problems raised by Mrs. Carter\u2019s proposed service and concluded that the president could not appoint a relative as a member of that commission. \u201cIn choosing his personal staff, the President enjoys and unusual degree of freedom, which Congress found suitable to the demands of his office,\u201d the memo concludes. The memo was written by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Daniel Koffsky. He has been at the Justice Department for decades, and former Attorney General Eric Holder referred to him as a \u201cliving repository of OLC\u2019s precedents and practices.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Time Thousands gather at Washington Park in Cincinnati, before the Sister March to the Women's March on Washington Saturday, January 21, 2017. (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) Tricia Loper marched in Los Angeles with her children.\u00a0Lynne Avril, the 65-year-old\u00a0illustrator for the young Amelia Bedelia series, marched in Phoenix.\u00a0Melanie Hazim of Saddle Brook\u00a0carpooled with others to march in Trenton, N.J. And\u00a0Selva Urzagaste, 26, an immigrant from Bolivia, marched in Chicago. Across the country, on the second day of Donald J. Trump's presidency, demonstrations for women's rights drew massive crowds in cities big and small. Some 670 marches in all 50 states and 32 countries \u2014 the largest taking place in the nation's capital \u2014 were planned to send a message to the new president in protest of his agenda. The crowds were so large in some cities that marching was nearly impossible. In Chicago, organizers halted the march and rallied at Grant Park instead as crowds swelled to 150,000, although thousands still marched. In\u00a0Montpelier, Vt., state police closed three exits off Interstate 89 due to traffic caused by the march there.

In Boston, there were reports of more than 100,000 people marching in Boston Common to call\u00a0for a resistance. On the West Coast, more than 100,000 crowded the streets of Los Angeles to send a similar message. \u201cHopefully it will lead to greater political engagement,\" said\u00a0Robyn Grier, 34, of Los Angeles, who was taking part in the protest there with her husband. Here's a look at some of the marches, big and small, that took place across the country Saturday.

A plane pulled a banner around the city's downtown that read \"Congratulations President Trump,\" and as it circled, the crowds roared and broke out into anti-Trump chants. Ashley McGuire, 25, of Huntington Beach\u00a0voted for Barack Obama but stayed home in November. She turned out for the Los Angeles rally to support feminist causes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anything to do with it,\u201d she said of the election. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t interested in the parties running.\u201d Posted!

    "text": "Los Angeles Times staff While the great majority of the marchers were female, men turned out in considerable numbers as well. Jacob Osterman, 24, traveled from Boston with a group of friends to take part. \u201cI love and care about the women in my life, and this is a way to show that,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen are part of humanity, like all of us. How can anyone not understand that?\u201d Bits of overheard conversation reflected long journeys: \u201c\u2026 at 3 a.m. yesterday, no, wait, it was the day before \u2026\u201d or \u201c\u2026 and that was before we even got on the road!\u201d Creature comforts were hard to come by. Long lines stretched out of coffee shops and fast-food joints close to the gathering point on the National Mall. One woman asked her friend, only half jokingly, \u201cAre we going to have to rent a room to get a bathroom?\u201d\u00a0 The atmosphere was simultaneously lighthearted \u2014\u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m wearing my pink hat, so of course you\u2019ll be able to find me!\u201d one woman joked to her companion \u2014\u00a0and somber, as many pondered what lay ahead. \u201cPeople are really frightened about losing their health insurance,\u201d said Gretchen Stanford, from Alexandria, Va., just across the river from the District of Columbia.\u00a0\u201cAnd frightened about lots of other things.\u201d A contingent of young women and girls in hijabs waved to passers-by as they headed to the rally site, making their way under a highway overpass. Fifteen-year-old Rudy, wearing a white headscarf, was too shy to give her full name, but said with a smile: \u201cI want to be seen.\u201d The turnout for the march was a show of force that gave signs of exceeding the attendance of the presidential inauguration a day earlier. Washington Metro trains that had been lightly used Friday were jammed so full of protesters with signs and pink hats on Saturday that crowds on platforms had to wait for more trains. Outside the Capitol building, a constant stream of thousands of cheering women emerging from Metro stops headed for the march\u2019s starting location. Actress America Ferrera got the rally off to a rousing start, invoking her birth in Los Angeles to Honduran parents. \u201cIt\u2019s been a heart-rending time to be both a woman and an immigrant. Our dignity, our character, our rights have been under attack,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cBut the president is not America. We are America.\u201d Gloria Steinem, a grande dame of the feminist movement, scorned the notion of male patriarchy, declaring, \u201cNo more asking Daddy!\u201d Actress Scarlett Johansson , for her part, mounted a passionate defense of Planned Parenthood, threatened with de-funding under the new administration. Headline performers in Washington included Janelle Monae, Samantha Ronson, the Indigo Girls and Mary Chapin Carpenter.\u00a0 Many of the marchers were non-celebrities who simply said they wanted to share a moment of history. Michelle Pierson of Van Nuys and Nicole Myers of Woodland Hills talked their husbands into caring for their respective children so the two women could spend the week protesting in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cWe had to do something to deal with our frustration, our sadness, our rage,\u201d\u00a0said Pierson, 38, a stay-at-home mom. Myers added that she had a 10-year-old son. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think someone could speak like that and be president,\u201d\u00a0said the 40-year-old, who owns a picture-framing shop. Some marchers said they were worried about scenes of unrest associated with inaugural commemorations Friday. Small groups smashed windows and set fires to protest against Trump, and there were some tense Inauguration Day exchanges between Trump backers and opponents. \u201cWhatever happens, we have to keep it peaceful,\u201d said Leahn Murray, a 33-year-old emergency medical technician from Buffalo, N.Y., who was stenciling a sign reading \u201cResistance Is Built On Hope.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t use violence to make our point,\u201d she said,\u00a0\u201cbecause the whole point is that people need to be safe.\u201d Caption Recap: Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C.

    "text": "View slideshow Updated at 4 p.m. ET The National Mall has flooded with pink, as demonstrators descend on the nation's capital Saturday for the Women's March on Washington. Just one day after President Trump's inauguration, marchers from across the country have gathered in the city to protest his agenda and support for women's rights. Women's March On Washington Goes Worldwide: Snapshots From Around The Globe The event opened with a rally, to be followed by the march proper \u2014 which had a path laid out from a starting position near the U.S. Capitol to its endpoint near the Washington Monument. The city's metro system reported 275,000 rides as of 11 a.m. According to metro officials that's eight times more than a normal Saturday. Reuters adds that the number is also \"82,000 more than the 193,000 rides reported at the same point on Friday,\" the day of Trump's inauguration. \u2014 Lauren Gambino (@LGamGam) January 21, 2017 In fact, the number of marchers swelled to the point of prompting reports there would be no space for a formal procession \u2014 a claim rebutted by organizers Saturday afternoon in a statement. \"We are marching,\" reads the statement. \"We are marching straight ahead toward the Washington Monument to the ellipse of the White House.\" The event grew from humble origins \u2014 a simple Facebook invitation after Election Day \u2014 to the much more massive demonstration seen Saturday. By the time marchers hit the streets, the Women's March on Washington developed a broad platform of progressive political positions, a slate of celebrity performers and a series of sister marches planned across the world \u2014 on all seven continents. For protester Amy Jackson, though, the matter was simple: She just wanted to \"make her voice heard,\" she tells NPR's Marisa Penaloza. Jackson, who traveled to D.C. from Chocowinity, N.C., to be part of the march, said, \"It was very important to be here today.\" The Scene On The Ground Among the crowd that gathered for the rally outside the National Museum of the American Indian, NPR's Sarah McCammon reported signs supporting a wide array of causes \u2014 from women's rights and LGBTQ rights, to Black Lives Matter and excoriations of xenophobia. One thing seemed to be almost universal, though: The pink knitted caps known as \"pussyhats\" among the marchers, in protest of Trump's past comments about women. (Left to right) Melissa Breen, Laura Jamison, Sandy Cuza and Kathryn Wehrmann chat while sporting matching pink hats in support of the march. Becky Harlan/NPR hide caption toggle caption Becky Harlan/NPR Popular as they may have been, the pussyhats were not the only costume worn by marchers. Others wore their causes on their sleeves, dressing in attire to call attention to issues like Native rights and environmental fears. Article continues after sponsorship In video Sarah recorded a block or two from the main rally, it appears there were marchers in a menagerie of outfits. Credit: Sarah McCammon/NPR Meanwhile, at a nearby metro station, NPR's Pam Fessler reported the mood among the demonstrators has been more festive than protests Friday. Most of the demonstrators are women, Pam says, but some men have joined the march, as well \u2014 including one man carrying a sign reading: \"This is what a feminist looks like.\" From the main rally stage, musicians and speakers addressed the crowd in an event that lasted some five hours \u2014 more than two hours longer than anticipated. The reason for that overflow was partly its smattering of surprise guests. Beyond the planned performances and speeches from figures like Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Gloria Steinem, others including Madonna and Alicia Keys took the stage. ",

Justice Department officials had scrambled to respond to Mexico's last-minute action in sending El Chapo to the United States for trial. Why the Renewed Interest? The U.S. had sought his extradition for two years, and rumors that he might be turned over to American authorities came and went over the summer. Then suddenly Thursday evening Mexican authorities announced that his legal appeals were exhausted and he was on his way aboard a Mexican jet. Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is escorted from a plane to a waiting caravan of SUVs at Long Island MacArthur Airport on Jan. 19 in Ronkonkoma, New York. The infamous drug kingpin who twice escaped from maximum-security prisons in Mexico was extradited at the request of the U.S. to face drug trafficking and other charges, and landed in New York late Thursday, a federal law enforcement official said. U.S. Law Enforcement / AP Mexico decided to deliver El Chapo \u2014 Joaquin Guzman Loera \u2014 instead of allowing the U.S. to pick him up and bring him here to face a raft of federal charges. Some US officials said Mexico was eager to get him to the U.S. before the Trump administration took office. That goal was met, with just over 14 hours to spare. What Are His Charges? He faces federal charges filed in Brooklyn accusing him and his Sinaloa Cartel of importing more than 200 metric tons of cocaine into the United States, as well as heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana. The U.S. was also seeking to recover $14 billion in cash that investigators say the cartel smuggled from the US. The charges said he directed assassins to kill thousands of drug trafficking competitors between 2007 and 2011. The Drug Enforcement Administration said the Sinaloa Carl used airplanes, boats, and submarines to bring the drugs into ports it controlled in Mexico. From there, they say, it was shipped across the border to distribution centers in the United States. What Kind of Penalties Might He Face? If convicted, Guzman Loera, who is 59, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Justice Department officials said the US agreed not to seek the death penalty as part of the negotiations with the Mexican government to secure his extradition. Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is escorted by soldiers during a presentation in Mexico City, Jan. 8, 2016. On Jan. 19, 2017, Mexican government officials announced that El Chapo would be extradited to the United States. Tomas Bravo / Reuters \"Guzman's story is not one of a do-gooder or a Robin Hood or even one of a famous escape artist,\" said Robert Capers, Brooklyn's US Attorney. \"Guzman's destructive and murderous rise as an international narcotics trafficker is akin to a small cancerous tumor that metastasized and grew into a full-blown scourge that for decades littered the streets of Mexico with the casualties of violent drug wars over turf.\" Charges against El Chapo were filed in several states, including California, Florida, and Illinois. A crime commission in Chicago declared him the first Public Enemy Number One since Al Capone. But Capers said federal prosecutors decided Brooklyn was the best place to charge and try him based on the number of witnesses available, among other factors. Pete Williams ",

Sixteen people were killed and over two dozen injured in a tragedy that sparked a national day of mourning in Hungary . The impact of the crash just before midnight Friday on the northern Italian highway was so violent that the overpass support column actually entered several rows into the bus, officials said Saturday. The ensuing fireball burned some of the 16 dead beyond recognition and torched the bus, leaving just a skeleton of twisted steel. No other vehicles were involved in the crash near Verona, and the cause wasn't known, said a tearful police commander, Girolamo Lacquaniti. Of the 39 survivors, 26 were injured, some seriously, he said. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told reporters in Budapest that one passenger was in an induced coma. \"The fire was so huge it took up practically half of the three-lane highway,\" said Lanfranco Fossa, a businessman who stopped to offer help when he realized some injured youths had escaped the flames. \"These poor creatures, almost all of them were in short-sleeves, some without shoes,\" he said. \"I gave them what I had: a shirt, a blanket. And others stopped to give them things as well.\" Fossa said he also offered the kids his cellphone so they could call home to Budapest. He stayed over an hour to help translate for rescue crews, helping them find the most severely injured and understand what had happened. The students all spoke excellent English \u2014 but the rescuers didn't. Fossa wasn't the only hero. One teacher on the bus managed to save some of the kids, suffering serious burns to his back as he did so, said Judit Timaffy of Hungary's consulate, who was at the scene. And one student had the smarts to smash open a bus window with the emergency hammer. \"The kids told me that the fire started and they escaped from the fire, breaking the windows of the bus,\" she said. \"Some of them managed to escape, but many were left inside.\" In Budapest, the government declared a day of national mourning for Monday, with flags to be flown at half-staff and schools around the country holding commemorations. A black flag flew Saturday above the entrance to the Szinyei Merse Pal high school in Budapest. A few hundred students and parents gathered for a vigil outside the school, some of them weeping, lighting small candles and laying flowers in memory of the victims. \"We knew many of them, but the ones we were closest to and in daily contact are mostly all right,\" student Tamas Mezo said after placing candles at the school's door. He said the school organized a ski camp each year, involving about 50-60 students and a few teachers. \"I was very much planning on going this year but in the end it didn't work out,\" Mezo said. \"There were three or four teachers on the bus and unfortunately one of them did not survive. Our hearts our hurting because we loved him.\" There were no official details about those who died in the crash and the exact number on board was not clear. Hungary's Foreign Ministry said it was told 54 passengers and two drivers were on the bus, but said it believes the actual number was higher. The numbers given by Italian officials added up to 55 people. According to Szijjarto, the bus driver lost control of the vehicle, which hit a guard rail before the overpass support and then exploded. Investigators found no brake marks at the scene, he said. Timaffy said investigators were looking into the possibility the driver fell asleep at the wheel. RAI state radio said a Slovenian truck driver traveling behind the bus had noticed a problem with one of its wheels and tried to alert the driver. But the driver didn't react quickly enough, RAI said. The Slovenian truck driver stayed at the scene to help until investigators arrived. By Saturday afternoon, the survivors had been taken to a nearby hotel and were being interviewed by investigators, the ANSA news agency reported. The parents of some of the students were heading there to bring them home. Condolences to Hungary came in from Italy's president and its foreign minister, as well as the German chancellor. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Winfield reported from Rome. Gorondi reported from Budapest.

(Erin Hooley/Chicago Tribune) Hundreds of thousands of people march through the streets during the Women's March on Chicago Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017, in Chicago. (Erin Hooley/Chicago Tribune) Duaa Eldeib and Marwa Eltagouri Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune The women of Chicago would not be stopped. A quarter million demonstrators poured into downtown on Saturday, so many that organizers of the Women's March on Chicago told the throngs that the event would only be a rally because there wasn't room to march. But people marched anyway. \"Michigan Avenue is flooded with marchers,\" march co-chairwoman Ann Scholhamer told the crowd gathered at Jackson and Columbus drives a little before 11 a.m. \"Wabash is flooded with marchers. State Street is flooded with marchers. People are still waiting for trains in Oak Park . We called, and you came.\" So what was supposed to be a pre-march rally, with a lineup of more than 30 speakers, turned into the main event. City officials would echo organizers decision a short later, saying there would no longer be a \"pedestrian component\" to the march, and that Grant Parkhad reached capacity. \"There is no safe way to march,\" Scholhamer told the Tribune. \"We are just going to sing and dance and make our voices heard here.\" (Perry Stein, Steve Hendrix, Abigail Hauslohner) But white-haired grandmothers and bearded and burly fathers, mothers with infants held close to their chests and teenagers in pink knitted hats marched anyway. They shut down parts of the Loop, splintering off in every direction. They raised their signs above their shoulders and chanted, \"This is what democracy looks like,\" and \"No Trump . No KKK. No fascist USA.\" Lee Hart, who took the train in from Evanston with her wife and twin boys, was among many who said she had not heard the announcement calling off the marching, but when informed by a reporter, she continued to make her way down Jackson. \"You can't say you're stopping the march,\" she said. \"It's too powerful.\" Chicago's march was one of hundreds that took place globally in solidarity with the Women's March on Washington. Planned for the day after President Donald Trump's inauguration, the demonstrations aimed to draw attention to women's rights, as well as a myriad of other issues including civil rights, immigration and racial justice. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators on Saturday packed the streets of several cities, from New York to Los Angeles and Paris to Sydney. Organizers initially estimated that the Chicago march would draw 22,000, but by week's end it had jumped to 50,000. An estimated 250,000 people gathered to rally\u00a0in downtown Chicago as a sister event\u00a0to the National Women's March taking place in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, 2017. Similar to Chicago, the Washington turnout was so large that the original march route alongside the National Mall was impassable. Protesters headed toward the White House using several different streets, resulting in a chaotic scene that clogged downtown Washington. Officials estimate the crowd in Washington could be more than half a million people. The march appeared to have attracted more people than Trump's inauguration on Friday, based on figures from transportation officials. While some people who remained at Chicago's rally said they were disappointed at the change of plans, Corey Escue said she was unfazed because it meant more people could witness history and have their voices heard. Nancy Bishop, a 77-year-old grandmother from Glenview, who used a walker, said she never planned to march. For her, it was about being counted. \"Marching for me is really an oxymoron now,\" she said. \"When you gather like this, it makes you more likely to actively participate in our democracy.\" Marikah Davin, 27, serendipitously ran into demonstrators marching through the Loop upon getting off the Blue Line at Jackson with her friends. They joined the crowd without ever making it to the rally, and marched with them through the Loop. Read the story \"We voted, but we still feel a lot of anger and worry,\" Davin, of the Ukrainian Village neighborhood, said as she held up her sign, which read \"Love trumps Trump.\" \"I didn't realize how warm and loving (this march) would be,\" she said. Throughout the day, demonstrators stopped to read and admire the hundreds of signs that floated above the crowds. They were diverse and abundant, with messages that read, \"I will not go quietly into the 1950s\" and \"Proud my daughter fights like a girl.\" Some demonstrators carried tasseled banners, while others held cardboard diagrams of vaginas. Nine-year-old Josie Schenk enlisted help from her brother and sister when she colored a sign that read, \"Your generation will build a wall. (Ours) will knock it down!\" Her mother, Kate Schenk, said she was initially disappointed that she couldn't make it Washington for the march, but that feeling vanished after she marched alongside her family and the massive crowd in Chicago. \"This is so much better,\" Kate Schenk said. (Kim Geiger and Katherine Skiba) The unseasonably warm weather seemed to fuel excitement. The sequins sewn into some women's pink \"pussy hats,\" which have become a symbol of the movement, glistened in the sun. Husband and wife Robin Harris and Mark Michaels, who are both retired and live in Arlington Heights, held hands as they walked. Harris remarked at how many times she heard \"thank you\" and \"excuse me\" throughout the day. \"Everyone is so positive,\" she said. City officials, who would not comment on the crowd estimates, said in a statement that the rally and \"spontaneous march\" were largely \"peaceful,\" with only limited disruption. Before the rally officially kicked off, 39-year-old Mary Hurtt began leading the thousands of women behind her in a chant. \"Women of Chicago!\" she cried, asking the crowd to repeat her words. \"Fired up! Ready to go!\" The rally began with light-hearted music but quickly moved into difficult discussions on racism, homophobia, xenophobia and gun violence. Samantha Marie Ware, a Chicago cast member of 'Hamilton,' became emotional on stage recalling how she, as a black woman, once felt as though she couldn't accomplish her goals because of her race. She encouraged the women before her to stand up. Chicago women head to Women's March on Washington for bachelorette party Rachel Ellison, 32, is heading to Washington, D.C., from Chicago on Jan. 19, 2017, to celebrate her\u00a0bachelorette party with friends during the Women's March on Washington. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) Rachel Ellison, 32, is heading to Washington, D.C., from Chicago on Jan. 19, 2017, to celebrate her\u00a0bachelorette party with friends during the Women's March on Washington. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) See more videos \"We must equip ourselves with the wisdom of MLK, that the time is always right to do right,\" she said. \"We must stand up for fear and speak up when we hear prejudices against our brothers or sisters. We must and will hold those in power accountable.\" Also addressing the crowd was Cleo Pendleton, the mother of Hadiya, whose shooting death nearly four years ago made her a national symbol for the city's struggle with violence. Pendleton talked to the crowd about how women's rights \u2014 and mother's rights \u2014 speaks to the core of Chicago's gun violence problem. \"We are here because we are women. Because we have rights. And we do not \u2014 do not \u2014 agree with this administration's perspective on guns. Yes, are you entitled to the second amendment? Absolutely,\" she said. \"But (what about) my basic human right to build my family and for my family to survive?\" As the speakers took turns on stage, thousands of demonstrators fanned out, spilling on to the side streets, where they kept marching. A man played the \"Star Spangled Banner\" on his saxophone. Demonstrators took to the streets in Washington, D.C., other American cities and also\u00a0around the world as part of marches calling for equality and inclusion for women. By early afternoon, throngs of marchers had descended on Federal Plaza; some continued to cluster around the downtown into the evening.

The petition was created Jan. 20 and called to \u201cimmediately release Donald Trump\u2019s full tax returns, with all information needed to verify emoluments clause compliance.\u201d It urged transparency in the face of the \u201cunprecedented economic conflicts of this administration.\u201d The emoluments clause is a reference to the Constitution\u2019s restrictions on any person holding public office from accepting any fee or salary from a foreign government or state-run foreign companies without Congress\u2019 consent.\u00a0 Less than 24 hours after the petition went live online, more than 131,000 people attached their signatures to it -- far exceeding the 100,000 signatures needed for the White House to respond to it.\u00a0 info Close It is unclear whether the Trump team will continue to adhere to the Obama administration\u2019s policy of responding to petitions that reach that goal. Throughout his presidential campaign and despite accusations that he had financial ties to Russia, Mr. Trump has dismissed calls to release his tax documents, saying he is under audit by the IRS.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not releasing the tax returns because, as you know, they\u2019re under audit,\u201d Mr. Trump said earlier this month during his first press conference since the election. He then swatted away further questions about taxes, telling journalists that the American public had no concerns about it: \u201cYou know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? They\u2019re the only ones...I won. I mean, I became president. No, I don\u2019t think they care at all. I don\u2019t think they care at all. I think you care.\u201d According to the latest polling, however, most Americans believe Mr. Trump should still release his tax returns.\u00a0 Seventy-four percent of Americans surveyed in an ABC News/Washington Post poll this month say he should release his tax records. Forty-nine percent of Republicans believe Mr. Trump should release them. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Jan. 21) AP President Trump speaks at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., on Jan. 21, 2017. (Photo: Olivier Douliery, Pool/European Pressphoto Agency) WASHINGTON \u2014 No one will support the intelligence community more than he will, President Trump told a crowd at CIA headquarters Saturday, while he also attacked the news media for reporting that he had a \"feud\" with intelligence agencies. While at the CIA, Trump also blasted media coverage of his inauguration\u00a0on Friday \u2014\u00a0a protest angrily echoed later by press secretary Sean Spicer , who accused reporters of deliberate \"false reporting\" of attendance and interest in Trump's swearing-in. While Trump has clashed with intelligence officials in recent weeks over investigations into Russian election activity, the new president told intelligence agency employees that \"you're going to get so much backing\" from his administration. Describing the CIA as a\u00a0key\u00a0to victory over Islamic State-style terrorists,\u00a0Trump also talked politics during his visit, telling employees that\u00a0he got the most votes in last year's election from members of the military, law enforcement\u00a0and intelligence communities, and \"probably almost\u00a0everybody in this room voted for me\" in the election, \"We're all on the same wavelength, folks,\" Trump said while standing at a memorial wall honoring CIA agents who have given their lives in service to the nation. President Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive for the National Prayer Service at the National Cathedral on Jan. 21, 2017, in Washington. \u00a0(Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) Trump's CIA trip \u2014 his first official visit as chief executive \u2014 came hours after he attended a National Prayer Service at Washington National Cathedral, nearly 24 hours after being sworn in as the nation's 45th president. Meanwhile, thousands marched in the streets of Washington and other cities across the globe to protest his presidency and even challenge its legitimacy. In other second-day developments: \u2022 The White House announced that British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet with Trump in Washington late next week. \u2022 \u00a0Spicer said Trump will meet with Mexico President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Jan. 31\u00a0and that the two leaders spoke by phone about trade, immigration, security\u00a0and other issues. \u2022 Trump also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a partner along with Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump has vowed to change. \u2022\u00a0Trump repeated a campaign line that the United States\u00a0should have \"kept\"' Iraq's oil after the 2003 invasion, saying that might have blocked the rise of the Islamic State. He added: \"Maybe we'll have another chance.\" The president again suggested he opposed the Iraq war, though interviews at the time indicated otherwise. \u2022\u00a0The Trump Department of Justice said the president is within his rights to hire son-in-law Jared Kushner as a White House adviser ; a Justice\u00a0memorandum said a nepotism law passed by Congress does not apply to the executive branch. \u2022 \u00a0Trump again took to social media, tweeting that \"I am honored to\u00a0serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States!\" Trump's visit to CIA headquarters in Virginia resembled something of a peace mission. During the transition between election and inauguration, leaders of the intelligence community\u00a0said Russia engineered the hacking\u00a0in an effort to help Trump, while Trump and supporters said other countries could have been involved. He also claimed the intelligence community leaked damaging information on him, including allegations out of Russia. (Trump later acknowledged that Russia was behind the hacking\u00a0but that it didn't affect the counting of votes.) In his appearance before CIA employees, Trump blamed the media for what he called false reporting of a \"feud\" with intelligence, saying that \"I have a running war\u00a0with the media; they are among the most dishonest human beings on earth.\" He also attacked media coverage of parts of his Inauguration Day, saying media outlets played down the size of the crowd he drew .

A second day of demonstra... \u201cIt looked honestly, it looked like a million-and-a-half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to Washington Monument,\u201d Mr. Trump added. He took umbrage at some media coverage that suggested much lower numbers. \u201cI get this network and it showed an empty field,\u201d he marveled. \u201cAnd it said we drew 250,000 people, now that\u2019s not bad but it\u2019s a lie.\u201d \u00a0Mr. Trump claimed \u201cthe 20-block area all the way back to the Washington Monument was packed.\u201d Media coverage of the inauguration crowds relied on aerial photos of the two addresses from the opposite end of the National Mall to draw comparisons, with President Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration apparently drawing much denser crowds. Spicer made no reference of aerial photos in the briefing, using instead two photographs from behind the Capitol, an angle from which the disparity is not as clear.\u00a0 Speaking to CBSN after Spicer\u2019s statement, CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett said: \u201cIt is quite clear that this administration will make whatever representations it wants to on its impression and interpretation of the news and drive that right back at the news media if it thinks it is being unfair or inflicting damage on the image this White House wants to display.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this where it was so intense, so harsh and passionate right off the beginning,\u201d said Garrett. \u201cSo much of it was about what the media got wrong from the interpretation of this White House and a declaration that this antagonism is going to continue because this president feels duty-bound, on behalf of this movement that Sean Spicer spoke about, to speak beyond the media and criticize it whenever he is justified in doing so.\u201d A combination of photos taken at the National Mall shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (L) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009, in Washington, DC, U.S.\u00a0 REUTERS/Lucas Jackson (L), Stelios Varias TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY - RTSWJVI On Friday evening, the National Park Service was ordered by the Interior Department to cease tweeting after a staffer retweeted a reporter\u2019s comment on the sparser crowds that appeared to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.

About 10:30 a.m., a 60-year-old man was southbound on Southport Avenue when he made a left turn onto Clybourn Avenue. A father who was pushing his daughter in a stroller was attempting to cross the street in the crosswalk on Clybourn when the 2015 Toyota Corolla hit the stroller, said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago police spokesman.\u00a0 The baby was tossed to the pavement, but was alert and responding. Officers said the baby did not cry until the paramedics were evaluating her for injuries. The baby was taken to Lurie Children's Hospital where she was listed in good condition, Estrada said. The father was not injured during the incident, and the driver stayed on the scene. The driver told officers the sun's glare caused him not to see the baby and her father crossing the road. As of 1 p.m. Saturday, no citations had been issued. ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Jan 21, 2017 10:20 AM EST FARINDOLA, Italy -- Emergency crews pulled out four more survivors from the rubble of a hotel crushed by an avalanche and were searching Saturday for more who may still be alive as family members awaited word if their relatives were among the lucky ones.\u00a0 Avalanche buries Italian hotel, dozens missing The overnight operations raised to at least nine the number of people found alive in the rubble of Wednesday\u2019s avalanche that demolished the Hotel Rigopiano in the Gran Sasso mountain area when tons of snow rushed down the mountainside, slamming into the resort.\u00a0 Dozens of family members and friends kept a tense vigil overnight, and four were rewarded with the arrival of their loved ones at the hospital early Saturday. But one father who has been waiting since Wednesday evening for word of his son\u2019s fate erupted in front of television cameras, pointing angrily at the sedans of local officials. \u201cWhat are they doing? They aren\u2019t doing anything. Why didn\u2019t they go get the kids out the night before the disaster?\u201d the man yelled, referring to his son, Stefano Feniello and his fiancee Francesca Bronzi, who was among those hospitalized. The father, who did not give his name, said he had been told Feniello had survived, but officials had supplied no clear information by midday Saturday, nearly three days after the tragedy. \u201cWhy are they here, taking all the credit. They are disgusting. It is an outrage. I am waiting for three days for my son. They said that my son had been recovered but he hasn\u2019t arrived.\u201d Meters-high piles of snow piled up in the central Italian area after days of snowfall earlier in the week that blocked roads and left many of the guests unable to leave before the avalanche. Firefighter spokesman Alberto Maiolo said a total of four bodies had been found in the rubble. Some 30 people, including guests and workers, were believed to have been inside the hotel when the avalanche struck. \u201cWe are still working, we are verifying the signals we have and continuing our activities to verify if there are other people and when we will be able to pull them out,\u201d Maiolo said Saturday morning. Two other people escaped the devastation just before the avalanche struck, including Giampiero Parete, a chef vacationing with his family who first sounded the alarm by calling his boss. He was reunited with his wife and two children Saturday after they were among the first to be located and extracted from the debris. \u201cThank you everyone from my heart,\u201d Parete wrote on Facebook. \u201cBig hugs.\u201d In all, four children were safely brought out of the rubble and taken to Pescara hospital, where they were reported in good condition.\u00a0 On Friday, the Italian fire brigade tweeted a video showing children being pulled out alive.\u00a0 The tweet in Italian reads: \u201cthe moving moment when three small children were rescued.\u201d \u2014 Vigili del Fuoco (@emergenzavvf) January 20, 2017 Nine-year-old Edoardo Di Carlo told his rescuers he had gone into the billiards room to play when he was trapped by the avalanche, and that three children had been together. When the rescuers, eager for details that might aid further rescues, gently asked him if there were other people, including grown-ups, the boy replied: \u201cOnly the mamma of another child.\u201d He started sounding weary, and the rescuers quickly encouraged him, saying, \u201cbravissimo.\u201d\u00a0 The four children and five adults who were being treated at the hospital Saturday, included one person who underwent surgery for an upper arm compression injury, said, Rossano di Luzio, a physician at the hospital. Speaking of the four children who are doing well in the hospital, the doctor added: \u201cTheir state of mind is that of someone who has suffered a drama and who was in a truly precarious position for many hours.\u201d In the case of two of the children, the fate of their parents is still unknown.\u00a0 All the patients, including the children, were being given psychological assistance, and had family members near them throughout the night, di Luzio said. The avalanche dumped 16\u00bd feet of snow on top of the resort, located 115 miles northeast of Rome. The region, which has been blanketed by heavy snowfall, was also rocked by four strong earthquakes on Wednesday, though it wasn\u2019t clear if they set off the avalanches. Prosecutors have opened a manslaughter investigation and were looking into whether the avalanche threat was taken seriously enough, and whether the hotel should have been evacuated earlier given the heavy snowfall and forecasts. \u201cThat hotel... should it have been open?\u201d prosecutor Christina Tedeschini was quoted by the ANSA news agency as saying. \u201cIf the people wanted to leave, what prevented them from doing so?\u201d Parete, the survivor who sounded the alarm, said the guests had all checked out and were waiting for the road to be cleared so they could evacuate. But the snowplow never arrived and the avalanche hit around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 21, 2017 6:22 PM EST WASHINGTON -- Wearing pink, pointy-eared \u201cpussyhats\u201d to mock the new president , hundreds of thousands of women massed in the nation\u2019s capital and cities around the globe Saturday to send Donald Trump an emphatic message that they won\u2019t let his agenda go unchallenged over the next four years. As night fell on the East Coast, thousands of protesters from the Women\u2019s March on Washington were still marching through the city\u2019s streets in opposition to President Donald Trump. Police officers stationed near the Ellipse south of the White House are chatting and joking with protesters. Some protesters chanted, \u201cWelcome to your first day, we will never go away.\u201d Others were chanting about democracy and women\u2019s rights, or holding protest signs. Many of the protesters were waiting out a logjam of people trying to exit the area. Transportation officials had earlier warned there would be delays as the hundreds of thousands of protesters tried to take public transportation out of the city after the march formally ended.\u00a0 America Ferrera speaks at Women's March on Washington Transportation officials in Washington say Saturday is already the fifth busiest Saturday in the subway system\u2019s history.\u00a0 By 4 p.m. Saturday, Metro tweeted that it has recorded more than 597,000 trips on the system and seen heavy crowds entering at all downtown stations. Metro spokesman Dan Stessel says the system usually sees about 620,000 trips on a normal weekday and it\u2019s many times busier than a usual Saturday. Stessel says the ridership numbers are on track to ultimately top the system\u2019s busiest Saturday of all time, the day of the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear hosted by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert in 2010. More than 825,000 trips were taken that day.\u00a0 The women brandished signs with messages such as \u201cWomen won\u2019t back down\u201d and \u201cLess fear more love\u201d and decried Mr. Trump\u2019s stand on such issues as abortion, health care, diversity and climate change. Their message reverberated at demonstrations around the globe, from New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles to Paris, Berlin, London, Prague, Sydney and beyond.\u00a0 \u201cI feel very optimistic even though it\u2019s a miserable moment,\u201d said Madeline Schwartzman of New York City, who brought her twin 13-year-old daughters to the Washington rally. \u201cI feel power.\u201d \u201cWe march today for the moral core of this nation, against which our new president is waging a war,\u201d actress America Ferrera told the Washington crowd. \u201cOur dignity, our character, our rights have all been under attack and a platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday. But the president is not America. ... We are America and we are here to stay.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 Madonna , who spoke at the event, said it took \u201cthis horrific moment\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration as president to wake up the United States. The pop singer used several obscenities during a speech at the Women\u2019s March on Washington to emphasize her opposition to Mr. Trump. Madonna at Women's March: \"I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House\" She said Saturday\u2019s march means \u201cthat we are far from the end\u201d and it is the start of a revolution to fight for the right to be free and equal. She also said like-minded Americans need to join together to make it \u201cthrough this darkness\u201d and show that \u201cwe are not afraid, that we are not alone.\u201d There were early signs that the crowds in Washington could top those that gathered for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday. City officials said organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington had more than doubled their turnout estimate to 500,000 as crowds began swelling and subways into the city became clogged with participants.\u00a0 Figures from transportation officials in Washington also suggested more people may be on the National Mall for the women\u2019s march than came for the inauguration.\u00a0 On crowd size, one organizer told CBS News\u2019 Nicole Sganga that at least 500,000 were in attendance but the official said she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were closer to a million. As of 11 a.m. Saturday, 275,000 people had taken trips on the city\u2019s subway system.\u00a0 On Inauguration Day, 193,000 trips had been taken as of that time, and the rail system opened an hour earlier that day, at 4 a.m.\u00a0 Women\u2019s March on Washington leave their signs by the U.S. Capitol building, where Mr. Trump had his inauguration ceremony Friday. Close Nicole Sganga/CBS News In the afternoon, women\u2019s march participants left their signs and posters on the barricade facing the west front of the Capitol building, where Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony took place. It wasn\u2019t just a Washington phenomenon and it wasn\u2019t just women: More than 600 \u201csister marches\u201d were planned across the country and around the world, and plenty of men were part of the tableau, too. Organizers estimated 3 million would march worldwide. As the rally alongside the National Mall took shape, Mr. Trump opened his first full day as president by attending a prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral, a tradition for the day after inauguration. He later got a view of the protesters from the window of his limo.\u00a0 President Trump, family attend National Prayer Service His motorcade was on its way back to the White House from the prayer service when he passed several prominent groups of protesters. As he crossed one intersection, cars started honking loudly. Some protesters held up signs that likened women\u2019s rights to human rights. It was a nod to a famous speech that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton gave in China as first lady.\u00a0 Other signs read \u201cWe stand with Planned Parenthood.\u201d\u00a0 Two tweets posted on early Saturday afternoon from the @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS Twitter accounts said, \u201cI am honored to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States!\u201d Neither of the tweets mentioned the march. Mr. Trump later spoke at the CIA\u2019s headquarters. \u00a0 I am honored to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 21, 2017 On the streets of Washington, feminist leader Gloria Steinem described the worldwide mobilization as \u201cthe upside of the downside: This is an outpouring of energy and democracy like I have never seen in my very long life.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSometimes we must put our bodies where our beliefs are,\u201d she told the Washington crowd, labeling Mr. Trump an \u201cimpossible president.\u201d\u00a0 Clinton, who lost to Mr. Trump, took to Twitter to thank the participants. \u201cThanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch,\u201d Clinton tweeted. \u201cImportant as ever. I truly believe we\u2019re always Stronger Together.\u201d Thanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch . Important as ever. I truly believe we're always Stronger Together. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 21, 2017 In Washington, a massive turnout affected plans to march. So many people packed the original route along the south side of the National Mall that organizers couldn\u2019t lead a formal trek toward White House. Interim D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said on Independence Avenue, \u201cThe crowd stretches so far that there\u2019s no room left to march.\u201d Instead, march organizers directed the crowd to take a new route to meet up at the Ellipse, a grassy area between the Washington Monument and the White House. Retired teacher Linda Lastella, 69, who came to Washington from Metuchen, New Jersey, said she had never marched before but felt the need to speak out when \u201cmany nations are experiencing this same kind of pullback and hateful, hateful attitudes.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt just seemed like we needed to make a very firm stand of where we were,\u201d she said. Joy Rodriguez, of Miami, arrived with her husband, William, and their two daughters, ages 12 and 10. \u201cI want to make sure their rights are not infringed on in these years coming up,\u201d Joy Rodriguez said. \u00a0\u00a0 Rose Wurm, 64, a retired medical secretary from Bedford, Pennsylvania, boarded a Washington-bound bus in Hagerstown, Maryland, at 7 a.m. carrying two signs: one asking Mr. Trump to stop tweeting, and one asking him to fix, not trash, the Obamacare health law. \u201cThere are parts of it that do need change. It\u2019s something new, something unique that\u2019s not going to be perfect right out of the gate,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Many arrived wearing hand-knit \u201cpussyhats\u201d -- a message of female empowerment aimed squarely at Mr.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s crude boast about grabbing women\u2019s genitals . \u00a0\u00a0 The march attracted significant support from celebrities. Ferrera led the artists\u2019 contingent, and speakers included Scarlett Johansson and Ashley Judd. The promised performance lineup included Janelle Monae, Maxwell, Samantha Ronson, the Indigo Girls and Mary Chapin Carpenter. Cher, Katy Perry and Julianne Moore all were expected to attend.\u00a0 Filmmaker Michael Moore spoke at the march, saying he was there \u201cto vow to end the Trump carnage.\u201d He was riffing on a phrase from Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural address, in which the president said he would stop the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d Michael Moore speaks at Women's March on Washington Moore urged attendees to call their members of Congress every day to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and said those concerned about Mr. Trump should join organizations like Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and environmental groups. He said joined Planned Parenthood on Saturday morning. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said best thing the federal government led by Mr. Trump can do is \u201cleave us alone.\u201d Bowser said she was speaking at the women\u2019s march on behalf of all female elected officials, and that women are more harshly and unfairly criticized at every level of government. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Marlita Gogan, who came to Washington from Houston for the inauguration, said police advised her family not to wear their \u201cMake America Great Again Hats\u201d as they walked through crowds of protesters while playing tourist on Saturday. \u201cI think it\u2019s very oppressive,\u201d she said of the march atmosphere. \u201cThey can have their day, but I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\u00a0 A protester takes part in the Women\u2019s March on London, as they walk from the American Embassy to Trafalgar Square, in central London, Britain Jan. 21, 2017.&nbsp; Close REUTERS/Neil Hall Rallies were held elsewhere in the U.S., and worldwide. At one in Concord, New Hampshire, author Jodi Picoult said: \u201cWe in New Hampshire are not in the habit of going in reverse. We have the backs of those who are less fortunate - who may be struggling for health care, for environmental rights, for racial equality, for a fair wage, for justice.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In Chicago, so many people turned out for a women\u2019s march there that organizers canceled their plans to march through the city\u2019s downtown, and instead planned to extend the ongoing rally on the city\u2019s lakefront. But the tens of thousands of people who turned out spilled into the city\u2019s downtown streets anyway. After the event concluded in Grant Park, people began flooding nearby streets, chanting and waving signs protesting Mr. Trump. In Paris, thousands marched in the Eiffel Tower neighborhood in a joyful atmosphere, singing and carrying posters reading: \u201cWe have our eyes on you Mr. Trump\u201d and \u201cWith our sisters in Washington.\u201d\u00a0 In Prague, hundreds gathered in Wenceslas Square in freezing weather, waving portraits of Mr. Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and holding banners that read \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d \u2018\u2019Kindness\u201d and \u201cLove.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe are worried about the way some politicians talk, especially during the American elections,\u201d said organizer Johanna Nejedlova.\u00a0 In Copenhagen, Denmark, march organizer Lesley-Ann Brown said: \u201cNationalist, racist and misogynistic trends are growing worldwide and threaten the most marginalized groups in our societies including women, people of color, immigrants, Muslims, the LGBT community and people with disabilities.\u201d In Sydney, thousands of Australians marched in solidarity in Hyde Park. One organizer said hatred, bigotry and racism are not only America\u2019s problems. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters in the German capital carried on signs as they rallied outside the U.S. Embassy in solidarity with the Women\u2019s March in Washington.\u00a0 \u201cMr. Trump, you are no Berliner,\u201d signs said.\u00a0 Other signs included slogans such as \u201cNo to sexism,\u201d \u2018\u2019Women\u2019s rights are human rights,\u201d and \u201cOur bodies, our minds, our power.\u201d One of the protesters is Katie Berdett, an American living in Berlin. She says she fears the loss of women\u2019s rights under Mr. Trump and \u201cfor the democracy of our country.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBut at the same time I\u2019m hopeful because there are so many people standing up and rising up and taking part in these demonstrations,\u201d she said.\u00a0 President John F. Kennedy gave a famous speech in Berlin in 1963 when he said he considered himself \u201ca Berliner\u201d -- a remark that helped keep up morale in the Western part of the then-divided city.\u00a0 People gather in front of the U.S. Embassy on Pariser Platz beside Brandenburg Gate in solidarity with women\u2019s march in Washington and many other marches in several countries, in Berlin, Germany, Jan. 21, 2017.&nbsp; Close REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke The\u00a0 Women\u2019s March on Washington \u00a0was conceived in the late hours of election night, and\u00a0 it all began \u00a0with a frustrated Facebook post by Hawaii grandmother Teresa Shook. \u201cWhat if women marched on Washington around Inauguration Day en masse?\u201d she wrote on her wall. \u00a0 A few hours later, a Facebook event page was created. More and more began clicking the link. As it turns out, Shook was not the only disgruntled voter searching for a new cause.\u00a0 Read more: Meet the women of the Women\u2019s March on Washington Hundreds of groups quickly joined the cause, pushing a wide range of causes, including abortion rights, gun control, climate change and immigrant rights. \u00a0\u00a0 The website of the Women\u2019s March on Washington describes it as \u201ca grassroots effort comprised of dozens of independent coordinators at the state level.\u201d Four national co-chairs helmed the effort and a national coordinating committee worked \u201caround the clock\u201d to pull it together, the website says. info A protester wearing a bra and with a message written on her chest can be seen during the first of hundreds of womens\u2019 marches organized around the world in a show of disapproval of U.S. President Donald Trump in Sydney, Australia, Jan. 21, 2017.&nbsp; Close AAP/Dan Himbrechts/via REUTERS March organizers said women are \u201churting and scared\u201d as the new president takes office and want a greater voice for women in political life.\u00a0 \u201cIn the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights, dignity and justice who have come before us, we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore,\u201d their mission statement says. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 While the march organizers\u2019 \u201cmission and vision\u201d statement never mentions Mr. Trump and stresses broad themes, including the message that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights,\u201d the unifying factor among those turning out appeared to be a loathing for the new president and dismay that so much of the country voted for him. The rallies were a peaceful counterpoint to the window-smashing unrest that unfolded on Friday when self-described anarchists tried to disrupt the inauguration. Police used pepper spray and stun grenades against demonstrators. More than 200 people were arrested. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Karen Pence attend the National Prayer Service at the National Cathedral on Saturday. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images President Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Pence and Karen Pence continued a long inaugural tradition Saturday morning, attending a prayer service that was notable for the diversity of faith participants. While most who led prayers and offered readings at the service at the Washington National Cathedral were overwhelmingly evangelical , the long list of participants also included leaders from the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Jewish, Mormon, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faiths. The service opened with a Navajo blessing. The inaugural prayer service is a tradition that began with President George Washington and was revived in 1933 by President Franklin Roosevelt, continuing ever since. While Trump's team had reportedly asked there be no sermon \u2014 a break with past services \u2014 the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, who's the dean of the Cathedral, was pointed in his prayer by asking God to \"break down the walls that separate us.\" With President Trump in attendance, Dean of Washington National Cathedral prays for God to break down walls, take away arrogance pic.twitter.com/tigM6aikbd \u2014 CNN Religion (@CNNbelief) January 21, 2017 On Friday in a pre-inaugural service at St. John's Church , First Baptist Dallas Pastor Robert Jeffress \u2014 a vocal supporter of Trump throughout his campaign \u2014 preached a sermon that compared Trump to Nehemiah, who had worked to rebuild the crumbling walls around Jerusalem, much like the border wall Trump has proposed. Article continues after sponsorship \"You see, God is not against building walls!\" Jeffress said. Many of the prayers at Saturday's service asked God to provide wisdom and protection for President Trump and the country. A rabbi recited a reading in Hebrew while an imam delivered a prayer in Arabic. Sajid Tarar, a Trump supporter who also prayed at the Republican National Convention, read from the Quran. Trump has stirred up opposition among both faith groups. During the campaign, he proposed a ban on Muslims coming into the country and has talked about a need for surveillance at mosques in order to stop terrorism. And Trump's support among the so-called \"alt-right\" movement of white nationalists has alarmed many in the Jewish community. Several of the songs were patriotic ones, including \"My Country 'Tis Of Thee\" and \"America the Beautiful,\" and a choir from Liberty University, whose president Jerry Falwell Jr. was also a vocal Trump supporter, sang \"We've Come This Far By Faith.\" President Trump's children and their families were also in attendance, including Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, a new White House adviser to Trump. The couple and their children are Orthodox Jews. Notable participants included Alveda King, an anti-abortion activist who is the niece of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Cissie Graham Lynch, the granddaughter of evangelist Billy Graham whose father Franklin Graham prayed during the inauguration ceremony.

Six-hundred \"sister marches\" were planned outside of Washington, D.C., where a major procession moved toward the Washington Monument and the White House on President Donald Trump's first full day in office. Related: Women's March Brings Flood of Pink Hats, Fiery Rhetoric Organizers of the Women's March on Washington said the street demonstrations were scheduled for the day after the presidential inauguration as a direct response to the election of Trump, whose stances on abortion, immigration, climate change and health care have troubled participants. An estimated 3 million people have marched worldwide, including in London, Berlin and Tokyo, according to organizers. Here are some of the demonstrations throughout the world: New York City Over 100,000 people were estimated to be marching through Manhattan, with a final stop along Fifth Avenue toward Trump Tower.
