The doormats caused a diplomatic uproar in India after they appeared on the Amazon site. Some viewed walking on the flag as insulting the national symbol, a crime in India. Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted Wednesday that if Amazon did not \u201cwithdraw all products insulting our national flag immediately\u201d and \u201ctender unconditional apology,\u201d India would not grant a visa to \"any Amazon official\" and would rescind previously issued visas.

Immediately after this thrill ride of a Cubs season ends, some heavy-duty construction will commence again at Wrigley Field that will make the Friendly Confines that much friendlier \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 to fans with season tickets behind home plate. As part of the 1060 Project, an overhaul to... (Chris Kuc) And though baseball is more often associated with beer, hard liquor is increasingly finding a home in major league ballparks, a trend that reflects both the growth of the spirits industry and increasing consumer desire for more \"premium\" choices, said Hermeling, who previously worked for the Washington Nationals and Washington Redskins. \"This new generation of consumers values choices,\" Hermeling said. Beam Suntory brands such as Jim Beam, Maker's Mark, EFFEN Vodka and Hornitos tequila will be featured at Wrigley as part of the sponsorship. Other facets of the arrangement also include: \u2022The new first base club, which likely will incorporate some Prohibition-era historical elements, Hermeling said. Details are scant at this point. \u2022The Hornitos Hacienda in the left field bleachers, which is part of a previous agreement between Beam and the Cubs. The feature will remain and include more Beam Suntory brands. Cubs-branded Makers Mark Cubs fans can buy Makers Mark whiskey with a wax seal celebrating the Cubs. Cubs fans can buy Makers Mark whiskey with a wax seal celebrating the Cubs. (Handout) \u2022Cubs-branded Maker's Mark, which is already in stores in the Chicago area. Next up: Cubs-branded Jim Beam this spring. \u2022New promotional events like Brunch at the Ballpark, which will feature mimosas and Bloody Marys at Sunday home games this season. Such marketing deals generally don't boost sales right away but are considered longer-term investments to build and change perceptions about brands, said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. \"This particular deal makes a lot of sense for Beam Suntory. ... Ultimately, this can help recruit people and lead to other partnerships in the city,\" Calkins said. Beam Suntory's Shattock pointed to other recent efforts to connect with Chicagoans, such as covering the cost of 10,000 Uber rides during a Cubs World Series home game. Asked whether there might be a future sponsorship deal with the White Sox , he said the company was committed to the Cubs at this point. Beam Suntory is a privately held subsidiary of Japan's Suntory Holdings. Suntory bought Beam in April 2014 for about $16 billion. Might there someday be Japanese whisky poured at Wrigley Field? \"Never say never,\" Shattock said. Beam Suntory will be 11th legacy partner of the Cubs. The others are Advocate Health Care, American Airlines, Anheuser-Busch, ATI Physical Therapy, Nuveen, Sloan Valve Co., Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Toyota, Under Armour and Wintrust. gtrotter@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "Obama announces end to 'wet foot, dry foot' policy for Cuban refugees Published               January 12, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print March 22, 2016: President Barack Obama speaks at the Grand Theater of Havana, Cuba. \u00a0(AP Photo/Desmond Boylan, File) President Barack Obama announced Thursday that he was ending a longstanding immigration policy that allowed any Cuban who made it to U.S. soil to stay and become a legal resident. In a statement, Obama said the so-called \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy was \"designed for a different era\" of U.S.-Cuba relations.\u00a0 Under the new policy, which takes effect immediately, Cubans who attempt to enter the U.S. illegally without qualifying for humanitarian relief will be sent back to the island. \"By taking this step,\" Obama said, \"we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries.\" Obama added that the Havana government had agreed to accept Cubans ordered to leave the U.S., a concession that was a focus of months of negotiations. A senior administration official told the Associated Press the Cubans gave no assurances about treatment of those sent back to the country, but said political asylum remains an option for those concerned about persecution if they return. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the move \"goes a long way to putting our relationship with Cuba on equal terms with our relationships with other neighbors.\" Obama is using an administrative rule change to end the policy. President-elect Donald Trump could undo that rule after he is sworn in next week. He has criticized Obama's moves to improve relations with Cuba. But ending a policy that has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to come to the United States without a visa also aligns with Trump's commitment to tough immigration policies. The \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy was put in place in 1995 by then-President Bill Clinton as a revision of a more liberal immigration policy. Until then, Cubans caught at sea trying to make their way to the United States were allowed into the country and were able to become legal residents after a year. The U.S. was reluctant to send people back to the communist island then run by Fidel Castro, and the Cuban government also generally refused to accept repatriated citizens. The Cuban government has in the past complained bitterly about the special immigration privileges, saying they encourage Cubans to risk dangerous escape trips and drain the country of professionals. But it has also served as a release valve for the single-party state, allowing the most dissatisfied Cubans to seek better lives outside and become sources of financial support for relatives on the island. Relations between the United States and Cuba were stuck in a Cold War freeze for decades, but Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro established full diplomatic ties and opened embassies in their capitals in 2015. Obama visited Havana last March. U.S. and Cuban officials were meeting Thursday in Washington to coordinate efforts to fight human trafficking. A decades-old U.S. economic embargo, though, remains in place as does the Cuban Adjustment Act which lets Cubans become permanent residents a year after legally arriving in the U.S. The official said that in recent years, most people fleeing the island have done so for economic reasons or to take advantage of the benefits they know they can receive if they make it to the U.S. The official also cited an uptick in Cuban migration, particularly across the U.S.-Mexico border -- an increase the official said reflected an expectation among Cubans that the Obama administration would soon move to end their special immigration status. Since October 2012, more than 118,000 Cubans have presented themselves at ports of entry along the border, according to statistics published by the Homeland Security Department. During the 2016 budget year, which ended in September, a five-year high of more than 41,500 people came through the southern border. An additional 7,000 people arrived between October and November. The influx has created burdens on other countries in the region that must contend with Cubans who have yet to reach the U.S. border, the official said. The Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, which was started by President George W. Bush in 2006, is also being rescinded. The measure allowed Cuban doctors, nurses and other medical professionals to seek parole in the U.S. while on assignments abroad. People already in the pipeline under both \"wet foot, dry foot\" and the medical parole program will be able to continue the process toward getting legal status. The preferential treatment for Cubans reflected the political power of Cuban-Americans, especially in Florida, a critical state in presidential elections. That has been shifting in recent years. Older Cubans, particularly those who fled Castro's regime, tend to reject Obama's diplomatic overtures to Cuba. Younger Cuban-American voters have proven less likely than their parents and grandparents to define their politics by U.S.-Cuba relations. Exit polls show President Barack Obama managed roughly a split in the Florida Cuban vote in 2012, and Trump in November won the same group by a much narrower margin than many previous Republican nominees.

    "text": "By KAREN YOURISH and LARRY BUCHANAN JAN. 12, 2017 Ethics experts rebutted key parts of Donald J. Trump\u2019s plan to address conflicts of interest hours after the plan was presented by Sheri A. Dillon, a lawyer for the Trump Organization. Sheri A. Dillon Speaking at Trump Tower on Jan. 11 on the Trump Organization\u2019s efforts to avoid conflicts of interest Good morning. It\u2019s my honor and privilege to be here today at president-elect Trump\u2019s request. He\u2019s asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he\u2019s taking. As you know, the business empire built by president-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned. \u201cTragically, the Trump plan to deal with his business conflicts announced today falls short in every respect.\u201d Norman Eisen, former chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama, and Richard W. Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush President-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people\u2019s business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company. \u201cStepping back from running his business is meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective. The presidency is a full-time job and he would\u2019ve had to step back anyway.\u201d Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests. As he said, he\u2019s voluntarily taking this on. The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets. The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it\u2019s simply inapplicable by its terms. And this is not just our interpretation. It\u2019s Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president. \u201cThe emoluments clause applies to the president. It is rooted in the concern of the founders of this country that foreign governments would try to meddle in American politics. What\u2019s the point of having the Tea Party and throwing King George\u2019s tea into Boston Harbor if you\u2019re then going to elect a president who\u2019s buying and selling tea with King George or any other foreign power?\u201d Mr. Painter Even so, president-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law. \u201cTrump did not follow the example of his nominees and of every president for the past four decades in using a blind trust arrangement, or the equivalent, to cleanly sever himself from his business interests. And in President-elect Trump\u2019s case it\u2019s an even more problematic situation because he\u2019s receiving foreign government payments and other benefits and things of value that\u2019s expressly prohibited by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Mr. Eisen Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W. Bush\u2019s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center. Mr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He\u2019s here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump Organization. I\u2019m gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking. First, president-elect Trump\u2019s investments and business assets commonly known as the \u2014 as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th. Here is just some of the paperwork that\u2019s taking care of those actions. \u201cThe idea of setting up a trust to hold his operating businesses adds nothing to the equation. This is not a blind trust \u2014 it\u2019s not even close.\u201d Mr. Shaub Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump. \u201cHis sons are still running the businesses and, of course, he knows what he owns.\u201d Mr. Shaub Further, at the president-elect\u2019s direction, the trust agreement provides \u2014 that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns. President-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump Organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency. President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities. Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will be focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools. The president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics. \u201cI was especially troubled by the statement that the incoming administration is going to demand that OGE approve a diversified portfolio of assets. No one has ever talked to us about that idea, and there\u2019s no legal mechanism to do that.\u201d Mr. Shaub Second, the trust is going to hold his pre-existing illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from pre-existing licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust. Through instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric. The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cThe notion that there won\u2019t be new deals doesn\u2019t solve the problem of all the existing deals and businesses.\u201d Mr. Shaub New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process. The president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could \u2014 and I emphasize could \u2014 be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t happen with a blind trust.\u201d Mr. Shaub The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval. To further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting. \u201cThe idea of limiting direct communication about the business is wholly inadequate. That\u2019s not how a blind trust works. There\u2019s not supposed to be any information at all.\u201d Mr. Shaub Another step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization: the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency. He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump\u2019s role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency. In sum, all of these actions \u2014 complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights \u2014 will sever President-elect Trump\u2019s presidency from the Trump Organization. Some have asked questions. Why not divest? Why not just sell everything? Form a blind trust. And I\u2019d like to turn to addressing some of those questions now. \u201cAs I said, every president in modern times has taken the strong medicine of divestiture . . . Officials in any administration need their president to show ethics matters, not only through words but also through deeds.\u201d Mr. Shaub Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization\u2019s assets. If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency. Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect. And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale. \u201cI wish she had spoken with those of us in the government who do this for a living. We would have reassured her that presidential nominees in every administration agree to sell illiquid assets all the time.\u201d Mr. Shaub President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn\u2019t even feasible. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that the president is now entering the world of public service. He\u2019s going to be asking his own appointees to make sacrifices. He\u2019s going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts around the world. So, no, I don\u2019t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States of America.\u201d Mr. Shaub Some people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now. Some people have suggested that the Trump \u2014 that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter. It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization. Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. \u201cThe president-elect\u2019s attorney justified the decision not to use a blind trust by saying that you can\u2019t put operating businesses in a blind trust. She\u2019s right about that. That\u2019s why the decision to set up this strange new kind of trust is so perplexing.\u201d Mr. Shaub President Trump can\u2019t unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized. Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump \u2014 it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal. \u201cNothing short of divestiture will resolve these conflicts.\u201d Mr. Shaub I\u2019m going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That\u2019s a word I think we\u2019ve all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before. \u201cThis is not an obscure provision of the Constitution.\u201d Mr. Painter And we\u2019re gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. Emoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says \u201cofficials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.\u201d The so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Congress is going to allow these emoluments to flow unchecked.\u201d Mr. Eisen No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument. But since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm\u2019s-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn\u2019t even aware of. These people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It\u2019s not an emolument. The Constitution does not require president-elect Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires. So, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit. \u201cIt is not my view, nor the view of any of the bipartisan experts that have spoken out today, that the announced Trump plan is sufficient to cure his emoluments problem. Even if it were possible to peal out the profits only from the hotel, the emoluments clause is not written to say that all emoluments are permitted except for Trump hotel profits.\u201d Mr. Eisen In sum, I and president-elect\u2019s (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we\u2019ve outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family. We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect\u2019s desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure. \u201cThe plan we heard today does not comply with the law. He is not in violation of the law as of today, but he has nine days to fix it. And these emoluments, these payments from foreign governments, have to be out of the Trump business empire on Jan. 20 or he will be in violation of the law. It is not an obscure provision of the Constitution. It was intended to preserve the independence of the United States from foreign powers meddling in our system.\u201d Mr. Painter The American people were well \u2014 well aware of President-elect Trump\u2019s business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success. President-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you.

    "text": "Chargers make it official: They're moving to Los Angeles The Chargers are moving to Los Angeles The Chargers are leaving San Diego for Los Angeles. Owner Dean Spanos announced the decision in a letter posted on the team\u2019s website Jan. 12. (Jan. 12, 2017) The Chargers are leaving San Diego for Los Angeles. Owner Dean Spanos announced the decision in a letter posted on the team\u2019s website Jan. 12. (Jan. 12, 2017) Sam Farmer and Nathan Fenno Contact Reporters The Chargers are leaving San Diego for Los Angeles, owner Dean Spanos announced Thursday in a letter posted on the team\u2019s website. \u201cAfter much deliberation, I have made the decision to relocate the Chargers to Los Angeles beginning with the 2017 season,\u201d Spanos wrote. \u201cSan Diego has been our home for 56 years. It will always be a part of our identity, and my family and I have nothing but gratitude and appreciation for the support and passion our fans have shared for us over the years. \u201cBut today, we turn the page and begin an exciting new era as the Los Angeles Chargers.\u201d Spanos \u2014 who didn\u2019t need approval from the other NFL team owners for the move \u2014 arrived at L.A. International Airport at 9:46 a.m after a 21-minute flight from San Diego in a private jet and began a daylong tour of his team's new home. \"Getting a whole company moved up here by June or July, that's huge in itself logistically, but we have a great plan in place,\" Spanos said in a phone interview with The Times. The move didn't go as the NFL planned. A day earlier, the league moved a Sunday deadline for the Chargers to exercise their option to relocate to Tuesday so as not to conflict with playoff games or the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. That provided a glimmer of hope to San Diego fans that a solution might be at hand. Read the letter from Chargers owner Dean Spanos announcing the move to L.A. Open link However, no last-ditch effort by the NFL to persuade Spanos to remain in San Diego materialized when the league's stadium and finance committees met Wednesday at league headquarters in New York. Spanos subsequently called NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and several owners Wednesday to inform them he was moving the team to L.A. \"I wasn't expecting anything [of the meeting],\" Spanos said. After the NFL\u2019s two-decade absence from L.A., the league took the unprecedented step of allowing the Chargers and Rams to return to the nation\u2019s second-largest market in the space of a year. Though NFL owners have remained adamant in public that L.A. can support two teams, some have expressed reservations in private about how enthusiastically the city will embrace two franchises that have struggled on the field in recent years. The drawn-out decision-making has tested the patience of NFL owners and agonized a San Diego fan base that has cheered the team since its arrival from Los Angeles in 1961. In a statement, Goodell said the Chargers \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d\u00a0to find a stadium solution in San Diego. \u201cRelocation is painful for teams and communities,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cIt is especially painful for fans, and the fans in San Diego have given the Chargers strong and loyal support for more than 50 years, which makes it even more disappointing that we could not solve the stadium issue.\u201d The Chargers have unsuccessfully sought a new stadium in and around San Diego for the last decade and a half. They wanted to replace the aging Qualcomm Stadium \u2014 built in 1967 and widely considered one of the NFL\u2019s worst venues \u2014 but a series of proposals failed for reasons that included the city\u2019s fiscal crisis, an inability to garner political support, site issues and little appetite for public financing. The 120-mile move north is expected to dramatically increase the value of the Chargers; Forbes estimated that the Rams are worth nearly $1.5 billion more after leaving St. Louis last year. But the Chargers will owe a $650-million relocation fee to be split among the league\u2019s other owners. The team will have 10 years to pay, beginning when the new stadium opens. That\u2019s expected to be in 2019. An artist's rendering of the proposed NFL\u00a0stadium in Inglewood. The decision allows the Rams to start selling personal seat licenses, suites and naming rights for owner Stan Kroenke\u2019s $2.6-billion stadium at the site of the old Hollywood Park racetrack. The Chargers, who will pay $1 a year as a tenant, will help finance the project with a $200-million NFL loan and the proceeds from sales of personal seat licenses. They\u2019ll also contribute an additional 10 events a year to the 298-acre sports and entertainment district, where plans call for hundreds of thousands of square feet for office space, retail and housing around the glass-roofed stadium. \u201cWe are effusively happy that the Chargers made the difficult decision to come and join the Rams in Inglewood,\u201d\u00a0said James T. Butts Jr., the city\u2019s mayor. \u201cWe welcome them with open arms.\u201d Butts is expected to meet with Spanos in Inglewood on Thursday. Until the stadium is complete, the Chargers will play at StubHub Center in Carson. The 30,000-seat venue is a nontraditional option. The Chargers held their training camp at the facility on the campus of Cal State Dominguez Hills in 2003 and 2004. By charging more for an up-close, premium experience, team officials believe they can make up the revenue difference from what they could expect from a much larger stadium. Before making the final attempt to build a stadium in downtown San Diego, the Chargers joined forces with the Oakland Raiders in hopes of building a stadium in Carson. They even brought on Disney Chairman and CEO Robert Iger to oversee the project. However, NFL owners chose the Inglewood plan by a 30-2 vote last January. Goodell called it \u201ctransformational.\u201d As part of the vote, however, owners awarded the Chargers the L.A. option. If they didn\u2019t use it, the option would transfer to the Raiders. They\u2019re pursuing a stadium in Las Vegas \u2014 bolstered by $750 million in public financing approved by Nevada\u2019s Legislature last year \u2014 but retain a large and passionate fan base in Southern California. Last January, the Chargers announced plans for a temporary facility in Santa Ana and agreed in principle on a lease with the Rams to share the Inglewood stadium. On Jan. 29, they said they would play the 2016 season in San Diego. The Chargers turned their attention to a combined stadium and convention center in San Diego. The NFL and the team pledged $650 million toward the project. A November ballot initiative on the project received a 43% favorable vote, when two-thirds was needed to proceed. The team said it spent more than $10 million on the failed initiative. In the aftermath, Chargers officials believed that any public financing from the city or county would be subject to a vote that would be unlikely to take place until November 2018 at the earliest. Coming off a season with the second-worst home attendance in the NFL, they were loath\u00a0to spend two more years as a lame-duck franchise with no guarantee that voters would greenlight funding for a stadium. \u201cThe Chargers will stand next to Donald Sterling in the Hall of Shame,\u201d\u00a0San Diego County Supervisor Ron Roberts said in a tweet Thursday, invoking the former Clippers owner who moved the team from San Diego to L.A. in 1984. \u201cIt hurts, but we will move on.\u201d Last month, the Chargers agreed to lease space for a temporary headquarters in Costa Mesa, but they are searching for a permanent location. Last January, the Chargers applied to trademark the \u201cLos Angeles Chargers\u201d and \u201cLA Chargers\u201d names. When the Chargers posted the letter from Spanos at 8 a.m. Thursday, they also unveiled a new logo \u2014 a stylized \u201cLA\u201d\u2019 that incorporates a lightning bolt.

The report \"is a ridiculous thing, nothing else ... it does not contain any proofs, any evidence,\" Peskov said. Related: Intelligence Chief Clapper to Trump: Russia Memo Wasn't Leaked by Us Trump had for weeks refused to publicly accept the U.S. intelligence agencies' findings that Russia directed the hacking of Democratic National Committee computer files in order to meddle in the election. But for the first time Wednesday, Trump told reporters that he accepted that assessment. Peskov said Trump is \"definitely wrong\" for changing his tune. But Trump lambasted as \"fake news\" an unverified dossier, which is not an intelligence document and was widely shared online, claiming that the Russian government had compromising information about the president-elect. The dossier was written by a former British spy on behalf of Republican opponents of Trump's but was later shopped to the media by Democrats. Play ",

(Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) Amanda Marrazzo and Robert McCoppin Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Outside the town house with the boarded-up door, three teenage boys added a rosary and Christian medallion to a growing memorial of stuffed animals, candles and balloons. \"We wanted to show our respect,\" William Weck, 13, said Wednesday afternoon as a cold drizzle fell. Another nearby resident, Kelly Klein, said her two daughters were having a hard time with the news: two children and their mother had been found dead in the Lake in the Hills home the previous day in what authorities said appeared to be a double murder-suicide. A couple hours later, the news took another grim turn: Authorities announced their findings that the children, Ezequiel Garcia, 11, and his sister Ariana, 8 had been strangled, and that their mother, Carla Lopez-Mejia, 27, had then hanged herself. \"It is so heartbreaking,\" Klein said. \"It brings tears to my eyes as a mom who is supposed to protect her children.\" Police in the small McHenry County community said they were called to the town house along Daybreak Drive at about 3 p.m Tuesday, where first-responders found the remains. Janaya Simmons, who lives in an adjoining town house, said her daughter normally rode the school bus with Ariana but that she didn't show up Tuesday. Simmons called the Garcia children \"full of energy\" and said they liked to play outside no matter the weather. She recalled that, after a recent snowfall, her daughter built an igloo with Ariana and Ezequiel, whom Simmons called \"Ezzie.\" Neighbor Janaya Simmons and her daughter Anarri visit a memorial Jan. 11, 2017,\u00a0outside the Lake in the Hills home where Carla Lopez-Mejia, 27, and her children Ariana Garcia, 8, and Ezequiel Garcia, 11, were found dead\u00a0the previous day. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) Anthony Romano, 14, another neighborhood boy, said the Garcia children \"were very happy.\" Simmons said she saw police outside the neighbors' town house Tuesday and later saw the children's father, as well as Lopez-Mejia's mother and brother, outside the home appearing distraught. \"Whatever happened is a tragedy. ... I really feel bad for the kids because they really didn't deserve that,\" she said. \"It's just a sad day here in Lake in the Hills.\" Ezequiel was in sixth grade at Marlowe Middle School and Ariana was a third-grader at Martin Elementary School. Both buildings are located at Reed Road Campus, which can be seen from the town house complex where the children lived. Huntley Community School District 158 posted a statement Wednesday of condolence to the family. Spokesman Dan Armstrong said parents of the Garcia children's classmates were notified directly to allow them the chance to talk to their children. The two school principals also spoke directly to the Garcia children's classmates and counselors were made available. 3 found dead in Lake in the Hills Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune A boarded-up door is the only sign of something amiss at a town home in\u00a0the 2300 block of Daybreak Drive in Lake in the Hills on Jan. 11, 2017. A boarded-up door is the only sign of something amiss at a town home in\u00a0the 2300 block of Daybreak Drive in Lake in the Hills on Jan. 11, 2017. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) \"This terrible tragedy has affected all of us in the Huntley 158 family, and the grief that accompanies news such as this will take time to process as students, staff, and the community all attempt to come to terms with it,\" said the online statement from Superintendent John Burkey. \"Students will respond to this tragedy in different ways, and it is important for both schools and families to support them. Any reaction is normal in the grieving process and can range from withdrawal to crying to anger. It's important for us as adults to listen carefully to our children and help them through their reactions and feelings regarding this tragedy,\" the statement said. There were few immediate clues to suggest what might have led to the gruesome turn of events. Neighbors said Lopez-Mejia was quieter and less sociable than her children's father. A Facebook page appearing to be hers said she had studied at McHenry County College. Posts included inspirational quotes from Nelson Mandela: \"It always seems impossible until it's done,\" and \"May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.\" Another post read: \"I have a past, but I don't live there anymore.\" Last June, Lopez-Mejia filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to address unpaid debts, and her case was closed by September, records indicate. While debt is stressful, her attorney, Steve Costello, said his clients are usually happy to get it resolved. \"We were all scratching our heads as to why something like this would happen,\" he said. \"She seemed very nice and generally happy.\" Mark La Ferlita, 18, lives across the street from the family and said he often saw Ariana playing with her cat. \"She was nice ... a sweet kid,\" he said. \"They were cute kids, so sweet, real respectful.\" La Ferlita said he was \"shocked\" when he saw all the commotion Tuesday night and police breaking down the door. He said such events \"don't happen around here.\" \"I'm sad,\" he said. \"I always took for granted them being here, seeing them outside.\" La Ferlita said it was hard to understand what happened. \"That's your family,\" he said. \"That is something you have to cherish.\" Amanda Marrazzo is a freelance reporter, and Robert McCoppin is a Tribune reporter.

USA TODAY Sports Washington Redskins offensive coordinator Sean McVay stands on the field prior to the Redskins' game against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports) The Los Angeles Rams made NFL history with their coaching hire on Thursday. In being named to the Rams' top job, former Washington Redskins offensive coordinator Sean McVay, 30, becomes the youngest coach to ever lead a team. Former Oakland Raiders coach Lane Kiffin, who was appointed to the position at 31 in 2007, was the previous holder of the title. McVay turns 31 on Jan. 24. The Rams' deal with McVay is for five years, a person with knowledge of the contract told USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because terms had not been made public. McVay helped Washington finish with the No. 3 overall offense this season, his third as coordinator. \"This is an exciting day for the Los Angeles Rams as we welcome Sean McVay as our new head coach,\" Rams owner Stan Kroenke said in a release. \"The accomplishments and success that he has rendered in less than a decade in our league are remarkable. I am confident in his vision to make this team a consistent winner and to ultimately bring a Super Bowl title home to Los Angeles.\" In Los Angeles, McVay will be faced with rebuilding an offense that ranked last in the NFL in each of the past two seasons. The Rams finished 4-12 and are without their first-round draft pick after trading up last year to select quarterback Jared Goff with the No. 1 overall pick. McVay will have some veteran held on his staff, as Wade Phillips is joining the team as the defensive coordinator on a lucrative three-year deal, a person familiar with the move told USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero. The person spoke on condition of anoymity because the move had not been announced. Phillips previously led the Denver Broncos' defense, which finished fourth this season and first in its Super Bowl-winning 2015 campaign. 1175 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.

The assignment came in a required \u201cadult roles and financial literacy class\u201d on Monday,\u00a0 FOX13 reported. Some of the bullet points for girls said things like \u201cdon\u2019t waste his money,\u201d \u201cif you think you\u2019re fat keep it to yourself,\u201d \u201cbe feminine and lady like\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t correct his personal habits.\u201d Boys were told to inform their dates about what they planned to order so the girls would \u201chave a guide in order,\u201d and to not \u201cgripe about the money you\u2019re spending or don\u2019t have.\u201d Jenn Oxborrow, whose daughter was in the class, said the assignment \u201cblew me out of the water.\u201d Oxborrow said the assignment went too far and that the assignment represented old-school thinking. She said her daughter was frustrated and upset. TEEN ACCUSED OF BEING FAKE DOCTOR INDICTED IN VIRGINIA \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe some of the questions and guidelines,\u201d she told FOX13. \u201cThe whole premise of the assignment was ridiculous.\u201d She added that her daughter \u201csent me a picture of it immediately when she got it and said 'I\u2019m pretty frustrated with this. I\u2019m upset. I think it's unfair and I\u2019m worried about some of my classmates that might not identify with traditional gender roles.'\u201d The assignment appeared on a statewide website where teachers could download quizzes, lesson plans and assignments for use in their classrooms, FOX13 added. \u201cWe found it, we have deleted it from the website and are looking into how it got there so we don\u2019t repeat the same mistake again,\u201d Mark Peterson, Public Relations Director for the Utah State Board of Education, told the station. \u201cWe really don't have business whether or not boys and girls should be kissing on a date in a financial literacy class.\u201d Highland High School\u2019s principal has not commented. School district officials said they spoke to the teacher, who was said to have been mortified and regretted any harm she may have caused, FOX13 reported. PASTOR'S TEENAGE DAUGHTER WHO WAS MISSING FOR DAYS FOUND ALIVE Oxborrow, who complained to the school district, said she was glad the assignment was removed, but was worried about the students in the class \u2013 especially those who identify by another gender or are attracted to someone of the same sex. \u201cWe're a state that has such a high rate of teen suicide and so many issues in regards to gender identity can cause depression for teenagers. I was really sad once I thought about it,\u201d Oxborrow said. ",

    "text": "By Matt Zapotosky and Sari Horwitz January 12 at 6:22 PM Follow @mattzap Follow @sarihorwitz The Washington Post's Matt Zapotosky explains why the Department of Justice is opening a new inquiry into FBI Director James B. Comey and how he handled the probe of Hillary Clinton's email practices. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The Justice Department inspector general will review broad allegations of misconduct involving FBI Director James B. Comey and how he handled the probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices, the inspector general announced Thursday. The investigation will be wide ranging \u2014 encompassing Comey\u2019s various letters and public statements on the matter and whether FBI or other Justice Department employees leaked nonpublic information, according to Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz. The inspector general\u2019s announcement drew praise from those on both sides of the political aisle, for different reasons, and once again put Comey on the hot-seat. Democrats and Clinton herself have blamed Comey for the Democratic candidate\u2019s loss, arguing that\u00a0the renewed inquiry and the FBI director\u2019s public missives on the eve of the election blunted her momentum. Comey also has been criticized for months by former Justice officials for violating the department\u2019s policy of avoiding any action that could affect a candidate close to an election. President-elect Donald Trump has notably declined to commit to keeping the FBI Director . Brian Fallon, a former Clinton campaign spokesman, praised the investigation Thursday. \u201cThis is highly encouraging and to be expected given Director Comey\u2019s drastic deviation from Justice Department protocol,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cA probe of this sort, however long it takes to conduct, is utterly necessary in order to take the first step to restore the FBI\u2019s reputation as a non-partisan institution.\u201d Lawmakers and others had called previously for the inspector general to probe the FBI\u2019s pre-election actions when it came to the Clinton probe, alleging that Comey bucked long-standing policies with his communications about the case and that information seemed to have leaked inappropriately \u2014 perhaps to former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Trump supporter. [ The attorney general could have ordered FBI Director James Comey not to send his bombshell letter on Clinton emails. Here\u2019s why she didn\u2019t. ] Horowitz said in a news release that he will explore the circumstances surrounding the actions of Comey and others, though he will not re-litigate whether anyone should have faced charges. \u201cThe review will not substitute the OIG\u2019s judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions,\u201d the news release said, using an acronym for the Office of the Inspector General. In a statement, Comey said: \u201cI am grateful to the Department of Justice\u2019s IG for taking on this review. He is professional and independent and the FBI will cooperate fully with him and his office. I hope very much he is able to share his conclusions and observations with the public because everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency regarding this matter.\u201d The FBI\u2019s probe into whether Clinton mishandled classified information by using a private email server when she was secretary of state has long been controversial and politically charged. Perhaps most notably, Comey on Oct. 28 \u2014 after previously announcing publicly that he was recommending no charges in the case \u2014 sent a letter to congressional leaders telling them that agents had resumed the Clinton probe after finding potentially relevant information in an unrelated case \u2014 the investigation of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The day before, senior Justice Department leaders had warned Comey not to send the letter, because it violated two long-standing department policies \u2014 discussing an ongoing investigation and taking any overt action on an investigation so close to an election. At the time, it was less than two weeks before the election, and early voting had already begun. Conversely, Comey has notably declined to talk about any possible investigations of President-elect Donald Trump or his campaign, as recently as this week rebuffing requests from legislators to confirm agents were looking into any such matters. That has drawn charges of hypocrisy from Democrats, though it is in line with normal practices. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014especially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny a pending investigation,\u201d Comey said this week. The Inspector General did not say he would investigate Comey\u2019s comments on Trump or any matters related to Russian interference in the election. Comey sent a second letter to Congress on the Clinton case, just days before the election, declaring that the investigation was complete and he was not changing the decision he had made in July to recommend no charges. But the damage \u2014 in the minds of Clinton supporters, at least \u2014 had been done. Horowitz wrote that he will explore \u201callegations that Department or FBI policies or procedures were not followed\u201d in connection with both letters. When he is finished, his office will likely issue a lengthy report detailing what it has found, as it has done in other high-profile matters, though it is also possible he could recommend criminal charges for anyone found to have broken the law. The probe could take a significant amount of time. Deputy Inspector General Robert P. Storch declined to comment for this story. Horowitz wrote that his inquiry would extend back to at least July \u2014 when Comey announced he was recommending the Clinton case be closed without charges.\u00a0He wrote that he would explore \u201callegations that Department and FBI employees improperly disclosed non-public information\u201d \u2014 potentially a reference to Giuliani, who seemed to claim at one point he had insider FBI knowledge . Horowitz also wrote that he would explore whether FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe should have been recused\u00a0from the case. McCabe\u2019s wife, ran for a Virginia senate seat and took money from the PAC of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe , a fierce Clinton ally. Efforts to reach McCabe were not immediately successful. Giuliani has previously said he would cooperate with an inspector general investigation, though he said he had talked to only former FBI officials and was not the recipient of any leaks. He did not return a message Thursday. Reps. John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) and Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who called for the inspector general related to Giuliani, said in a joint statement: \u201cOur citizens must be able to trust that the FBI, our chief federal law enforcement agency, is non-partisan and does not insert itself into the electoral process.\u00a0 We are pleased that the Inspector General is following up on our request to investigate and review these allegations and look forward to receiving a full review of these matters.\u201d Horowitz wrote that he would delve more deeply into the FBI\u00a0 publishing, just days before the election, 129 pages of internal documents from a years-old probe into former president Bill Clinton\u2019s pardon of a fugitive Democratic donor. And he said he would also probe whether Peter Kadzik, the Justice Department\u2019s\u00a0Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs \u201cimproperly disclosed non-public information to the Clinton campaign and/or should have been recused from participating in certain matters.\u201d Kadzik used to be the lawyer for Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and Wikileaks released hacked emails showing communications between the two men about the State Department\u2019s review of Clinton emails for Freedom of Information Act purposes. In an interview, Kadzik, who said he was speaking in his personal capacity, called the inspector general\u2019s investigation \u201cdisheartening.\u201d He noted the information he gave Podesta about a hearing and a court document already was public, and it came before the FBI opened its criminal investigation. Of whether he should have recused himself from any involvement in that criminal probe, Kadzik said: \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I had any decision making authority or role in the criminal investigation. I wasn\u2019t involved in the criminal investigation. There was nothing to recuse myself from.\u201d His job, he said, was to transmit information to Congress, and even then, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m making a decision on what to give or not to give with respect to that, particularly with respect to a criminal investigation like the Clinton investigation. \u201d Kadzik declined to say whether he would cooperate with the Inspector General probe. \u201cMy answer is, I wish the Inspector General would have talked to me first,\u201d he said. Virtually all of the matters being probed are well-publicized controversies, and in some cases, the FBI has defended its actions. In the case of McCabe, for example, the deputy director\u2019s wife, physician Jill McCabe, was recruited to run for a Virginia state senate seat, and took more than $450,000 from a McAuliffe PAC. At the time news of the donations broke, Trump, then just a candidate for president, called the development\u00a0\u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d and claimed, \u201cwe\u2019ve never had a thing like this in the history of our country.\u201d The FBI, though, asserted at the time that McCabe had checked in with ethics officials and followed agency protocols. And, when his wife was first recruited to run, he was not yet deputy director. He was elevated to that post in February 2016, after his wife was out of politics. The FBI, too, has previously stood by its handling of the release of documents related to the Marc Rich pardon. The bureau dumped the documents onto a records website on Nov. 1 \u2014 just days before the election \u2014 and announced it had done so on Twitter. The bureau said it did so in response to records requests, and the tweet was sent because of updates to an automated system. The timing generated significant controversy, though, and someone complained to the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility. An FBI spokesman said at the time he had been in touch with the office\u2019s director, and it was \u201cunlikely\u201d an investigation would be launched. Now,\u00a0the inspector general will look into the matter. Notably absent from the list of matters being considered is Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s controversial meeting in June with former president Bill Clinton aboard her plane on the tarmac of the Phoenix, Airport. The half-hour conversation, which Lynch has said she regrets, created the appearance that the attorney general was politically compromised. Some officials say it left a leadership vacuum and likely prompted Comey to give his\u00a0controversial July press conference, at which he announced he was recommending no charges for Clinton but criticized her and her aides as \u201cextremely careless.\u201d The tarmac meeting could be encompassed in the investigation of possible leaks of information, and Horowitz wrote that his investigators would consider \u201cother issues that may arise during the course of the review.\u201d But Horowitz\u00a0specifically referenced the dates of Comey\u2019s letters and his press conference as parts of his investigation. He did not mention Bill Clinton or Lynch, who have both asserted that their conversation was not about the Clinton email case. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, took note of the omission. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear that the Inspector General agreed to my request to look at multiple concerns that I raised throughout the investigation,\u201d Grassley said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cConspicuously absent, though, is any specific reference to the Attorney General\u2019s failure to recuse herself from the probe, particularly after her meeting with former President Clinton.\u00a0 It\u2019s in the public interest to provide a full accounting of all the facts that led to the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s decision-making regarding the investigation.\u201d Anne Gearan and Karen DeYoung contributed to this report. national ",

    "text": "CBS/AP January 12, 2017, 8:02 AM Baltimore house fire kills 6 children from same family Two children are transported in a gurney after a house fire in Baltimore on Jan 12, 2017. WJZ-TV Email Last Updated Jan 12, 2017 4:07 PM EST BALTIMORE -- Six children were killed in a fire at a home in northeast Baltimore Thursday morning. The children\u2019s mother and three other children survived the fire, but were hospitalized, fire department spokesman Chief Roman Clark said. The fire department said the sixth body, a 9-month-old boy found in his crib on the first floor, was found Thursday afternoon. The deceased children also include a 2-year-old boy; 3-year-old twin girls; and two girls, ages 10 and 11, Clark said. Firefighters encountered heavy flames coming from all three floors of the home when they answered the call about 12:30 a.m. Thursday, and they attacked the blaze from outside, Clark said. \u201cThe building was fully engulfed when they arrived on the scene,\u201d he said. The third floor collapsed and the second floor partially collapsed. The children\u2019s mother and two boys, ages 4 and 5, are in critical condition at a hospital and their 8-year-old sister may soon be released from the hospital. The 8-year-old girl helped rescue her younger brothers, Clark said. CBS Baltimore station WJZ-TV showed two small children sitting up as they were wheeled away on a stretcher and a woman on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over her face. Images from the scene show firefighters dousing the charred shell of the first two stories of the home between two other large three story single-family homes. William Malone said all nine are his children with Katie Malone, who\u2019s a staff member for Rep. Elijah Cummings\u2019 district office. William Malone told The Associated Press that he was not home at the time of the fire because he was at work for a restaurant. He said one of the three children taken to the hospital after the blaze has since been released. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock to be honest,\u201d said Malone, who was reached by phone at a relative\u2019s home. He said he doesn\u2019t know what may have caused the fire. Cummings said Katie Malone has worked as a special assistant in his Catonsville office for nearly 11 years. \u201cMy staff is a family and this unimaginable tragedy is shocking and heartbreaking to us all. I again ask for your prayers,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. A three-story house burns in northeast Baltimore early Jan. 12, 2017. WJZ-TV Neighbor Robert Spencer said he looked out his window to see the house across the street in flames. \u201cThe flames was coming out on every side, and that\u2019s when the mother was coming around the side of the house,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI heard the kids crying. My daughter heard them. They said: \u2018Help, help,\u2019 and you know, couldn\u2019t save them, couldn\u2019t save them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was just too much fire there.\u201d Michael Johnson, 55, who lives a block away and can see the house from his home, described it as a complete inferno. \u201cFire was coming out of every window, and as they sprayed it, it seemed like the fire was fighting back or something. It just kept coming and coming and coming. Fire was actually coming out of the sides of the house. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that in my life,\u201d Johnson said. Johnson, who didn\u2019t know the family, added that he was praying for the people inside. \u201cIt was just so intense,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would be able to survive it at all.\u201d The cause is under investigation. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Cubans leave the coast in a raft  in this August 1994 file photo in Havana Cuba during the 1994 massive exodus. (Photo: Jose Goitia, AP) President Obama announced Thursday an end to\u00a0the 20-year-old \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy that allowed\u00a0most Cuban migrants who reach U.S. soil to stay and become legal permanent residents after one year. President Obama\u00a0issued a statement Thursday evening saying\u00a0the U.S. is working to normalize relations with its one-time foe, and ending this\u00a0policy was the next logical step. \"Effective immediately, Cuban nationals who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal,\" Obama said. \"By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries.\" The \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy,\u00a0created by President Clinton in 1995,\u00a0has generally allowed\u00a0Cubans who simply touch U.S. soil\u00a0to stay in the country. Those caught at sea are returned to Cuba. In exchange for the new policy, Cuba has agreed to start accepting Cubans who were issued a deportation order in the United States, something the communist nation has refused to do for decades. The decision, formalized in a joint statement issued by both governments Thursday,\u00a0comes as Obama tries to cement his historic opening of diplomatic relations with Cuba and one week before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Obama ended more than five decades of isolation with Cuba in December 2014\u00a0and even visited the island in 2016. Trump has said he would renegotiate the U.S. dealings with Cuba, and ending the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy could affect Trump's plans. Cubans rush to U.S. shores before easy entry ends Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who has advocated for closer ties with Cuba, praised the move. \"Individuals on both sides of the U.S.-Cuba debate recognize and agree that ending \u2018wet foot, dry foot\u2019 is in our national interest,\" Flake said. \"It\u2019s a move that brings our Cuba policy into the modern era, while allowing the United States to continue its generous approach to those individuals and refugees with a legitimate claim for asylum.\" Others were enraged, arguing that Cuba's communist regime continues to violate the human rights\u00a0of its citizens. Frank Calzon, executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba, called Obama's decision \"another example of a heartless foreign policy.\" Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Cuban-American Republican from Florida, agreed.\u00a0\"With just eight days left in his administration, President Obama has found one more way to frustrate the democratic aspirations of the Cuban people and provide yet another shameful concession to the Castro regime,\" he said. Cubans have received favorable treatment from the United States\u00a0ever since Fidel Castro took control of the island in 1959 and declared it a communist ally of the Soviet Union. Congress passed the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1966 that allowed tens of thousands of Cubans who had already fled Castro's revolution to gain legal status in the U.S. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it left Cuba in economic ruin, prompting thousands more\u00a0to take to the sea for the United States\u00a0on makeshift boats and rafts. To end the crisis, Clinton enacted the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy. Rumors that the policy would end have been rampant in Cuba since the 2014 rapprochement between the two countries, prompting a surge of Cubans fleeing for the United States.\u00a0In the year before Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro announced the opening of diplomatic relations, 24,278 Cubans reached the U.S. That number nearly doubled in 2015 and surpassed 54,000 in 2016, according to the White House. Many Cubans continue\u00a0traveling to the U.S. by sea in rickety, dangerous boats built from spare parts in Cuba. In recent years, more Cubans have taken advantage of laws that allow them to travel to Ecuador, where thousands have started the long, dangerous land voyage across Venezuela, Central America and Mexico to reach the southwest border. Wave of Cubans finally reach U.S. after grueling land journey The Obama administration said the surge in Cubans risking their lives to reach the U.S. played an important factor in its decision. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes\u00a0said the improving diplomatic relationship between the two countries also contributed. For example, U.S. officials met Thursday with their Cuban counterparts in Washington to coordinate efforts to combat human trafficking, and another set of government officials met in Havana to discuss outstanding claims by U.S. citizens who had their property confiscated during Fidel Castro\u2019s revolution. Rhodes pointed to one more factor: Most Cubans now come to the U.S. \"for more traditional reasons, in terms of seeking economic opportunity,\" instead of fleeing in fear of the Castro regime as in the past. That's why the U.S. should treat them the same as economic migrants from any other country, Rhodes said. \"There's not going to be a separate queue for Cubans,\" he said. \"It just treats the Cuban migrants like migrants from other countries.\" Under the new joint agreement, the U.S. will still accept at least 20,000 Cubans each year through traditional immigration channels. 13923 CONNECT TWEET 26 LINKEDIN 237 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ipo6Vq NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Losing \u201cthe PR battle\u201d was one reason he couldn\u2019t get a hearing for his last Supreme Court nominee, he tells Steve Kroft in an interview to be broadcast Sunday on CBS.\u00a0 The full interview, Obama\u2019s last appearance on network television in a presidential interview, will be part of \u201c60 Minutes Presents: Barack Obama: Eight Years in the White House.\u201d The hour-long program will also follow the 44th president\u2019s journey through his own words in the 60 Minutes interviews he did with Kroft, beginning when Obama declared his candidacy in 2007, through the elections and the milestones of his eight years in the White House. \u201c60 Minutes Presents: Barack Obama: Eight Years in the White House\u201d will be broadcast Sunday, Jan. 15 at 7 p.m. ET/PT. \u00a0 President Barack Obama CBS News Below is a transcript of the excerpt that appeared on the CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley . Steve Kroft:You didn\u2019t change Washington. President Barack Obama: I changed those things that were in direct-- my direct control. I mean, I-- look, I\u2019m proud of the fact that, with two weeks to go, we\u2019re part of the first administration in modern history that hasn\u2019t had a major scandal in the White House. In that sense, we changed some things. I would\u2019ve liked to have gotten that one last Supreme Court justice in there. I\u2019d like the Supreme Court to take a look at-- Steve Kroft: You couldn\u2019t even get a hearing. President Barack Obama: But we couldn\u2019t even get a hearing. Trying to get the other side of the aisle to work with us on issues, in some cases, that they professed, originally, an interest in, and saying to them, \u201cHold on a second. You guys used to think this was a good idea. Now, just because I\u2019m supporting it, you can\u2019t change your mind.\u201d But they did. And what that did, I think, made me appreciate. And I\u2019ve said this before. But it\u2019s worth repeating. Because this is on me. Part of the job description is also shaping public opinion. And we were very effective, and I was very effective, in shaping public opinion around my campaigns. But there were big stretches, while governing, where even though we were doing the right thing, we weren\u2019t able to mobilize public opinion firmly enough behind us to weaken the resolve of the Republicans to stop opposing us or to cooperate with us.

The Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement Thursday that it issued a \"notice of violation\" to the company that covers about 104,000 vehicles including the 2014 through 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickups, all with 3-liter diesel engines. The California Air Resources Board took similar action. The EPA scheduled a news conference Thursday to explain details of the case. \"Failing to disclose software that affects emissions in a vehicle's engine is a serious violation of the law, which can result in harmful pollution in the air we breathe,\" said Cynthia Giles, EPA assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance. The agency said it will continue to investigate the \"nature and impact\" of the devices. The agency said FCA may be liable for civil penalties for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. The EPA is investigating whether the auxiliary emission control devices constitute \"defeat devices,\" which are illegal because they turn off pollution controls. Fiat Chrysler's shares fell more than 16 percent after the news was announced to $9.29. The announcement comes one day after Fiat rival Volkswagen pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal charges related to widespread cheating involving emissions tests with its \"Clean Diesel\" line of vehicles. Six high-ranking VW executives have been charged in the scandal. VW agreed to pay a record$4.3 billion penalty for cheating on emissions tests. 0 Shares ",

Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher during a game on Dec. 9, 2012. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) David Haugh Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Concerned about the safety of his son after the shooting death of the 11-year-old's stepfather in the family's Willow Springs home, Brian Urlacher filed an emergency motion in a Cook County courtroom this week and received temporary custody of the boy. After Judge Abbey Fishman Romanek granted the request Monday, Urlacher moved his son, Kennedy, to Arizona, where the former Bears linebacker lives with his wife and two daughters. \"This is an unfortunate situation, but my main concern is the best interests of my son,'' said Urlacher, who declined to provide details when contacted by phone Thursday. Urlacher, who has joint custody of Kennedy with the child's mother, Tyna Robertson, intervened after Robertson's husband Ryan Karageorge died Dec. 29 from a gunshot wound after a birthday party. In court documents, Urlacher cited \"suspicious circumstances'' he believes surround the incident, compelling him to want Kennedy immediately removed from Robertson's residence. Monday's evidentiary hearing at the Daley Center included testimony from Urlacher,\u00a0Robertson and Willow Springs detective Sharon Soltis. Karageorge, 34, a native of Hobart, Ind., died when a gun belonging to Robertson fired as he attempted to unload it, according to Urlacher's petition. The couple married in September. The investigation remains open and the Willow Springs Police Department has not responded to a Freedom of Information Act request for the police report the Tribune filed Wednesday. Reached Thursday on the phone by the Tribune, Robertson responded tersely, \"Leave me alone.\" Robertson's behavior in the hours following the shooting bothered Urlacher, according to the petition. Urlacher was with his son in Arizona just after 10 p.m. Dec. 29 when the boy received a Snapchat message from a cousin informing him that Karageorge had died. When Kennedy called his mother for confirmation she initially acted \"happy and cheerful,'' Urlacher alleged, before she eventually claimed Karageorge was involved in a fatal car accident. The next morning, Robertson called Urlacher to explain that, in fact, Karageorge had shot himself after the couple had an argument and Willow Springs police confiscated her cellphone as part of the investigation into the death. \"The environment with Tyna is a serious endangerment to the child's mental, moral or physical health, and if the child is required to return to Tyna's care, it will significantly impair his emotional development,'' Urlacher's attorney argued in the court filing. Kennedy's parents have a controversial past when it comes to the child's custody, including court battles and public spats. In 2007, the California Supreme Court ruled that Robertson's rape accusation against \"Lord of the Dance\" star Michael Flatley in 2002 wasn't credible and a settlement awarded Flatley $11 million. Urlacher, who also owns a home in Lake County, has enrolled Kennedy in school in Arizona. At the conclusion of Monday's hearing, Robertson left the courtroom \"and did not review the orders entered,'' according to Fishman Romanek's notations. A scheduled March 9 status hearing will present the results of the investigation by the court-appointed child representative. ",

Paper operating room schedules containing information on 836 people went missing from the Surgery Center at Presence St. Joseph Medical Center in Joliet on Oct. 22, 2013, according to information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Presence did not notify affected patients of the breach until Feb. 3, 2014. Health institutions are required under law to notify affected people within 60 days of a breach. The missing schedules contained patients' names, birth dates, dates and types of procedures, medical record numbers, surgeon names and types of anesthesia. A spokesman from Presence said in a statement that contact and financial information were not compromised. An HHS document saidthe lag in notification was caused by a miscommunication between employees. Presence is working with the department's Office for Civil Rights on a corrective action plan, which includes additional associate training on policies and procedures included in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. \"This is the culmination of a several year process working with the OCR to resolve a matter we voluntarily reported,\" Presence said in its statement.

(Photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images) You can all stop talking about Marie Osmond performing for Donald Trump at next week's inauguration because it's not happening. The Donny\u00a0& Marie star, Dancing With the Stars alumna and Nutrisystem pitchwoman issued a statement via Twitter Thursday asserting, \"Many of you have seen various stories saying that I volunteered or that I am performing at the inauguration. So let me be clear: I have no intention of performing at this inauguration, no matter who won!\" The stories started when Osmond did a video interview with Yahoo\u00a0Finance earlier this week, during which she was asked if she'd been invited, and if so, would she do it? \"I have not,\" she answered, adding, \"I don't get political ... But when it comes to our country, I think we need to unite. And to not support our president, I think, is wrong.\u00a0I think we should all support our president whether we\u2019re happy or sad.

I'm an entertainer. My interview statement simply tried to be nice and promote a message of love, not hate.\" She added that she has performed for previous presidents and takes kids from her Children's Miracle Network Hospitals\u00a0charity to the White House every year to meet the occupant, \"regardless of who the sitting president is.\" ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo Breaking down the stage after President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s news conference on Wednesday. As new would-be scandals rapidly follow older ones, many fail to gain traction. Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times The bar for scandal in the Trump administration keeps being raised. Every week brings potentially damaging developments that in other contexts could have generated weekslong controversies. With so many competing stories, however, they are frequently ignored or forgotten. As a result, even negative coverage can sometimes benefit President-elect Donald J. Trump by displacing potentially more damaging stories from the news agenda. For instance, many of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees for cabinet positions have faced relatively little scrutiny of their backgrounds or records. Many failed even to complete background checks before the start of Senate hearings, a break from decades of precedent . Or consider the case of Monica Crowley, an incoming National Security Agency aide found to have engaged in extensive plagiarism in her book (which Harper Collins pulled from the market), her Ph.D. dissertation and her Washington Times column . These developments have struggled to gain traction amid the many competing stories about Mr. Trump and his presidential transition, including Tuesday night\u2019s release of unverified allegations against the president-elect. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Scandals need time and space to develop. When the news cycle is congested, potential scandals are deprived of attention, causing the media to move on to other stories and the political opposition to anticipate that any criticisms will probably have little effect. Many observers suspect that Mr. Trump seeks to exploit this dynamic by distracting the press and the public with stunts like meeting with Kanye West after delaying a news conference on conflicts of interest or tweeting about Meryl Streep before hearings to consider his nominees on Capitol Hill. It\u2019s impossible to determine his motivations, of course, but the effect is often to divert attention from less flattering issues. On Wednesday, for instance, Mr. Trump\u2019s long-delayed news conference on conflict of interest issues was scheduled on the same day as hearings for six nominees. (After Democrats accused Republicans of scheduling the hearings in part to exploit this dynamic and divert the news media\u2019s attention, some were rescheduled.) History shows that potential scandals can easily be crowded off the news agenda by other events. During the chaotic post-9/11 period, for instance, the focus on more important events kept Army Secretary Thomas White in office despite numerous questionable decisions . (The post-9/11 surge in news continued all the way through the invasion of Iraq in early 2003, helping to insulate George W. Bush from fallout over the collapse of the Enron corporation and other matters; Bush didn\u2019t suffer a major scandal until Valerie Plame was outed as a C.I.A. officer that summer.) Another example came during the summer of 2009, when the death of Michael Jackson helped push the furor over the affair of the South Carolina governor, Mark Sanford, out of the news. By contrast, relatively slow news periods may increase the likelihood of a scandal\u2019s developing, as with the travel habits of former White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu in 1991, which became an issue in the months after the end of the first Persian Gulf war, and as with Chris Christie\u2019s Bridgegate scandal in 2014. In an article published in The British Journal of Political Science, I provide quantitative evidence suggesting that competition from other news stories can prevent potential scandals from reaching critical mass. Using data from more than three decades of news media coverage of the president and the executive branch, I show that when the incidence of major disasters and tragedies causes an unexpected surge in news coverage, the likelihood of a new scandal developing and the intensity of scandal coverage both decrease significantly. (I find that a similar dynamic appears to apply to governors .) In this sense, the continuing reality show that Mr. Trump creates may help protect him from deep damage by any particular scandal. As in the campaign, he makes so much news every day that few stories ever generate sustained controversy. Instead, public attention lurches from one story to the next, never quite focusing on any particular controversy. He may prefer it that way.

(J. Scott Applewhite / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The Justice Department's inspector general announced Thursday he will launch an investigation into the department and FBI 's actions in the months leading up to the 2016 election, including whether department policies were properly followed by FBI Director James Comey . Democrats have blamed Comey's handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server and his late-October release of a letter about the case as among the reasons for her loss to Republican Donald Trump . Inspector General Michael Horowitz said the investigation would look at whether department or FBI policies were followed in relation to Comey's actions in the case. The review will examine Comey's news conference in July 2016 in which he said that the FBI would not recommend charges. During his announcement, Comey delivered an unusual public statement for an FBI chief by chastising Clinton and her aides as \"extremely careless.\" It will also review the two letters he sent to Congress about the case in the final days before the 2016 election. Clinton and her aides said the disclosure of \"new\" emails \u2014 found on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner , the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin \u2014 less than two weeks before Election Day hurt her in several battleground states.

Earlier this week, current and former intelligence officials were speaking in hopeful tones about how the breach that had developed between their profession and the president-elect was repairable. \"Certainly fixable,\" is how Michael Morell, a Trump critic and former acting director of the CIA, put it on Tuesday afternoon, after several days without a single Trump tweet disparaging intelligence officers. \"He may be getting a sense that these are serious people who have studied their mistakes and who are careful about what they say,\" said John McLaughlin, another former acting CIA director.

The president-elect, in his first news conference in months, accused \"the intelligence agencies\" of \"disgraceful\" leaking, and compared the behavior to something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.\" This is happening just as Trump's nominee to be CIA director, Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday morning, answering questions in a confirmation hearing. Pompeo will have to walk a careful line between loyalty to his boss and expressions of respect for the workforce he would lead.

We've got to have that because otherwise we're going to have complete dysfunctionality in our national security.\" What about the career officers, who aren't leaving, and who have been in the receiving end of a steady stream of negative Trump tweets? Trump \"CAN fix (the breach). But today he took a huge step back from fixing it,\" Morell wrote in an email on Wednesday. Trump and the intelligence community do seem to agree on their criticism of the way the media has reported on these issues, and that leaks are bad. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper extended an olive branch to Trump Wednesday night. He said he spoke to Trump and \"expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security.\" Clapper said he emphasized that the 35-page memo is not an intelligence community document \"and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC. The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions.\" Clapper said the president-elect \"again affirmed his appreciation for all the men and women serving in the Intelligence Community, and I assured him that the IC stands ready to serve his Administration and the American people.\" 'I think it was Russia' From the perspective of career intelligence officers, at least one good thing did happen during Wednesday's press conference: Trump, for the first time, appeared to accept the unanimous finding of the intelligence community that Russia was behind the hacking and leaking campaign designed to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.\" \"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\" Trump said. But he also accused the intelligence community of targeting him with leaks. \"I have many meetings with intelligence,\" Trump said. \"And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody's leaking it out\u2026It's very unfair to the country.\" Trump added that it was \"disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out.\" It's not public who disclosed to news organizations that a summary of damaging personal information about Trump was included in the Russia hacking briefing materials. But the briefing papers circulated beyond the intelligence agencies, to Congress and the White House. In any event, current and former intelligence officers say that despite the bad start, intelligence professionals will do what they can to regain Trump's trust. \"There's an overwhelming desire to actually serve any president as best you can,\" McLaughlin said. \"Yes, they will want access to and influence in the White House, but the only way you get it is to know your stuff. To actually have some expertise on the issues that they are trying to decide.\" McLaughlin, Morell and other former officials said intelligence insiders were deeply disturbed by Trump's approach to the findings on Russian hacking. For weeks, he cast doubt on them, and on the intelligence officers who reached them. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow last week that Trump was \"being really dumb\" by doing that. \"Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,\" Schumer said. Trump may have since learned, McLaughlin said, that \"this community is not as easily cowed by snarky tweets and verbal barbs as some of his other targets. They are used to that. It goes with the territory.\" Ken Dilanian ",

Mark Warner, the committee's ranking Democrat, was making his opening remarks, the power went out, prompting everyone to relocate to a different room. Republican Sen. Richard Burr, the committee's chairman, assured NBC News' Kelly O'Donnell the outage was the result of a central power failure affecting parts of the Senate office building, and not some nefarious cause. Fellow Kansas Republicans, former Sen. Bob Dole and current Sen. Pat Roberts, introduced Pompeo to the committee. Zeroing in on Russia In his opening remarks, Pompeo took aim at Russia, saying that Moscow has \"reasserted itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe and doing nothing to aid in the defeat of ISIS.\" He later said, \"It's pretty clear about what took place here about Russia involvement in efforts to hack information and to have an impact on American democracy.\" The remarks put him at odds with the president-elect, who has repeatedly challenged the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was behind a hack on the Democratic National Committee. Trump at a Wednesday press conference said \"As far as hacking, I think it's Russia,\" but quickly pivoted to mentioning other nations that engage in cyberattacks. Russia has denied being involved.

His comments were delivered in a speech to the Marines' Memorial Club in San Francisco after he retired from the military. \"I'm coming in with the understanding that I lead the Department of Defense, and if someone brings me a problem, then I'll look at it,\" Mattis said today. \"But I'm not coming in looking for problems. I'm looking for ways to get the department so it's at the most lethal stance. \"I have no plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military,\" Mattis concluded. President-elect Donald Trump has called President Barack Obama's decision to open combat roles to women \"politically correct\" and has linked it to the military's problems with sexual assault, but he has not said he would reverse the decisions. Gillibrand also briefly questioned Mattis about his beliefs regarding members of the LGBT community serving in the military. \u201cFrankly, Senator, I\u2019ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with,\u201d Mattis said.

The change in the policy would effectively mean Cubans are treated like other immigrants in that those who enter the United States illegally would be subject to return, according to the White House. Other countries in the region have been asking the U.S. to end the special status because of what they say is the burden that Cuban immigrants trying to make it into America has placed on them. Cubans have been offered a \"special visa\" status that allows them, with a single \"dry\" foot on U.S. soil to claim a green card and get onto a pathway to citizenship , a policy developed in the mid-1990s by President Bill Clinton . The Clinton measure was designed to slow the tide of Cuban migrants coming to the U.S. by sea. Before that even migrants rescued at sea would be brought to the United States. The \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy was continued under Presidents Bush and Obama. \"Effective immediately, Cuban nationals who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal, consistent with U.S. law and enforcement priorities,\" the White House statement said. \"By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries.\" The Cuban government hailed the announcement. According to The Associated Press, Cuba's top diplomat for U.S. affairs, Josefina Vidal, said of the policy, \"It was creating serious problems for the security of Cuba, for the security of the United States and for the security of our citizens left vulnerable to human trafficking, migratory fraud and violence as a result of the incentives created by these preferential policies.\" According to the White House, the Cuban government has agreed to accept the return of those entering the U.S. illegally as well as those who are stopped at sea. The administration has for months said it can't end the special immigration status for Cubans coming to the U.S., claiming that decision rested with Congress. According to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, the decision to end the program with only a week left in the Obama administration came after negotiations with Cuba . \"Since I took office, we have put the Cuban-American community at the center of our policies,\" the White House said. \"With this change we will continue to welcome Cubans as we welcome immigrants from other nations, consistent with our laws.\" 0 Shares ",

Those are among the conclusions about marijuana reached by a federal advisory panel in a report released Thursday. A landmark report released Thursday found solid evidence that marijuana is effective in relieving multiple ailments, but it also has potentially ... The experts also called for a national effort to learn more about marijuana and its chemical cousins, including similarly acting compounds called cannabinoids. The current lack of scientific information \u201cposes a public health risk,\u201d said the report, released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Patients, health care professionals and policy makers need more evidence to make sound decisions, it said. It was hard for the researchers to make definitive conclusions, said CBS News\u2019 Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, because a lot of the literature is based off of self-reporting -- and there was no standardization. For example, there are over 100 different cannabinoid chemcials in cannabis, and many different forms of using it.\u00a0 Several factors have limited research. While the federal government has approved some medicines containing ingredients found in marijuana, it still classifies marijuana as illegal and imposes restrictions on research. So scientists have to jump through bureaucratic hoops that some find daunting, the report said. CBSN Originals explores the rapidly changing landscape of legal marijuana, traveling to five states and Canada to interview key figures on all si... A federal focus on paying for studies of potential harms has also impeded research into possible health benefits, the report said. The range of marijuana products available for study has also been restricted, although the government is expanding the number of approved suppliers. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for a variety of medical uses, and eight of those states plus the district have also legalized it for recreational use. The report lists nearly 100 conclusions about marijuana and its similarly acting chemical cousins, drawing on studies published since 1999. It found strong evidence, for example, that marijuana can treat chronic pain in adults and that similar compounds ease nausea from chemotherapy, with varying degrees of evidence for treating muscle stiffness and spasms in multiple sclerosis. Limited evidence says marijuana or the other compounds can boost appetite in people with HIV or AIDS, and ease symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, the report concluded. But it said there\u2019s not enough research to say whether they\u2019re effective for treating cancers, irritable bowel syndrome, epilepsy, or certain symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, or helping people beat addictions. There may be more evidence soon: a study in Colorado is investigating the use of marijuana to treat PTSD . Turning to potential harms, the committee concluded: - Strong evidence links marijuana use to the risk of developing schizophrenia and other causes of psychosis, with the highest risk among the most frequent users. - Some evidence suggests a small increased risk for developing depressive disorders, but there\u2019s no evidence either way on whether it affects the course or symptoms of such disorders, or the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder. - There\u2019s strong evidence that using marijuana increases the risk of a traffic accident, but no clear indication that it promotes workplace accidents or injuries, or death from a marijuana overdose. - There\u2019s only weak evidence for the idea that it hurts school achievement, raises unemployment rates or harms social functioning. - For pregnant women who smoke pot , there\u2019s strong evidence of reduced birthweight but only weak evidence of any effect on pregnancy complications for the mother, or an infant\u2019s need for admission to intensive care. There\u2019s not enough evidence to show whether it affects the child later, like sudden infant death syndrome or substance use. - Some evidence suggests there\u2019s no link to lung cancer in marijuana smokers. But there\u2019s no evidence, or insufficient evidence, to support or rebut any link to developing cancers of the prostate, cervix, bladder, or esophagus. - Substantial evidence links pot smoking to worse respiratory symptoms and more frequent episodes of chronic bronchitis. - There\u2019s weak evidence that suggests smoking marijuana can trigger a heart attack, especially for people at high risk of heart disease. But there\u2019s no evidence either way on whether chronic use affects a person\u2019s risk of a heart attack. - Some evidence suggests a link between using marijuana and developing a dependence on or abuse of other substances, including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

KTOP-TV Email OAKLAND, Calif. -- Gunfire outside Oakland\u2019s City Hall while the City Council was in session on Tuesday elicited a joke caught on video that didn\u2019t sit well with some of the gathered politicians, CBS San Francisco station KPIX-TV reports . While the shooting was alarming enough, the casual joke made by a councilmember right after has made things worse. In the video, Councilmember Annie Campbell Washington is seen standing after hearing the gunshots during a meeting. \u201cIs that gunfire?\u201d Campbell Washington asks. As she heads to the window, Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan takes the microphone. \u201cThis is a Rorschach test: Who, when they hear gunfire, runs toward the window and who goes from the window?\u201d asked Kaplan. \u201cIf you go toward the window, you probably live in an upscale neighborhood.\u201d As the other councilmembers in the room laugh, Campbell Washington is seen heading out the door. The meeting continues as usual for a vote until the shooting is confirmed. \u201cI am absolutely still shaken from the incident,\u201d Campbell Washington said when asked about the shooting. Campbell Washington told KPIX-TV she ran out of the room to check on her 12-year-old daughter, who was outside City Hall. At a nearby intersection, police said one man was shot before being taken to a hospital. \u201cIt was a very close call with my child,\u201d said Campbell Washington. \u201cI\u2019m very shaken from that, and I know that every mother in the city feels the exact same way.\u201d The joke Kaplan told inside City Hall fell flat with other councilmembers. \u201cI think that\u2019s just an inappropriate comment to make,\u201d Councilmember Larry Reid said. When KPIX-TV asked Kaplan about it, she replied, \u201cThe commentary that some neighborhoods struggle more with gun violence than other neighborhoods is a true fact.\u201d When asked if she could defend laughing after the shooting, Kaplan said the joke was about what happened in the council chamber. \u201cI was not laughing at the shooting,\u201d said Kaplan. \u201cMy point is because the camera didn\u2019t show the room, people didn\u2019t know what I was referring to because there was a large crowd in the room and some of whom ran toward the window and some of whom ran from the window.\u201d Reid said the gunshots were no laughing matter in a city plagued by violence. \u201cThis is downtown Oakland,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the heart of the city. It\u2019s less than 100, maybe 200 feet from City Hall. And stuff like that is just insane.\u201d When asked if she would go back and change things after her fellow councilmember called her reaction inappropriate, Kaplan clarified her response. \u201cWell, I think it is essential that we make clear that we are taking action against gun violence, and that is the response that people need to understand,\u201d said Kaplan. Reid said he\u2019s been working inside City Hall for 20 years, and this is not the first time he\u2019s heard gunshots outside. The councilmembers agreed that gun violence remains a major problem in Oakland, where there were 88 homicides last year. They also said they are hopeful and confident that the city\u2019s new police chief will help turn things around. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

The president made a historic visit to the island nation last year\u2014 the first American president to do so since Calvin Coolidge made the trek nearly 90 years ago. The wet foot, dry-foot policy was added in a 1995 revision of the Cuban Adjustment Act, the 1966 legislation intended to isolate Cuba, which Obama has worked to eliminate. Cubans who were apprehended in the waters between the two countries, however, were returned to Cuba under the policy. The policy was designed to prevent mass migrations of Cubans to the U.S., while still recognizing the political ramifications of turning back Cubans, particularly from the Cuban American community where the opposition to the Castro regime has been fervent. Josefina Vidal, the Cuban foreign ministry's director general of the department of the U.S., said Thursday's announcement solves a major problem regarding the normalization of migration relations, but called on Congress to eliminate the Cuban Adjustment Act. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and White House Advisor Ben Rhodes also said Congress should repeal the law. Advocates for ending the policy hailed the administration's move. \"This is a logical, responsible, and important step towards further normalizing relations with Cuba,\" James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a non-profit group working to end the travel and trade embargo on Cuba said in a statement. \"The 'wet foot, dry foot' policy has been an enduring problem that decades of hostility and isolation failed to solve. This change, which has long had strong bipartisan support, would not have been possible without the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.\" Play ",

    "text": "PBS NewsHour YouTube President Obama awarded outgoing Vice President Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Thursday afternoon. Calling the former longtime Delaware senator \"the best vice president America's ever had\" and a \"lion of American history,\" Obama gave his White House partner the surprise award in an emotional ceremony, initially billed as a farewell. #MemeoftheWeek: The Best Of The Obama-Biden 'BROTUS' After extolling the job that Biden has done, Obama ended it with the unexpected news that he was giving the vice president the nation's highest civilian honor, with distinction \u2014 a designation previously given only to President Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II and Gen. Colin Powell. \"To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without self-regard, and to live life fully,\" Obama said. Overcome with tears and completely caught off guard by the award, Biden praised the president as \"remarkable man who did remarkable things for this country\" who had truly treated him like an equal partner in governance. \"This honor is not only well beyond what I deserve, but it's a reflection of the generosity of your spirit,\" Biden told Obama. \"I don't deserve this. But I know it came from the president's heart.\" President Obama presents a teary-eyed Vice President Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House on Thursday. Susan Walsh/AP hide caption toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP President Obama presents a teary-eyed Vice President Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House on Thursday. Susan Walsh/AP The two have enjoyed an unusually close working relationship over the past eight years, and Obama himself even joked at the outset of the ceremony that \"this also gives the Internet one last chance to talk about our 'bromance.' \" Throughout the ceremony it was evident not just how close the two men were but how close their families and staffs had become, and Obama said his \"family is honored to call ourselves honorary Bidens.\" Article continues after sponsorship Transcript And Analysis: Obama Addresses The Nation In Farewell Speech Obama has frequently said that picking Biden, his former primary rival, as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made. Before accepting the nomination, Biden had spent more than three decades in the Senate, amassing a large portfolio and body of work, including stints as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The president said, laughing, that the people of Delaware sent Biden to the Senate as soon as they could, electing him to the Senate at the age of 29 (he turned the constitutionally required age of 30 before he was sworn in). Vice President Biden: 'Trump Is Out There Doing Something Very Dangerous' But before Biden could even head to Washington, his life would be marked with unspeakable tragedy for the first time. While Christmas shopping, his first wife and 1-year-old daughter were killed in a car wreck; his sons Hunter and Beau were injured in the accident. Biden considered resigning before he even took office but was persuaded not to. He was sworn into office at the hospital beside his sons, and for years he would famously commute back and forth every day on Amtrak to be with his family. Later on, he would meet and marry his now-wife, Jill, and they would have a daughter together, Ashley. Joe Biden: Window 'Has Closed' For A White House Bid In 2015, tragedy would strike the Biden family again when his eldest son, Beau, the former Delaware attorney general who was long seen as his father's political heir, died at the age of 46 from brain cancer. The loss came as the elder Biden was weighing whether he should make his own run at the Oval Office to succeed Obama. Months later, the still very emotional vice president acknowledged his window had passed and said that he wouldn't launch his own presidential campaign. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Parts of the story remain out of reach \u2014 most critically the basic question of how much, if anything, in the dossier is true. But it is possible to piece together a rough narrative of what led to the current crisis, including lingering questions about the ties binding Mr. Trump and his team to Russia. The episode also offers a glimpse of the hidden side of presidential campaigns, involving private sleuths-for-hire looking for the worst they can find about the next American leader. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The story began in September 2015, when a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists, Fusion GPS, to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate\u2019s past scandals and weaknesses, according to a person familiar with the effort. The person described the opposition research work on condition of anonymity, citing the volatile nature of the story and the likelihood of future legal disputes. The identity of the donor is unclear. Fusion GPS, headed by a former Wall Street Journal journalist known for his dogged reporting, Glenn Simpson, most often works for business clients. But in presidential elections, the firm is sometimes hired by candidates, party organizations or donors to do political \u201coppo\u201d work \u2014 shorthand for opposition research \u2014 on the side. It is routine work and ordinarily involves creating a big, searchable database of public information: past news reports, documents from lawsuits and other relevant data. For months, Fusion GPS gathered the documents and put together the files from Mr. Trump\u2019s past in business and entertainment, a rich target. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More After Mr. Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee in the spring, the Republican interest in financing the effort ended. But Democratic supporters of Hillary Clinton were very interested, and Fusion GPS kept doing the same deep dives, but on behalf of new clients. In June, the tenor of the effort suddenly changed. The Washington Post reported that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked, apparently by Russian government agents, and a mysterious figure calling himself \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d began to publish the stolen documents online. Mr. Simpson hired Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer with whom he had worked before. Mr. Steele, in his early 50s, had served undercover in Moscow in the early 1990s and later was the top expert on Russia at the London headquarters of Britain\u2019s spy service, MI6. When he stepped down in 2009, he started his own commercial intelligence firm, Orbis Business Intelligence. The former journalist and the former spy, according to people who know them, had similarly dark views of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former K.G.B. officer, and the varied tactics he and his intelligence operatives used to smear, blackmail or bribe their targets. As a former spy who had carried out espionage inside Russia, Mr. Steele was in no position to travel to Moscow to study Mr. Trump\u2019s connections there. Instead, he hired native Russian speakers to call informants inside Russia and made surreptitious contact with his own connections in the country as well. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Steele wrote up his findings in a series of memos, each a few pages long, that he began to deliver to Fusion GPS in June and continued at least until December. By then, the election was over, and neither Mr. Steele nor Mr. Simpson was being paid by a client, but they did not stop what they believed to be very important work. (Mr. Simpson declined to comment for this article, and Mr. Steele did not immediately reply to a request for comment.) The memos described two different Russian operations. The first was a yearslong effort to find a way to influence Mr. Trump, perhaps because he had contacts with Russian oligarchs whom Mr. Putin wanted to keep track of. According to Mr. Steele\u2019s memos, it used an array of familiar tactics: the gathering of \u201ckompromat,\u201d compromising material such as alleged tapes of Mr. Trump with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel, and proposals for business deals attractive to Mr. Trump. The goal would probably never have been to make Mr. Trump a knowing agent of Russia, but to make him a source who might provide information to friendly Russian contacts. But if Mr. Putin and his agents wanted to entangle Mr. Trump using business deals, they did not do it very successfully. Mr. Trump has said he has no major properties there, though one of his sons said at a real estate conference in 2008 that \u201ca lot of money\u201d was \u201cpouring in from Russia.\u201d The second Russian operation described was recent: a series of contacts with Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives during the campaign, in part to discuss the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. According to Mr. Steele\u2019s sources, it involved, among other things, a late-summer meeting in Prague between Michael Cohen, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, and Oleg Solodukhin, a Russian official who works for Rossotrudnichestvo, an organization that promotes Russia\u2019s interests abroad.

Trump\u2019s nominee for defense secretary, arrived for his confirmation hearing in Washington on Thursday. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times On the third day of confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill, there was one emerging theme: Many of the nominees of President-elect Donald J. Trump have disagreements with him on policy. There were serious questions, efforts at diversion with humor, and long-winded statements by senators. Overall, though, none of the nominees made any major mistakes, and one of them, James N. Mattis , a retired Marine Corps general, was approved as Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary by the Senate Armed Services Committee, 24 to 3. Fun fact: He doesn\u2019t care for the nickname \u201cMad Dog.\u201d Here are 10 highlights from the hearings: \u25a0 Mr. Mattis diverged sharply from his prospective boss on Russia, calling Moscow one of the top threats to the American-led world order. \u201cI\u2019m all for engagement,\u201d Mr. Mattis said, \u201cbut we also have to recognize reality in terms of what Russia is up to.\u201d \u25a0 Mr. Mattis also put daylight between himself and Mr. Trump on NATO and indicated strong support for the alliance\u2019s principle of collective defense. \u201cMy view is that nations with allies thrive, and nations without allies don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u25a0 Mr. Mattis said he supported the Iran nuclear agreement, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized. \u25a0 And finally, he said that he had no intention of revisiting the Obama administration\u2019s decisions on social issues at the Defense Department, like the opening of combat roles to women.

Mr. Pompeo had previously said he did not believe waterboarding was torture, and that it was legal. Photo Representative Mike Pompeo was sworn in at the start of his confirmation hearing to be C.I.A. director on Thursday. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times \u25a0 Mr. Pompeo signaled that he agreed with the assessment of United States intelligence agencies that Russian President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, describing the report that was delivered last week to Mr. Trump and President Obama as \u201csound.\u201d \u25a0 Ben Carson \u2019s confirmation hearing for secretary of housing and urban development was not attended by Mr. Trump. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, directed biting comments at the president-elect. Ms. Warren, while accusing Mr. Trump of hiding his assets, repeatedly asked Mr. Carson if he would commit to keeping taxpayers\u2019 dollars away from Trump businesses. \u25a0 Mr. Carson successfully parried questions about whether someone who had gained acclaim as neurosurgeon was qualified to oversee the vast federal housing agency. Though he has no background in housing, he avoided any major stumbles. \u25a0 Democrats seemed to take it a bit easy on Mr. Carson, with some talking about his young granddaughter attending and others questioning him without being too adversarial.

    "text": "Philippines to Offer Free Contraceptives to 6 Million Women \u201cThis is pretty much consistent with how Abe has approached Duterte since he took office,\u201d said Gregory Poling , the director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cHe\u2019s been, in a sense, the good cop to the Australia-E.U.-U.S. bad cop.\u201d Duterte has been a frequent critic of the United States, threatening to scale back joint military exercises and going so far to suggest he would kick U.S. troops stationed in the Philippines out of the country. He welcomed two Russian warships last week to the Philippine capital, Manila, calling the Russians \"friends\" and saying he hoped they would \"come back more often.\u201d Duterte, meanwhile, has received widespread international criticism for his harsh campaign against illegal drugs, including from President Obama\u2019s administration. Abe\u2019s visit, during which he promised billions in investment and aid to the Philippines, comes just three months after Duterte visited Japan. Then, Abe emphasized the strength and importance of the U.S. role in the region, according to Sheila Smith , a senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cI think Abe is trying delicately to not temper Duterte, but to sort of put a broader context on the U.S. presence in the region,\u201d Smith said. As such, he may be trying to play a stabilizing role as a handover of power takes place in the United States, she said. More significantly, Abe wants to strengthen regional cooperation to counter what it views as threatening Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, analysts said. Overtures between Russia and the Philippines are largely optics, they said. \u201cIt\u2019s really China that can make or break the Philippines economy,\u201d said James Schoff , a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\u2019s Asia Program and a former senior adviser for East Asia policy at the U.S. Department of Defense. \u201cThey want to salvage all the agreements that the United States made with the Philippines before Duterte came into power,\u201d he added. \u201cAbe wants to keep those alive. So, he\u2019ll reinforce the value of the U.S.-Philippines relationship during those discussions.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

The probe by Michael E. Horowitz will include a review of FBI Director James Comey's news conference in July and his two letters to lawmakers in late October and early November. \"In response to requests from numerous Chairmen and Ranking Members of Congressional oversight committees, various organizations, and members of the public, the Office of the Inspector General will initiate a review of allegations regarding certain actions by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in advance of the 2016 election,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. FBI Director James Comey (file photo) JOSHUA ROBERTS / Reuters Just 11 days before the 2016 general election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI was reviewing a new batch of emails that appeared to be pertinent to their investigation. The emails, discovered during a probe, were found on a laptop that former New York congressman Anthony Weiner allegedly used to send lewd text messages and pictures to an underage girl. Investigators also discovered Weiner's estranged wife, Huma Abedin, had used the same laptop to send emails to Clinton. Ultimately, those emails were deemed unrelated to the Clinton email probe. But Clinton and her surrogates felt the timing of Comey's announcement hurt her presidential bid . Most recently Bill Clinton was more blunt while talking to shoppers in a local New York bookstore reportedly saying Comey \"cost\" her the election. President-elect Donald Trump lauded Comey's actions at the time and said they \"took guts.\" According to a Justice Department statement, Horowitz will also examine: Allegations that the FBI Deputy Director should have been recused from participating in certain investigative matters; Allegations that the Department's Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs improperly disclosed non-public information to the Clinton campaign and/or should have been recused from participating in certain matters; Allegations that Department and FBI employees improperly disclosed non-public information; and Allegations that decisions regarding the timing of the FBI's release of certain Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) documents on October 30 and November 1, 2016, and the use of a Twitter account to publicize same, were influenced by improper considerations. Comey said he is \"grateful\" for the review. \"I am grateful to the Department of Justice's IG for taking on this review,\" Comey said in a statement. \"He is professional and independent and the FBI will cooperate fully with him and his office. I hope very much he is able to share his conclusions and observations with the public because everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency regarding this matter.\" The response to the review in political circles on Thursday afternoon was swift.

AP Photo/Evan Vucci Email Following organized calls for a boycott of outdoor gear and apparel company L.L. Bean, President-elect Donald Trump gave his Twitter endorsement to the brand Thursday, directing his followers to \u201cBuy L.L.Bean.\u201d His tweet personally thanked heiress Linda Bean, linking to the Twitter account of her Perfect Maine restaurant chain: \u00a0 Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage.

Bean came after the Federal Election Commission had charged that the heiress contributed $55,000 more than the legal donation amount to a political action committee supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Bean, according to reports by the Associated Press, gave $60,000 to the Make America Great Again LLC, which spent a total of $66,862 on pro-Trump materials, and online and broadcast advertising. The FEC letter warned that the organization not could face punishment for the donation. The group -- which is not registered as a super PAC, a type of committee that has fewer limits on raising funds -- is only legally able accept individual contributions that do not exceed $5,000. Bean, who is a part-owner of the company, has pushed back on the FEC letter, according to a statement in Maine\u2019s Press Herald newspaper. ",

But maintaining continuous coverage can be tricky.\u00a0 \u201cYou may be in the hospital and lose track of a bill,\u201d said Cheryl Fish-Parcham, private insurance program director at the patient advocacy organization Families USA. \u201cOr you may be suddenly unemployed, lose coverage and not be able to afford individual coverage,\u201d she added. For sick patients who cannot continue coverage, Ryan\u2019s plan calls for a return to state-run high-risk pools. These pools allow sick people to buy insurance separately, while states, insurers and the federal government help subsidize the cost. The president-elect\u2019s website says he supports risk pools. Risk pools have a long and controversial past. Before the ACA was passed, 35 states ran risk pools for people with preexisting conditions ranging from cancer and diabetes to more minor afflictions such as arthritis or eczema. Premiums for risk pool coverage were as much as 250 percent more than a healthy person would pay for individual insurance, and some states, overwhelmed with sick patients, had wait lists for coverage or imposed other restrictions, said Fish-Parcham.\u00a0 \u201cGoing back to risk pools is going back to the bad old days,\u201d she said.

CBS affiliate KOTV Email OKLAHOMA CITY --\u00a0A winter storm that brought heavy snow and rainfall to northern California was bearing down on the southern Plains on Thursday, and forecasters said crippling ice accumulations and heavy rain could cause widespread power outages and flooding this weekend.\u00a0 \u201cConditions are steadily improving in\u00a0 California and Nevada . Flooding is still occurring on many rivers, but precipitation is much lighter than in past days,\u201d\u00a0 the National Weather Service said . \u201cMeanwhile, conditions are coming together for a freezing rain event from the southern Plains to Mid-Atlantic starting Thursday night and lasting through Saturday.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The National Weather Service issued a winter storm watch beginning Friday morning for much of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, along with parts of Illinois and Texas. Forecasters said the potential for a significant ice storm is increasing and the region could see up to 1 inch of ice. Storms are also expected Saturday and Sunday.\u00a0 Rain-soaked communities across the West face a sixth day of intense downpours. The new storms follow the heaviest rain in a decade. Flooding trig... \u201cWe could see some fairly significant ice accumulations,\u201d said Kevin Brown, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma. \u201cEnough ice accumulations to cause a lot of problems with trees and power lines and power interruptions.\u201d In northeastern Oklahoma, where the forecast calls for up to an inch of accumulated ice, residents Thursday were snatching up flashlights, batteries and alternative energy sources in anticipation of power disruptions. \u201cThey\u2019re grabbing generators, and I\u2019m sold out,\u201d said Raymond Bopp, assistant manager of the Woodward Ace Hardware store in Woodward, Oklahoma, about 140 miles northwest of Oklahoma City. The last time the area experienced a significant ice storm was in 2001, when electrical power was interrupted for three or four days, Bopp said. Residents who recall the inconvenience were taking no chances. \u201cThey\u2019ve been buying a lot of flashlights,\u201d Bopp said. Propane containers, kerosene and lamp oil also were selling well as the storm neared. The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management was assembling generators and supplies for temporary shelters across northwestern and northern Oklahoma, said spokeswoman Keli Cain. \u201cIf there\u2019s a need for additional generators, we want them to be available,\u201d Cain said.\u00a0 Electricity crews were also doing maintenance work to prepare, CBS Tulsa affiliate KOTV reported . In Kansas, up to 1 inch of ice was expected to fall in \u201cmultiple rounds\u201d of freezing rain between Friday and early Monday in parts of the state, including Wichita, Kansas\u2019 largest city. The weather service said the potential impact will be power outages, slick roads and accidents.\u00a0 In Missouri, forecasters were calling for up to three-quarters of an inch of freezing rain over the weekend, potentially more in the southwestern part of the state. Concern about the storm prompted Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens to activate the state Emergency Operations Center. \u201cEveryone should be aware that this potential weather event could disrupt travel and cause power outages across the state,\u201d Greitens said in a statement. In California, the storm brought heavy snowfall in higher elevations and led thousands of people to evacuate as rivers surged. Brown said the Pacific Ocean moisture that helped feed the storm has shifted south, creating the potential for ice and heavy rainfall in southern Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re still going to have plenty of moisture to deal with. We could see some pretty strong storms as well,\u201d Brown said. He said severe storms are possible south of the Red River. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "How Donald Trump May Violate the Constitution the Second He's Sworn In By Jordyn Phelps Jan 12, 2017, 5:04 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Emoluments Clause: The Basics 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump may be handing over the reins of his global real estate empire to his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and to a longtime business executive, but he still risks violating the U.S. Constitution, some experts have warned. Sheri Dillon, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, the law firm she said Donald Trump Sr. directed \u201cto design a structure for his business empire,\u201d told reporters Wednesday that the financial trust Trump signed would \u201ccompletely isolate [Trump] from the management of the company.\u201d \u201cThe Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here, but just like with conflicts of interest, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury. This way it is the American people who will profit.\u201d Legal experts, however, tell ABC News that the plan fails to comply with the Constitution by not adequately separating the future president from his myriad business interests. Constitutional law expert and Harvard professor Laurence Tribe argues that Trump will be \u201ca walking, tweeting violation\u201d of the Constitution from the moment he takes office. \u201cHis lawyer wouldn't get a passing grade in constitutional law,\u201d Tribe told ABC News. \u201cFrom the very moment he takes the oath, he will be violating a provision of the Constitution that he takes an oath to uphold every minute of every day.\" It all comes down to the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which forbids elected officials, including the president, from accepting gifts from a foreign government. How Trump's Tweets Seem to Be Affecting Stocks and CEOs What Is the Emoluments Clause? Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution reads, \u201cNo person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state.\u201d \u201cEmolument\u201d is a fancy word that means compensation, profit or benefit. With a business empire that spans the world and includes a network of real estate properties and hotels that are patronized by representatives of foreign governments, ethics experts say Trump needs to divest himself from the company to be in compliance with the nation's laws. \u201cTo satisfy the Constitution, he needs to make sure he does not own companies that are accepting payments from foreign governments or corporations owned by foreign governments,\u201d Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told ABC News. Steve Schooner, a government procurement law expert who teaches at George Washington University, said the legal defense presented by Trump\u2019s lawyer was \u201ctoo cute by half.\u201d He explained that Trump's hotels, especially the Trump International Hotel in Washington, would have difficulty isolating the money spent by foreign governments. \u201cThe profits all get swallowed up in the bookkeeping somehow,\u201d said Schooner. \u201cIf there\u2019s a low vacancy rate one month and a big foreign delegation comes in and the hotel loses money that month but has a great weekend, there\u2019s no profit.\u201d He continued, \u201cIf the hotel is losing money and it loses less as a result, that's an emolument. There are significant benefits to the Trump business whether or not profits are recognized, not least of which is you have foreign governments hosting events there, and that's free advertising, which promotes further business with others who may want to curry favor with the president.\" One aspect of his business operations where Painter says Trump is safe legally from a Constitutional perspective is where the business only engages with U.S. citizens or private foreign clients. He offered the example of an office building in which the tenants are only American firms or privately owned foreign companies as a permissible business venture. Tribe goes further in his interpretation of the emoluments clause, arguing that complete divestment is necessary to truly adhere to the constitutional guideline set by the framers of the Constitution. \u201cThe Constitution was deliberately written to forbid a U.S. official, particularly a president, from accepting a profit from a foreign government or from some entity representing a foreign government. The reason for that was the long experience of European corruption,\u201d Tribe said. \u201cEvery minute of every day, one of his hundreds of enterprises around the world will be receiving benefits from foreign governments,\u201d he continued. It\u2019s a principle that Tribe argues extends to Trump\u2019s adult sons, who Trump announced will take over total control of the business operations when he\u2019s president. \u201cThe whole history of European corruption that our founders were trying to get away from was based on the understanding that the best way to get to the king is to give benefits to the prince,\u201d Tribe said. \u201cThe whole point of the emoluments clause is to prevent foreign governments from greasing the palm of an American official, and whether it\u2019s his own palm or the extended palm of his daughter or son doesn\u2019t make the slightest difference.\u201d Painter, in contrast, doesn\u2019t believe the clause extends to Trump\u2019s adult children, even though he says \u201cthe appearances politically are still very questionable,\u201d should foreign payments continue to flow to Trump\u2019s children. \u201cCan we hold the officeholder in violation of the Constitution because his grown children are doing business with foreign governments? I can\u2019t imagine that that would happen,\u201d Painter said. The problem, Painter says, arises with the appearance created by Trump\u2019s adult children sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders, because there is no way to ensure that they are not \u201cmixing Trump business with government business.\u201d What Can Congress Do, and Is There a Risk of Impeachment? There is one solution under which Trump can avoid the risk of violating the emoluments clause altogether: Congress can give him permission to maintain his business empire. \u201cThe emoluments clause specifically says that Congress is in charge. It can give the president permission to have what might otherwise look like a conflict of interest,\u201d Tribe said. Painter suggests that it would be an \u201cexcellent solution\u201d if Trump could work out a deal with Congress in which it shrinks the application of the emoluments clause and lays out the terms under which Trump may continue owning businesses. The big catch in that scenario, of course, is that Congress would have to go along with it \u2014 a politically risky venture for Republicans who may not want to be held responsible down the road. Painter said that it is unlikely that Trump could be sued over the matter. The enforceable body in the case of the emoluments clause is Congress. But without congressional sign-off, Painter cautions, Trump could find himself facing a hugely risky \u2014 although highly unlikely \u2014 situation: impeachment. \u201cIt Congress doesn\u2019t affirmatively give permission, he runs the risk that the next Congress is going to come back and accuse him of something,\u201d Painter said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big risk.\u201d And even though Trump may appear safe from impeachment with a Republican-controlled Congress, Tribe doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Trump\u2019s party could turn on him. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what Congress will do,\u201d Tribe said. \u201cIf they decide Mike Pence might be a safer president for them in terms of their re-election prospects, they might well bring the sword down on Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cThe very fact that he\u2019s in that day-to-day threat really distorts the whole American system of government,\u201d Tribe said. \u201cHe is a walking impeachable offense.\u201d 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY Sports Bo Jackson's football career ended - and baseball career was threatened - when he suffered a hip injury in a 1991 playoff game. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports) Bo Jackson, the world\u2019s greatest living athlete, and the only man to be an All-Star in baseball and a Pro Bowler in football, now has a confession to make. If Bo knew back in his playing days what he knows now: Bo never would have won a Heisman Trophy at Auburn. Bo never would have been inducted into the college football Hall of Fame. Bo never would have worn a Los Angeles Raiders uniform. Bo never would have trampled Brian Bosworth on Monday Night Football. And Bo never would have suffered the dislocated \u00a0left hip that ended his football career. \u201cIf I knew back then what I know now,\u2019\u2019 Jackson tells USA TODAY Sports, \u201cI would have never played football. Never. I wish I had known about all of those head injuries, but no one knew that. And the people that did know that, they wouldn\u2019t tell anybody. \u201cThe game has gotten so violent, so rough. We\u2019re so much more educated on this CTE stuff (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), there\u2019s no way I would ever allow my kids to play football today. \u201cEven though I love the sport, I\u2019d smack them in the mouth if they said they wanted to play football. \u201cI\u2019d tell them, 'Play baseball, basketball, soccer, golf, just anything but football.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Jackson was leery of the game's exploitative tendencies when he came out of Auburn - a suspicion that he says played a significant role in his shunning of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers - and that, in concert with greater knowledge of head injuries and their effect on deceased stars such as Junior Seau,forced a greater re-examination of the sport. And without football, there's no telling what Jackson might have accomplished in his other sport. Jackson, 54, who will be honored Saturday evening with the Scouts Dream Award\u00a0at the 14th annual Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation banquet in Beverly Hills, knows that football truncated his career, but he has no bitterness. If he had just stuck to baseball, perhaps he and George Brett - who will present him with his award - would not only have been former Kansas City Royals\u2019 teammates\u00a0but also fellow Hall of Famers. If he had played baseball only, perhaps every Mike Trout and Bryce Harper that comes along would be compared to Bo Jackson. \u201cYou know what,\u2019\u2019 Jackson says, \u201cI still wouldn\u2019t change a thing. The man upstairs had a plan of the way of working things out, and they did. \u201cI have no regrets.\u2019\u2019 Ready to walk away This comes from a man who was just one week away from shocking the sports world and retiring from football, focusing on his baseball career. Jackson revealed to USA TODAY Sports that he had plans to retire from the NFL after the 1990 season. He still had a contract with the Los Angeles Raiders, making the Pro Bowl that season, but planned to walk away and solely play baseball after the season ended. Instead, a hit from Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Kevin Walker on Jan. 13, 1991, forced him into retirement. The hit fractured and dislocated his left hip in the third quarter of their playoff game. Jackson thought it was simply a hip pointer, allowing him to return the next week to play against the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game. Jackson, who suffered from hip necrosis that required surgery for an artificial hip, never put on a football uniform again. \u201cThat week, three or four days before the playoff game,\u2019\u2019 Jackson says, \u201cI sat down with Linda (his wife and mother of their three children) and told her that I was going to announce my retirement. When the season was over, we had made my mind up that I was going to do that. That was the plan. \u201cWell, the man upstairs changed that plan. \u201cI\u2019m not a very religious guy, but I believe in God, and I believe God works things out for a reason. If I had retired before my contract was over, I would have probably been hated by Raiders\u00a0fans forever.\u2019\u2019 Instead, Jackson is beloved wherever he goes, well, with the exception of Tampa. 'I'm going to screw you twice as hard' Jackson, the 1985 Heisman Trophy winner, was selected by the Buccaneers with the first pick in the 1986 draft. He refused to sign. He was willing to play for any other team in the NFL, but not the Buccaneers, who were owned at the time by Hugh Culverhouse, who died in 1994. Jackson believed the Bucs were responsible for him becoming ineligible to play baseball his senior season at Auburn. They sent a private plane to pick up Jackson for a physical in Tampa\u00a0and allegedly reported the infraction to the NCAA. It was nothing more than betrayal, Jackson says, and he never forgave them. \u201cTheir people said they were looking out for me, and checked with the NCAA that it was OK for me to go on their plane for that physical,\u2019\u2019 Jackson says, \u201cbut nobody checked it out. Well, I put two and two together, and figured it out. They knew I was a first-round pick in football, but they wanted to get me away from baseball, so they got me ruled ineligible. I\u2019m 100% convinced of that. They thought that would make me forget baseball \u201cI told myself, 'All right, if you screw me, I\u2019m going to screw you twice as hard.\u2019 If anybody else had drafted me, I would have gone, but I wasn\u2019t going to play for that man. \u201cPeople thought I was crazy, but it was just morals. If you screw me over like that, and I\u2019m not part of a team yet, just think what they\u2019d do to me under contract. I couldn\u2019t do that. I needed the money. I was as poor as a Mississippi outhouse. I needed that money. But I couldn\u2019t play for that man. \u201cI also observed the way they were treating people. The fact the owners kept calling the players, 'These are my boys.\u2019 Their wives were doing the same thing.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t go there. I always believed that if you don\u2019t believe in yourself, and stand for what you believe is right, who else is going to have faith in you?\u2019\u2019 A gem on the diamond The NFL\u2019s loss was baseball\u2019s gain. Royals scout Kenny Gonzales, who died in 1994 of a heart attack, subsequently persuaded the Royals to select Jackson in the 1986 draft - burning a mere fourth-round pick. He scouted every one of Jackson\u2019s games\u00a0and was in awe of Jackson\u2019s speed, power and athletic prowess. He spent time talking with Jackson\u2019s baseball coaches, sat down with his family\u00a0and truly believed Jackson wanted to be a baseball player. \u201cHe\u2019s the reason I played baseball in Kansas City,\u2019\u2019 Jackson says. \u201cHe asked me if I was serious about playing baseball. I told him I was. \u201cThe rest is history.\u2019\u2019 Bo Jackson hit 13 home runs in 201 at-bats in 1994, his final season as a major leaguer. \u00a0(Photo: Al Bello, Getty Images) After just 53\u00a0games in the minor leagues, he was a September call-up. Jackson hit his first career home run in the seventh game, a 475-foot shot off Seattle Mariners pitcher Mike Moore, still the longest home run ever hit at Kauffman Stadium. He became an everyday player in 1987, and two years later, was the MVP of the 1989 All-Star Game, hitting 32 homers with 105 RBI in a year marked by his iconic \"Bo Knows\" Nike ad campaign. He might have been a perennial All-Star, but football never left his soul. \u00a0In 1987, a\u00a0year after he rejected the Bucs, Jackson was drafted by the Raiders in the seventh round. They offered him a five-year, $7.4 million deal. Just like that, Jackson had a new hobby. \u201cI always had it in my mind, even in college,\u2019\u2019 Jackson says, \u201cI wanted to do both sports, even at the pro level. There were only a couple of other teams out there I would have played for at that time, the Raiders and 49ers. I would have loved to play for (Hall of Fame coach) Bill Walsh. But I\u2019m thankful I got to experience Al Davis, the most charismatic owner in professional sports to this day. He was an icon.\u2019\u2019 Everything changed, of course, on that January afternoon in 1991. The fractured hip led to hip necrosis, which led to hip replacement surgery. Jackson played parts of three more seasons with the Chicago White Sox and California Angels, but never again was the same. His last game as an athlete was Aug. 10, 1994, getting a single in his final at-bat off Tom \u201cFlash\u2019\u2019 Gordon in a 2-1 victory over the Royals. The Major League Baseball Players Association went on strike the next day, and the World Series was cancelled a month later, quietly ending Jackson\u2019s career. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, I\u2019ve got no regrets,\u2019\u2019 Jackson says. \u201cI know Bo Jackson was good for professional sports at one time. I know pro sports was great for Bo Jackson, then and now.\u2019\u2019 Jackson lends his name to a training facility in Illinois, Bo Jackson's Elite Sports, and maintains business relationships with Nike and Gatorade, but otherwise maintains a quiet\u00a0profile. He rarely watches sporting events these days. He missed the 2015 Royals\u2019 World Series championship. He skipped the Raiders\u2019 wild-card playoff game. He didn\u2019t bother watching Clemson\u2019s national championship victory against his old rivals, Alabama, although he does attend the occasional game at Auburn. Bo Jackson walks the sidelines during Auburn's game against Arkansas on Oct .22. \u00a0(Photo: John Reed, John Reed-USA TODAY Sports) \u201cI\u2019m not a good spectator, I get bored watching,\u2019\u2019 Jackson says, \u201cbut I sure loved playing the game. I loved the competition. I loved being better than the next guy. I enjoyed watching people\u2019s eyes jump out of their heads watching me do something that was normal to me. \u201cSo there\u2019s no reason for anyone to feel sorry for what happened to me, or what might have been. I didn\u2019t play sports to make it to the Hall of Fame. I just played for the love of sport. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what my stats were, but I know I\u2019m still reaping the benefits, enjoying the accolades, and all of the awards that still come to me. \u201cI\u2019m blessed. \u201cThings turned out all right.\u2019\u2019 GALLERY: The greatest two-sport stars ",

He is flanked by Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci (left) and Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades (right) in Geneva, Switzerland. Anadolu Agency/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Secretary General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres (center) makes a statement Thursday. He is flanked by Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci (left) and Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades (right) in Geneva, Switzerland. Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The U.N. Secretary-General said today he was hopeful that peace talks on Cyprus, being held in Geneva, could lead to a breakthrough, though he cautioned that \"we are not here for a quick fix.\" Flanked by Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci and Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said a breakthrough is what the world needs now. \"We are facing so many situations of disasters. We badly need a symbol of hope. I strongly believe Cyprus can be the symbol of hope at the beginning of 2017,\" Guterres added. Source: CIA Factbook Credit: Alyson Hurt/NPR The island in the Mediterranean has been divided since 1974, when \"Turkish troops invaded following a Greek-backed coup,\" as NPR's Michele Kelemen reports. The Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities are separated by a U.N. buffer zone, and \"many attempts to reunite the island have failed,\" Michele adds. But this past week has seen two significant events that may indicate a changing climate for peace. This is first time that the so-called \"guarantor powers\" \u2013 Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom \u2013 have participated in the talks. Their foreign ministers attended today's discussions. Article continues after sponsorship It's also the first time the two sides have exchanged proposed maps. These talks aim to create a federation composed of two states, one representing the Greek Cypriot community and the other representing the Turkish Cypriot community. The two sides are therefore proposing where to draw the administrative boundary between the two states on the map. The boundary proposals will be locked in a U.N. vault and not presented publicly \"because of the extreme sensitivity of the issue,\" Espen Barth Eide, special adviser to the secretary-general on Cyprus, told reporters yesterday . During his remarks, Eide outlined just how emotionally charged these issues are. On the Greek Cypriot side, there's the \"historical trauma\" of \"the loss of land and property where people used to live.\" On the Turkish Cypriot side, there are \"a number of people that have been living their lives normally for generations ... in exactly the same place, people who themselves might have been displaced in the south, who have established new lives.\" But he says that the week has seen significant progress already. \"We have dealt with some of the most difficult issues,\" he said. \"We have touched upon almost all of them. We have solved many of them, and we are close to resolving some other issues.\" Any peace plan would need to be approved in referendums by each side. One major unresolved issue is what will happen to the property that Greek Cypriots fled from in 1974, the BBC explained: \"Should they get the right to take their old homes back, or be compensated \u2013 and if so by how much?\" Questions surrounding security were a focus of today's discussions. As the BBC put it : \"How can the security of the Turkish Cypriots be guaranteed if Turkey's estimated 30,000 troops leave? Greek Cypriots see them as an occupying force, so should some stay or should Turkey retain the right to intervene?\" Eide stressed that this current moment presents the \"best chance\" for peace, and the climate is unlikely to get better: \"There is simply nothing in the trend lines that I see internationally that suggests that the world is getting more constructive, that people are coming together more, that problems are more easily overcome, that we get a world leadership that is more helpful, so I don't really see what we would be gaining from waiting.\" ",

    "text": "By Mike DeBonis January 12 at 5:56 PM Follow @mikedebonis House Republican leaders attempted to quell concerns of a skittish rank and file before a key vote Friday to begin unwinding the Affordable Care Act. The assurances came after lawmakers across the GOP\u2019s ideological divides sounded anxious notes this week about advancing legislation that would repeal Obamacare without firm plans for its replacement. \u201cWe just want more specifics,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Wednesday. \u201cWe need to know what we\u2019re going to replace it with.\u201d Meadows said he was personally undecided on his vote Friday and that other caucus members were leaning toward no. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, said members of that caucus have \u201cserious reservations\u201d about starting the process without replacement plans spelled out. \u201cWe\u2019d like to have this conversation prior to the repeal vote,\u201d he said. Those jitters hint at a rocky road ahead as Republicans start trying to fulfill a long-standing campaign promise. They have forced GOP leaders to reassure lawmakers that they will not move precipitously and open Republicans to charges they threw the health-care system into chaos. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) \u201cThis will be a thoughtful, step-by-step process,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to swap one 2,700-page monstrosity for another. . . . We\u2019re going to do this the right way.\u201d The House is set to vote Friday on a measure that would begin the budget reconciliation process, which ultimately would allow Republicans to repeal Obamacare without securing cooperation from Democrats who have vowed to block any major changes to the law. GOP leadership aides said they were confident the measure would pass Friday, but the vote could still be close \u2014 reflecting significant tactical differences on an issue that Republicans have long touted as a chief priority should their party regain the White House. House action is expected to come barely 24 hours after Senate passage of the measure. Only one senator, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), crossed party lines \u2014 arguing, in part, that the GOP should put forth an Obamacare replacement first. [ Obamacare is one step closer to repeal after Senate advances budget resolution ] Complicating matters is President-elect Donald Trump, who this week made several sweeping statements about the timing and substance of his health-care plans. Replacement of Obamacare, Trump said at a Wednesday news conference, would happen \u201cessentially simultaneously\u201d as its repeal and would be \u201cfar less expensive and far better.\u201d In a New York Times interview published Tuesday, Trump indicated that legislation could come together within weeks. Trump tweeted praise Thursday for the Senate\u2019s swift action, which could help goad skeptical House Republicans: \u201cCongrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare- now it\u2019s onto the House!\u201d But several key lawmakers involved in the process indicated that Trump is pushing an overly ambitious timeline. Democrats took more than a year to pass the ACA and related legislation, and they had a filibuster-proof 60-vote Senate majority for much of that time. \u201cI guess it depends on how you define \u2018simultaneous,\u2019 \u201d said Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health, when asked Wednesday about Trump\u2019s comments. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different timelines floating around.\u201d \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of energy for getting on with both\u201d repeal and replacement, he said. \u201cThe question is, what are the formalities for that? We want to have a due process here, we want to have a transparent process. We want to have a full legislative process.\u201d Another wild card is Trump\u2019s pick for health and human services secretary, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.). Trump suggested Wednesday that Price would play a key role in shaping the Obamacare replacement strategy. \u201cAs soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we\u2019ll be filing a plan,\u201d he said. It was unclear whether he meant a legislative plan, or a plan for repealing or modifying Obamacare-related regulations. House leaders see Price, the House Budget Committee chairman and an orthopedist, as a reliable partner. But it is unclear how quickly he might be confirmed: The Senate Finance Committee has yet to set confirmation hearings, and Democrats have vowed to undertake a no-holds-barred blitz on Price\u2019s record. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to get Dr. Price in as secretary,\u201d said Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key to working with us, and we obviously know a lot about what he thinks about.\u201d Ryan said Thursday that he and Trump are \u201ccompletely in sync\u201d on health care and suggested that more details would be on offer at the yearly congressional Republican retreat, which will be held in Philadelphia the week after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Trump is scheduled to address lawmakers there. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a full, exhausting conversation at our retreat to go through all of these things,\u201d Ryan said Thursday. \u201cWhat I think people are beginning to appreciate is, we have lots of tools in front of us. It\u2019s not just a one-and-done-bill kind of a thing. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been walking our members through, are all the options available to us to get this done.\u201d One of the those tools, he said, is budget reconciliation \u2014 a process that will pave the way for Republicans to pass a bill gutting major parts of the ACA, including the system of tax subsidies and penalties that Democrats relied on to increase coverage levels. GOP leaders are examining closely what elements of a replacement plan can be included in a repeal bill set to be passed under reconciliation. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said Thursday that the repeal measure could include some attempts to empower states to begin making health-care coverage decisions before a replacement bill is complete. Still, Senate rules dictate that only measures with a discrete budgetary effect are permissible under reconciliation. So while Republicans could claim that the bill repealing Obamacare also contains a blueprint for its replacement, major parts of that replacement plan would need 60 Senate votes \u2014 and thus significant Democratic support. According to multiple GOP sources, Republicans are looking at whether to use reauthorizations of existing programs, such as the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, as vehicles for replacement measures. That could give them leverage to secure cooperation from Democrats. Behind the scenes, Republican leaders are urging lawmakers to look at this week\u2019s votes as mere procedural formalities. But some rank-and-file members remain nervous about voting to start a process they might not be able to stop. \u201cI told my members, in order to have a meaningful impact . . . you better speak up now,\u201d Dent said.

Frank Milstead, director of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, said after he met with the seriously injured trooper at the hospital. Thanks for the thoughts and prayers this morning for our Trooper that was shot. Looks like he will be okay after some recovery @Arizona_DPS \u2014 Col. Frank Milstead (@frank_milstead) January 12, 2017 The trooper \u2014 a 27-year veteran who hasn't been identified but was reported as stable with gunshot wounds in his chest and right shoulder \u2014 was responding to reports that shots had been fired at about 4 a.m. (6 a.m. ET) on Interstate 10 about 40 miles west of Phoenix, Milstead said. On the way, the trooper spotted a rollover accident, stopped to investigate and began blocking off the scene. A woman who was believed to have been ejected from the vehicle was later determined to have died at the scene, authorities said. Emergency personnel at the scene where an Arizona state trooper was shot Thursday morning on Interstate 10 near Tonopah. Mark Henle / AP \"As the trooper exited his vehicle and began to lay out flares, it appears at this point that he was ambushed by the suspect,\" Milstead said. \"In the initial confrontation, the suspect shoots the trooper in the shoulder [and] right chest area at least one time, possibly twice, disabling the use of the trooper's right hand and right arm.\" The gunman then attacked the trooper with his hands, bashing his head into the pavement, Milstead said. That's when the passing motorist stopped. \"The trooper says, 'Please help me,' and asks the uninvolved third party for help,\" Milstead said. \"That person retreats back to his vehicle, removes his own weapon from the vehicle, confronts the suspect, giving him orders to stop assaulting the officer. The suspect refuses. The uninvolved third party fires, striking and killing the suspect.\" The hero driver was identified only as a man who was traveling to California with his wife. A second motorist who also stopped at the scene ran to the trooper's vehicle, grabbed its radio and called for help. Emergency personnel at the scene where an Arizona state trooper was shot Thursday morning on Interstate 10 near Tonopah. Mark Henle / AP \"My concern was his life,\" that second motorist, Brian Schober, of Scottsdale, Arizona, told NBC News on Thursday. He wouldn't give any other details except to say he and the man who shot the suspect had been able to meet each other and say thank you. According to a recording of the police radio exchange, Schober told a dispatcher: \"Hello, officer down, officer down outside Tonopah. Come in, please. This is a civilian. He's shot on I-10 on the eastbound lane \u2014 sorry, westbound lane.\" Schober continued: \"He's in real bad shape. Please send air support, helicopter, please. There are also two civilians on \u2014 off \u2014 [the] road also laying [in] unknown condition.\" The dispatcher began coordinating an emergency response, keeping Schober on the radio before asking for a status report. \"I believe he was in an altercation with a motorist,\" he responded. \"There's a lady laying on the road, uh, still moving, not dead. The other gentleman was shot by a passerby who, uh, stopped the altercation after the officer was shot. ... \"The suspect is occasionally snorting or breathing. He's been shot by the passerby. He's laying right next to the officer,\" Schober reported. Emergency personnel at the scene where an Arizona state trooper was shot Thursday morning on Interstate 10 near Tonopah. KPNX-TV via NBC News Channel Milstead said few other details were immediately available because the investigation was still in its early stages. \"We don't know what the story is, and we'll figure that out as time goes on,\" he said. But one thing was clear, he said: \"In our worst hour, we may need your help, and this was today. ... Thank you. Thank you for the support.\" Alex Johnson ",

The National Weather Service said Thursday that the potential for a significant ice storm has been increasing. Forecasters say parts of Oklahoma , Kansas and Missouri could see up to 1 inch of ice, causing widespread power outages and making roads impassable. Storms are expected Friday, Saturday and Sunday. A winter storm watch is in effect beginning Friday morning for much of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, along with parts of Illinois and Texas. Ice accumulations and winds of up to 15 mph are forecast for much of the area. Heavy rain is likely further south. 0 Shares ",

Embed Embed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are ready to repeal Obamacare, and fast. Cliff Owen/AP hide caption toggle caption Cliff Owen/AP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are ready to repeal Obamacare, and fast. Cliff Owen/AP At about 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, Republicans moved one step closer to repealing a law they have railed against since the moment it was passed nearly seven years ago. By a final vote of 51-48, the Senate approved a budget resolution that sets the stage for broad swaths of the Affordable Care Act to be repealed through a process known as budget reconciliation. The resolution now goes to the House, where leaders are hoping to approve it by the end of the week. Work continues on the ceremonial stage on the Capitol's west front for Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. AP hide caption toggle caption AP Work continues on the ceremonial stage on the Capitol's west front for Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. AP The powerful tool sets up a fast track for repealing large parts of Barack Obama's major domestic achievement; the best guess is that the Senate is still several weeks away from largely repealing Obamacare. But as the process continues, large questions still loom over how \u2014 and when \u2013 Republicans will replace the health care law. An expedited repeal, starting with a vote-a-rama The vote took place during a session known as a \"vote-a-rama.\" These all-night vote-fests happen surrounding budget resolutions, which allow senators to propose unlimited amendments, as the New York Times' Thomas Kaplan explained this week. The passage of the resolution kicks off the budget reconciliation process. That process is special because a reconciliation measure cannot be filibustered, meaning it allows the Senate to pass a bill with a simple majority (as opposed to needing 60 votes to overcome a filibuster). That's good for Republicans, who hold 52 of the Senate's 100 seats. Article continues after sponsorship 6 Lesser-Known Obamacare Provisions That Could Evaporate Once the House approves the measure, which could happen as soon as Friday, committees from both chambers will meet to create instructions telling the budget committee what repeal should look like. Once repeal legislation is drafted, both houses can pass it with a simple majority, and then it would go to President Trump for signature. Should that repeal legislation pass both houses and be signed by a President Trump, it would cut out important provisions of Obamacare, but would still not repeal the entire law. Budget reconciliation only allows Congress to repeal parts of the bill \u2014 more specifically, the parts that deal with how much the government spends or taxes people. That means this process can't repeal, for example, the parts of the bill that allow young adults to stay on their parents' insurance or the rules saying companies couldn't deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. But those are the parts of the law that end up costing a lot of money, while the parts that can be repealed through budget reconciliation \u2014 like the mandate that people have coverage (which is enforced through a tax), billions of dollars in Medicaid funds and subsidies for private coverage \u2014 bring money into the system to help balance out the cost equation. Democrats try to send their own messages Democrats went into Wednesday night with a messaging plan: Use vote-a-rama to get Republicans on the record about what may come next. That plan consisted of proposing amendment after amendment to force Republicans to vote on Medicaid expansion, funding for rural hospitals, women's access to health care and other popular programs. Democrats know this is a train they can't stop. As the night drew to a close, all they could do was stage a protest. Senators aren't supposed to give speeches during a vote, but Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a disabled Iraq War veteran, ignored the rule. As the presiding senator was gaveling for order, Duckworth said, \"For all those with pre-existing conditions, I stand on prosthetic legs to vote no!\" The gaveling continued as Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., said, \"I vote no on behalf of the more than 2.3 million Minnesotans who can no longer be discriminated against because of the ACA!\" What's next (and when)? That's complicated... Republicans are united on wanting to repeal Obamacare. But they're more divided over the timeframe of that repeal, as well as what happens next. At one point, it appeared likely that congressional Republicans would take a \"repeal and delay\" approach \u2014 that is, pass repeal legislation that would only be implemented far down the road, to allow time to craft a replacement for Obamacare. But now divisions are growing. House Speaker Paul Ryan this week said he would like a repeal and a replacement for Obamacare to come \"concurrently.\" And in a Wednesday press conference , President-elect Donald Trump indicated that he would like the two to happen in quick succession, though he didn't provide much more clarity on that timeframe. \"It will be repeal and replace. It will be, essentially simultaneously,\" he said, later adding, \"It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week \u2014 but probably the same day \u2014 could be a same hour.\" Other Republicans, however, believe the process won't be so abbreviated. \"I don't see any possibility of our being able to come up with a comprehensive reform bill that would replace Obamacare by the end of this month,\" said Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins. Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson also seemed to say on Tuesday that the process could take a while, involving multiple intermediate steps. As he told WBUR's Here and Now : \"If you had a bridge that's about ready to collapse, you know, the first thing you would do is you'd start working to repair that bridge,\" he said. \"You aren't going to blow it up; I mean, at least people have a bridge to use. Repair that so people can use it while you start building other bridges.\" Collins is one of five Republican senators who this week proposed that the resolution provide more time for committees to craft their instructions. One big concern for Republicans here is repealing a law they detest without disrupting the lives of the roughly 20 million people insured because of that law, including 6.4 million Americans insured through ACA exchanges. Americans definitely want some sort of change \u2014 in an NPR-Ipsos poll released Thursday , 38 percent said the ACA should be \"strengthened or expanded,\" and close behind, 31 percent said it should be repealed and replaced. Meanwhile, only 6 percent said it should be \"left as-is\" (the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points). With reporting from Susan Davis. ",

The Justice Department's initial report, in some investigations, has laid the groundwork for a consent decree that includes specific reforms overseen by an outside monitor. This can take months, however. The DOJ is currently enforcing 20 consent decrees and agreements around the country, and including Chicago there are five ongoing investigations. On Thursday, the department announced that a consent decree had been reached with the city of Baltimore, although the agreement needs to be approved in the U.S. District Court for Maryland. It's unclear, however, how President-elect Donald Trump's administration will handle civil rights investigations going forward. Ongoing Department of Justice investigations and enforcements Consent decree or other type of agreement Open investigation Note: There are two ongoing investigations in Orange County, Calif. The DOJ is enforcing two agreements on Maricopa County, Ariz., a consent decree and a post-judgment order. Sources: Department of Justice and Tribune reporting. Other investigations The Department of Justice has opened more than 60 investigations into law enforcement departments since 1994, when the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act was passed in the aftermath of the Rodney King beating case. In 2008, the south suburban Harvey Police Department was investigated by the DOJ, which announced in 2012 that it hadn't found a pattern of constitutional or federal law violations. But it said the local department's system for reporting and reviewing use of force was \"grossly deficient,\" creating a \"high risk of excessive force.\" ",

USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Vice President Joe Biden in the State Dining Room of the White House Thursday. (Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama bestowed the nation's highest civilian honor on Vice President Biden Thursday, calling his running mate and presidential understudy \"the best vice president America has ever had.\" The surprise State Room ceremony was alternately humorous and poignant, with Biden turning his face from the audience to wipe away his tears. \"I had no inkling,\" Biden said, saying he thought the event was supposed to be for first lady Michelle Obama. He jokingly fired his chief of staff for not telling him. \"I don't deserve this, but I\u00a0know this came from the president's heart.\" Only two other men have received the honor for their service as vice presidents.. President Gerald Ford awarded it to his vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, in 1977, and President Jimmy Carter awarded it to Lyndon Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, in 1980. Posted!

That additional designation has been bestowed to only three others: Pope John Paul II, President Ronald Reagan and former secretary of State Colin Powell. \"It is, as Joe once said, a big ... deal,\" a straight-faced Obama joked, referring to Biden's expletive-laden remark on the passage of the Affordable Care Act. \"He has made me a better president, and a better commander in chief,\" Obama said. \"When everyone else has cleared out of the room, he's been unafraid to give it to me straight, even when we disagree. Especially when we disagreed.\" Read more: Obama's farewell address looks back on career in activism Obama recited a list of Biden's accomplishments as vice president, leading the Middle Class Task Force, serving as the stimulus \"sheriff,\" and manning \"mission control\" for the Cancer Moonshot. But he said those items do not capture the fullness of Biden's often-parodied persona. \"I have not mentioned Amtrak yet. Or aviators. Literally,\" Obama said. In his farewell address in Chicago \u00a0on Tuesday, Obama called Biden a \"great vice president\" and a \"brother.\"\u00a0On Thursday, joking about the close friendship they've had, Obama joked that one last joint event \"also gives the Internet one last chance to talk about our bromance,\" he said. Biden accepted the award with an off-the-cuff speech in characteristic fashion, reciting Irish poems, Talmudic sayings and inside stories. He told of the time, six months into his presidency, when Obama told him, \"You know what surprised me is how we\u2019ve become such good friends.\" \"I said, 'surprised you?'\" Biden said, incredulously. \"That is candid Obama.\" \"There is no power in the vice presidency,\" Biden said. \"There is no inherent\u00a0power, nor should there be. But Mr. President, you have more than kept your commitment to me by saying to me you wanted me to help govern.\" Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 The tweet came in response to public attention over Linda Bean's political support for Trump. Bean, a board member and co-owner of the family-owned outdoor retailer and the granddaughter of company founder Leon Leonwood Bean, says she gave money to a PAC supporting Trump. The Associated Press reported that her donations totaled $30,000 \u2014 exceeding limits on individual contributions in a single year. (The news service says the PAC, Making Maine Great Again, initially reported Bean contributed $60,000 but amended its filings.) Her political stance drew criticism from some liberals, who called for a boycott of the company under the hashtag #Grabyourwallet. That prompted the company to respond, noting that Linda Bean's views did not reflect on the company or the views of other Bean family members. Article continues after sponsorship ",

Sanders criticized Democratic senators who voted against legislation to allow drugs to be imported from Canada and other countries. (Photo: Tina MacIntyre-Yee, USA TODAY Network) WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday blasted 13 Senate Democrats for lacking the \u201cguts\u201d to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry after they voted against a measure he pushed to help drive down drug costs by importing them from Canada. The Vermont Independent and former Democratic presidential candidate said during a Thursday interview he plans to personally speak with the senators who opposed the measure \u2014 which failed 52-46 on\u00a0Wednesday \u2014\u00a0and try to turn them around. A dozen Republicans voted in favor. \u201cThe Democratic Party has got to make it very clear that they are prepared to stand up to powerful special interests like the pharmaceutical industry and like Wall Street, and they\u2019re not going to win elections and they\u2019re not going to be doing the right thing for the American people unless they have the guts to do that,\u201d said Sanders, the leader of outreach efforts for Senate Democrats.\u00a0\u201cThat 13 Democrats did not is disappointing. I absolutely hope that in the coming weeks and months you\u2019re going to see many of them develop the courage to stand up to Pharma.\u201d The measure by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sanders would have allowed pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacists to import low-cost medicine from Canada and other countries. Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Bob Menendez and Cory Booker of New Jersey, Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray of Washington, Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Jon Tester of Montana and Mark Warner of Virginia all voted against it. Several senators said they voted for other measures to drive down drug costs and they cited safety concerns as the reason for their opposition to the Klobuchar-Sanders measure. \u201cThe Food and Drug Administration has testified before the Senate that they are unable to certify that the mass, wholesale importation of medications from other countries, even Canada, would be safe, authentic or efficacious,\u201d Menendez said.\u00a0 \u201cAllowing unknown drugs to be imported by uncertified and unverifiedInternet\u00a0pharmacies undermines that trust and puts the well-being of patients at serious risk.\u201d Menendez, Booker and Carper said in statements that they have previously supported bills to allow for drug importation. But Carper, pointing to instances where the FDA discovered counterfeit drugs, said \u201cwe can't afford to risk the health and well-being of our patients.\u201d Sanders said he agrees the medicine should be safe, but he believes that can easily be accomplished. \u201cIf we can import vegetables and fish and poultry and beef from all corners of the Earth, please don\u2019t tell me that we cannot bring in, from Canada and other major countries, name brand prescription drugs of some of the largest corporations in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a laughable statement.\u201d Read more: Democrats call for rallies nationwide to oppose GOP on health care Sanders pointed to research showing some of the highest prices in the world for drugs are in the United States. It\u2019s encouraging, he said, that 12 Republicans voted for the measure, and he hopes more will sign on following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s statement Wednesday that the pharmaceutical industry is \"getting away with murder\" for what they charge the federal government for drugs. \u201cIf that\u2019s what Donald Trump can say publicly, surely these 13 Democrats can stand up to Pharma, and I intend to do everything I can to see that happen,\u201d he said. The Klobuchar-Sanders measure was among numerous proposed amendments \u2014 all of which failed \u2014\u00a0to a 2017 budget resolution that the Senate passed to help pave the way for a quick repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Sanders along with House and Senate Democratic leaders, organized 40 rallies across the country for this Sunday to show grass-roots support for the law. Sanders will attend a rally with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York in Michigan because he said the Democratic Party must reconnect with working people in the Midwest \u2014 and understand that the repeal of Obamacare can\u2019t be defeated without grass-roots support. \u201cThe Democrats for too many years have not had the kind of contact and interaction with working people, with elderly people, with lower income people, than they should,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cToo many Democrats spend too much time raising money from the wealthy rather than standing up and hearing and listening to the needs of working families. And I want to see that changed.\u201d A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Bills Require Presidential Candidates to Release Tax Returns By cathy bussewitz, associated press HONOLULU \u0097 Jan 12, 2017, 4:00 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Addresses Russian Hacking, His Business Future, 'Obamacare' Plans in Press Conference 0 Shares Email Lawmakers in Hawaii and several other states want to prevent presidential candidates from appearing on their states' ballots unless the candidates release their tax returns. They're responding to President-elect Donald Trump's decision to not release his tax returns during the presidential campaign, breaking decades of precedent. The Hawaii bill would require candidates to release five years of federal and state tax returns to qualify for the ballot, state Rep. Chris Lee said Wednesday. Similar proposals are circulating in California, Massachusetts, New Mexico and the District of Columbia . \"It's a reasonable step since every modern president has released their tax returns and put their assets into a blind trust to make sure the only interest they have is the interest of our country and its people,\" Lee said. \"I think we're in a very dangerous climate in which that could change.\" Lee consulted with lawyers who assured him it's legal, and if the bill passes it will undergo a thorough review from the state attorney general, he said. Lee is still working out details on the Hawaii bill, but he plans to include a way to make the tax returns public. In the Massachusetts bill, that state's Secretary of State would be required to make the tax returns public within a month of each vote. \"If even one or two states take action, it changes the game,\" Lee said. Trump has interests in 500 companies in about 20 countries, according to a disclosure document released in May. California state Sens. Scott Wiener and Mike McGuire are planning to introduce similar legislation, saying financial information should be made available to voters to build critical public trust. A District of Columbia lawmaker plans to introduce a similar bill. The District's three electoral votes have gone to the Democratic candidate in every election since city residents were granted the right to vote for president in 1961. Nationwide, about two-thirds of registered voters said it's somewhat or very important for presidential candidates to release their tax returns, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll in September. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press Writer Ben Nuckols contributed to this report from Washington. 0 Shares ",

Several children and an adult were taken to an area hospital. Six children are still missing. (Jerry Jackson/The Baltimore Sun via AP) Firefighters have recovered the bodies of six children Thursday after a fire broke out overnight at their family home in northeast Baltimore. Firefighters were called to the three-story house at around 12:30 a.m. and found it engulfed in flames. The woman who lived in the home, identified as Katie Malone, is the mother of nine children who lived in the home along with their father, who was at work at the time of the fire. Malone and three of her children escaped the home. The children confirmed dead are two boys, ages 9 months and 2 years; 3-year-old twin girls; and two girls, ages 10 and 11, Clark said. Fire officials said Malone and a 4 and a 5-year-old boy were hospitalized in critical condition, while another children, an 8-year-old girl was in serious condition. The little girl is said to be \u201cin good shape\u201d and could be released later in the day, WBBF reported.

William Malone said all nine are his children with Katie, who's a staff member for Rep. Elijah Cummings' district office. He told The Associated Press that he was not home at the time of the fire because he was at work for a restaurant. \"I'm still in shock to be honest,\" said Malone, who was reached by phone at a relative's home. He said he does not know what may have caused the fire. Cummings said Katie Malone has worked as a special assistant in his Catonsville office for nearly 11 years. \"My staff is a family and this unimaginable tragedy is shocking and heartbreaking to us all. I again ask for your prayers,\" Cummings said in a statement. Michael Johnson, 55, who lives a block away and can see the house from his home, described it as a complete inferno.

It just kept coming and coming and coming. Fire was actually coming out of the sides of the house. I've never seen anything like that in my life,\" Johnson said. Johnson, who didn't know the family, added that he was praying for the people inside. \"It was just so intense,\" he said. \"I didn't think anyone would be able to survive it at all.\" Baltimore City Schools' CEO Dr. Santelises said in statement, \"I am heartbroken by the devastating reports of last night's fire, and I pray for the children and family who were trapped in this tragedy. We are waiting for more complete information on those involved, and we will do everything in our power to support their families and schools. Our thanks go out to the first responders who fought so valiantly to save those inside.\" The third floor collapsed and the second floor partially collapsed, fire department spokesman Chief Roman Clark said. The blaze is contained, but hasn't been brought under control. The cause is under investigation, but investigators haven't been able to enter the building. Crews were awaiting the arrival of heavy-duty equipment that would help them remove debris from the dwelling, he said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Got it President-elect Donald Trump walks out with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis after a meeting at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster Township, N.J. on Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Karen Tumulty January 12 at 7:13 PM Follow @ktumulty Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees, in their first round of confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill, have one after another contradicted the president-elect on key issues, promising to trim back or disregard some of the signature promises on which he campaigned. A fresh round of examples came in the third day of hearings on Thursday. Retired Gen. James Mattis, Trump\u2019s nominee for defense secretary, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the United States must honor the \u201cimperfect arms control agreement\u201d with Iran that Trump has vowed to dismantle because \u201cwhen America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.\u201d He also took a more adversarial stance than Trump toward Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, and cited Moscow as one of the nation\u2019s top threats. \u201cI\u2019ve never found a better guide for the way ahead than studying the histories. Since Yalta, we have a long list of times we\u2019ve tried to engage positively with Russia. We have a relatively short list of successes in that regard,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cI think right now the most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with Mr. Putin and we recognize that he is trying to break the North Atlantic alliance.\u201d (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) At another witness table in another Senate hearing room, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), whom Trump picked to head the CIA, assured the Intelligence Committee that he would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d use brutal interrogation tactics on terrorism suspects in contravention of the law, even if ordered to do so by a president-elect who campaigned on a promise to reinstate them. The discordant notes that cabinet nominees have struck as they have been questioned by senators suggests that a reality check may lie ahead for Trump. It may be that the grandiosity and disregard for convention that got Trump elected were inevitably bound for a collision course with the practical and legal limitations of governing. \u201cHis rhetoric was so far outside the boundaries \u2014 in some instances of reality, and in some instances of the laws of the nation, and in other issues, outside the boundaries of pass-fail issues for some of these nominees,\u201d said Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, who as an aide to former President George W. Bush oversaw the confirmation process for the Supreme Court nominations of Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts. The American system of government places \u201cextraordinary constraints\u201d on even a president\u2019s power, Schmidt said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the reality-show aspects of campaigning bending to the reality of governance.\u201d But others say that Trump is such a singular figure, whose fervent supporters are convinced that he can topple the established order in Washington, that it is impossible to predict how things will play out once he is inaugurated. \u201cWe are in such uncharted territory with this guy,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, director of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Effective Public Management. \u201cThe interesting thing will be, does Trump pay attention to what his government does?\u201d (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The comments by Mattis and Pompeo on Thursday continued a pattern set in the first two days of hearings. On Tuesday, retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, nominated to head the Department of Homeland Security, had downplayed the significance of Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall on the Mexican border, saying \u201ca physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job.\u201d And Kelly, too, disavowed torture, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should ever come close to crossing a line that is beyond what we as Americans would expect to follow in terms of interrogation techniques.\u201d In 2009, President Obama signed an executive order that bars the CIA from using interrogation methods beyond those permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manual. That excludes such measures as waterboarding. Trump, on the other hand, argued during his campaign that \u201ctorture works.\u201d He vowed to resume it \u201cimmediately,\u201d and to come up with \u201cmuch worse.\u201d On Wednesday, secretary of state-designate Rex Tillerson contradicted the president-elect\u2019s repeated suggestions that climate change is a hoax, and said it is important for this country to \u201cmaintain its seat at the table on the conversations around how to address the threats of climate change, which do require a global response.\u201d As a candidate, Trump had said he would withdraw the United States from a 2015 international accord to reduce greenhouse gases, though he has since softened that stance and said he is keeping \u201can open mind to it.\u201d That Trump\u2019s nominees would air their disagreements with the president-elect at their confirmation hearings is \u201cextraordinarily unusual,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cThe first thing a president and a transition team does is make sure the president and his cabinet are on the same page.\u201d But it may be that they have not yet even discussed their differences at all. Among the startling turns in the confirmation hearings has been the revelation by some of Trump\u2019s nominees that they have not had detailed conversations with the president-elect about critical issues that will fall within their portfolios. Tillerson, for example, told the Foreign Relations Committee that he and Trump had discussed foreign policy \u201cin a broad construct and in terms of the principles that are going to guide that.\u201d \u201cI would have thought that Russia would be at the very top of that considering all the actions that have taken place,\u201d Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) pressed. \u201cDid that not happen?\u201d \u201cThat has not occurred yet, senator,\u201d Tillerson replied. Kelly made a similar comment when he was asked about the fate of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who have applied for protection from deportation under the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive action. In his campaign, Trump vowed to \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d the program. \u201cThe entire development of immigration policy is ongoing right now in terms of the upcoming administration. I have not been involved in those discussions,\u201d said Kelly, who is slated to head a sprawling department that includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One question is whether his appointees will convince Trump to moderate some of the strident positions that he took during his presidential campaign. He has already indicated that they have influenced his thinking in some areas. During an interview with the New York Times shortly after his election, for instance, Trump had said that Mattis had made the case \u201ca pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers\u201d were more effective in getting information from terrorism suspects than waterboarding and similarly controversial techniques. \u201cI was very impressed by that answer,\u201d Trump said. Another unknown, however, is how the cabinet appointees\u2019 views will mesh with senior members of Trump\u2019s White House staff, who do not undergo confirmation by the Senate. Tillerson, for example, said under questioning by the Foreign Relations Committee that supporting human rights globally is \u201dwithout question\u201d in the long-term national security interests on the United States. But at a forum a day earlier at the United States Institute of Peace, KT McFarland, who will be Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser contended that Trump will take foreign policy in a less idealistic direction. \u201cThe mistake that we make is that we constantly tell other countries how they should think,\u201d McFarland said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that we can start seeing things through their eyes. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

By Missy Ryan and Dan Lamothe January 12 at 6:24 PM Follow @missy_ryan Follow @danlamothe Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. defense secretary, placed Russia first among principal threats facing the United States, arguing for greater American support for European allies to counter what he said were Moscow\u2019s attempts to shatter the North Atlantic security alliance. Mattis, a respected combat leader who made his name in the wars following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, cautioned that sustained cuts to military budgets and personnel meant the U.S. military is no longer strong enough to easily outmatch Russia and other adversaries. Mattis\u2019s remarks during his confirmation hearing Thursday provide some of the first hints about how the Trump administration, which has not put forward comprehensive national security plans, may alter the posture of the world\u2019s most advanced military at a time of institutional strain and uncertainty about the future. [ Trump\u2019s pick for CIA leader would refuse to restart enhanced interrogation techniques ] His comments also signal a possible divergence in viewpoint with the president-elect, who has questioned long-standing security commitments and voiced his willingness to partner with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. Trump said at a news conference Wednesday that \u201cRussia can help us fight\u201d the Islamic State, but he also noted: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t.\u201d 1 of 51 See photos from the confirmation hearings of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees View Photos The Senate is getting an early start on the president-elect\u2019s choices for several top jobs in his administration.

Jan. 12, 2017\u00a0 Ben Carson, the nominee to be the Housing and Urban Development secretary, pauses while answering questions from the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Mattis\u2019s seeming differences with Trump and those with the president-elect\u2019s pick to be secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who unlike Mattis has suggested that he might support renegotiating President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran, could lead to a fractious approach to foreign policy and interagency feuding in the next administration. Mattis spoke as Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), whom Trump has tapped to lead the CIA, pushed back on Trump\u2019s support for waterboarding during the campaign and said he would reject orders to torture detainees. The conflicting statements from the men who will be Trump\u2019s most senior advisers increase uncertainty about what actions the new administration will take as military leaders continue to battle the Islamic State and grapple with growing challenges from China and North Korea. Several hours after Mattis\u2019s testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senate voted 81 to 17 to waive a measure requiring defense secretaries to have been out of military service for seven years. Mattis retired in 2013. Later in the day, the House Armed Services Committee approved a similar measure along party lines, 34 to 28. The full House must also vote on that measure. Although some of the president-elect\u2019s other Cabinet picks have come under intense questioning in their own confirmation hearings, Mattis encountered virtually no challenges from lawmakers to his suitability for the top Pentagon job. The 66-year-old veteran, known for his use of the call sign \u201cChaos\u201d during overseas deployments, has earned a reputation as a scholarly, plain-spoken officer with an impressive combat record. His blunt style has brought controversy at times, as have his hawkish views on confronting threats in the Middle East. How long Cabinet confirmations take \u2014 and why past nominees failed View Graphic How long Cabinet confirmations take \u2014 and why past nominees failed Mattis was named the head of U.S. Central Command in 2010, but he left in 2013 amid disagreement with the Obama White House over the general\u2019s desire to intensify the military response to Iranian activities throughout the region. Iran remains \u201cthe primary source of turmoil\u201d in the Middle East, Mattis told lawmakers on Thursday, with its support for regional militant cells, its ballistic missile capability, its maritime provocations and cyber initiatives. Although Mattis\u2019s hawkish views on the danger from Iran appear to coincide with Trump\u2019s, he broke with the president-elect by voicing support for leaving the nuclear deal with Tehran intact. \u201cI think it is in an imperfect arms control agreement \u2014 it\u2019s not a friendship treaty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.\u201d [ As a general, Mattis urged action against Iran. As a defense secretary, he may be a voice of caution. ] The questioning was notable for its scant discussion of the wars in Afghanistan, where 8,400 U.S. troops are stationed; in Iraq, where about 6,000 Americans are supporting a punishing Iraqi offensive against the Islamic State; and in Syria, where a small Special Operations force hopes to help local forces drive the militants from their stronghold of Raqqa. Mattis did say that the U.S. strategy for Raqqa \u201cneeds to be reviewed and perhaps energized on a more aggressive timeline.\u201d Speaking to lawmakers about Russian activity beyond its borders, Mattis gave a full-throated defense of NATO and said he supports the Pentagon\u2019s European Reassurance Initiative, which has added military power in eastern Europe in response to concerns about Russian pressure on the Baltics. On Thursday, Putin\u2019s spokesman criticized the United States\u2019 decision to begin a major deployment of troops and heavy equipment near Russian borders in eastern Europe. \u201cSince Yalta, we have a long list of times we\u2019ve tried to engage positively with Russia. We have a relatively short list of successes in that regard,\u201d Mattis said, referring to the Yalta conference at the close of World War II. \u201cThe most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with Mr. Putin and we recognize that he is trying to break the North Atlantic alliance, and that we take the steps . . . to defend ourselves where we must.\u201d As he did with Iran, Mattis, despite his harsh rhetoric, provided few specific ideas for using military means to push back against Russia. It\u2019s unclear whether Mattis\u2019s views will spark a confrontation with the Trump White House. Trump\u2019s apparent interest in partnering with Moscow against the Islamic State in Syria, for example, may renew resistance that such ideas have provoked among military leaders in the past. Mattis repeatedly spoke up for traditional alliances, including those with NATO, South Korea and Japan, that Trump has questioned. The president-elect has expressed skepticism about U.S. security commitments unless those partners increase outlays for their own defense. \u201cWe must also embrace our international alliances and security partnerships. History is clear: Nations with strong allies thrive and those without them wither,\u201d Mattis said. The nominee said Trump has shown himself to be open and inquisitive while discussing NATO with him. Asked how he, a retired four-star general, would negotiate his relationship with Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, retired three-star general Michael Flynn, Mattis said that debate of policy issues \u201cisn\u2019t always tidy\u201d but he didn\u2019t expect problems. Asked about the possibility that Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees may differ with him on Russia, incoming press secretary Sean Spicer said that the president-elect was \u201cnot asking for clones\u201d in selecting his senior advisers. Still, he said, \u201cat the end of the day, each one of them is going to pursue a Trump agenda and a Trump vision.\u201d [ With Trump as commander in chief, \u2018America is in uncharted territory\u2019 ] Democratic lawmakers expressed hope that Mattis, forged by the military establishment and boasting experience across administrations of both parties, would act as a restraint on some of Trump\u2019s impulses. Repeatedly, the retired general referred to the need to improve military readiness, blaming years of budget cuts for an erosion to American technology and manpower. Trump has promised to increase defense spending. Mattis, who comes from a service that has led pushback to efforts to integrate women into combat positions, also signaled openness to allowing female service members to serve in all jobs as long as they meet established requirements. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a strong supporter of gender integration, pointed to comments Mattis made after his retirement questioning the wisdom of placing women serving in all combat roles. Mattis responded that he has no plans to oppose women in any roles within the military. He said that he had hundreds of women serving among his 23,000 Marines during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \u201cI\u2019m coming in with the [understanding] that I lead the Department of Defense and if someone brings me a problem then I\u2019ll look at it, but I\u2019m not coming in looking for problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a way to get the department so it\u2019s at the most lethal stance.\u201d Anne Gearan, Karoun Demirjian, Joby Warrick, Kelsey Snell and Ed O\u2019Keefe contributed to this report.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced the review in response \u201cto requests from numerous Chairmen and Ranking Members of Congressional oversight committees, various organizations, and members of the public.\u201d The probe will also examine allegations that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe should have been recused from the probe. Questions were raised about McCabe\u2019s impartiality after it was revealed Clinton ally and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s donated to his wife\u2019s 2015 Senate campaign. Additionally, the probe will investigate allegations that DOJ and FBI employees improperly disclosed information not meant for the public.\u00a0This apparently refers to assistant attorney general Peter Kadzik, whose email tipping off Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta about a House oversight committee hearing was revealed by WikiLeaks. The review will also probe decisions regarding the timing of the FBI\u2019s release of certain Freedom of Information Act documents at the end of October. The FBI\u2019s Records Vault released a number of documents on Oct. 30 and Nov. 1, including the investigation into retired Gen. David Petraeus for compromising classified material, and the probe into President Bill Clinton\u2019s controversial 2001 pardon of financier Marc Rich. The timing led some to believe it was an attempt to influence the election. \u201cThe review will not substitute the OIG\u2019s judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions,\u201d the release from IG said.

    "text": "Ben Carson and Sen. Elizabeth Warren Spar on Trump Question at Confirmation Hearing By Katherine Faulders Jan 12, 2017, 1:33 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Ben Carson and Sen. Elizabeth Warren Spar on Trump Question at Confirmation Hearing 0 Shares Email Dr. Ben Carson today declined to say directly whether he can assure Americans that the Trump family would not benefit in any way from HUD incentives if he is confirmed as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cIt will not be my intention to do anything to benefit any American particularly,\u201d he said in response to pointed questioning from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate committee holding his confirmation hearing today. \u201cIt\u2019s for all Americans, everything that we do.\u201d Warren responded, \u201cI understand that. Do I take that to mean that you may manage programs that will significantly benefit the president-elect?\u201c referring to Donald Trump\u2019s vast real estate holdings, which include a minor stake in a sprawling affordable housing development in Brooklyn, New York. \u201cYou can take it to mean that I will manage things that will benefit the American people. That is going to be the goal,\u201d Carson said. \u201cIf there happens to be an extraordinarily good program that is working for millions of people and it turns out that someone that you\u2019re targeting is going to gain $10 from it, am I going to say, \u2018No, the rest of you Americans can\u2019t have it\u2019? I think logic and common sense will probably be the best way.\u201d The former Republican presidential candidate and retired neurosurgeon today cited his childhood of \u201chousing insecurity\u201d during remarks on Capitol Hill , where he faced the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs for the nomination hearing. Carson, who often spoke on the campaign trail about growing up with an illiterate single mother in Detroit, referred to her in his opening statement amid some concerns about his qualifications to run the agency and commitment to its survival. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any skills, basically a third-grade education, and we had no place to live,\u201d he said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t afford the house, so we ended up moving to Boston, moving in with relatives. So I have actually in my life understood what housing insecurity was. And we were there in Boston for a couple of years.\u201d Carson later pledged to undertake a \u201clistening tour\u201d across the country to better understand the issues he would face as HUD secretary. Donald Trump Picks Ben Carson for HUD Secretary In response to a question from one senator about whether he would \u201cadvocate for a HUD budget,\u201d Carson said he would push for funding the agency, adding that he would also put together \u201ca world-class plan on housing\u201d that he hopes lawmakers would support. He addressed a question from Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., who cited acute homelessness among veterans in his state and asked how Carson would help that community. \u201cWell, you know, people who go out and risk life and limb for us are people that should never want for any basic thing,\u201d Carson responded. \u201cWe should be willing to do it. The VASH program \u2014 Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program \u2014 has been very successful in reducing homelessness, but we still have a lot more to go. \u201cAnd I think this is another area where we must take a holistic viewpoint, and what I have advocated is when a person joins the military, they be associated with a support group at that time.\u201d He said he envisions that such groups would follow vets through their entire military career, especially during combat, and after they are discharged. \u201cThat way you discover early on what problems occur,\u201d Carson said, \u201cand are able to intervene at that point, which is considerably cheaper than waiting until we see the results of post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d Carson later told another senator he would protect the LGBT community from discrimination, prompted by her question on the issue. In a Dec. 5 statement announcing his intention to nominate Carson, Trump said, \u201cBen Carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities. We have talked at length about my urban renewal agenda and our message of economic revival, very much including our inner cities.\u201d The president-elect added of Carson, who sits on Trump\u2019s transition team as a vice chairman, \u201cBen shares my optimism about the future of our country and is part of ensuring that this is a presidency representing all Americans.\u201d I am thrilled to nominate Dr. @RealBenCarson as our next Secretary of the US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development: https://t.co/zYGi8fGnL5 pic.twitter.com/1D9NXlHc2b \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2016 Carson, 65, said in that statement, \u201cI am honored to accept the opportunity to serve our country in the Trump administration. I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly by strengthening communities that are most in need. We have much work to do in enhancing every aspect of our nation and ensuring that our nation\u2019s housing needs are met.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) December 5, 2016 Carson has been holding mock hearings, comprehensive information sessions and meetings with members of Congress to get up to speed on the agency and the issues, according to those familiar with his preparations. Among those advising Carson have been former Florida Sen. Mel Martinez and Alphonso Jackson, the agency\u2019s secretary under President George W. Bush. Martinez told ABC News that Carson was \u201cvery much on top of the issues\u201d of housing policy and argued that his lack of government experience heading into the role is not a liability but an asset, calling it \u201cpurposeful.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a common element in a lot of this administration,\u201d he said. Republican consultant Gianno Caldwell told ABC News that there are questions surrounding Carson\u2019s qualifications for the post but added that Carson has been preparing for weeks. \u201cThey have been prepping for weeks and meeting with members of Congress on the Hill since he got nominated,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cThey are very excited. There are lot of folks that believe he\u2019s going to do a very good job, put together an excellent team. There are questions surrounding his qualifications, but he\u2019s been prepping for weeks.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Email In bad news for sushi lovers, scientists have confirmed that a tapeworm known to infect salmon from the Asian Pacific is also present in fish from U.S. waters. The parasite, known as the Japanese broad tapeworm, can grow up to 30 feet long in the human body, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people who become infected have no symptoms, the CDC says. But some suffer abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. Over time, the infection can also lead to deficiency in vitamin B12. On the brighter side, infection with the tapeworm appears to be uncommon: Only around 2,000 cases have been reported in humans -- mostly in northeastern Asia, according to Roman Kuchta, the lead researcher on the new report. The first known human case in North America was recorded in 2008, said Kuchta. He\u2019s based at the Czech Academy of Sciences, in the Czech Republic. Now his team has confirmed that the tapeworm is present in wild pink salmon from the Alaskan Pacific. The findings are published in the February issue of the CDC\u2019s journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The risk of contracting the tapeworm from your sushi is low -- but it exists, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. \u201cWhen you\u2019re eating uncooked fish -- or other raw foods, like unpasteurized milk -- there is some inherent risk,\u201d said Adalja, who\u2019s also a senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Center for Health Security. That risk is not limited to tapeworms, he noted. Foodborne pathogens include bacteria, viruses and other parasites. People who love their sushi and ceviche may not be moved to give it up. But, Adalja said, it\u2019s important to be aware that tapeworm infection is a possibility. \u201cSo if you do develop unusual symptoms that can\u2019t be explained, you could mention to your doctor that you eat raw fish,\u201d Adalja said. The infection is treatable with medication, he said. According to the CDC, two drugs, called praziquantel (Biltricide) and niclosamide (Niclocide), are the main ones used to kill the parasite. The new findings are based on an analysis of 64 wild salmon, from five different species, caught off the Alaskan coast. Samples of pink salmon were found to harbor Japanese broad tapeworm larvae. How worried should raw-salmon lovers be? According to Kuchta, the tapeworm infection is usually not \u201cdangerous,\u201d causing problems such as abdominal pain and diarrhea in about 20 percent of people infected. But, he said, in rare cases, \u201cmassive infection\u201d can cause an intestinal obstruction or gallbladder inflammation. Plus, a tapeworm that grows to its full \u201cadult\u201d length consumes a lot of vitamin B12 , said Dr. Patrick Okolo, chief of gastroenterology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \u201cThat can lead to a vitamin B12 deficiency, which has neurological consequences,\u201d Okolo said. Those consequences can include numbness, tingling, balance problems, and trouble with thinking and memory. Okolo agreed that any tapeworm risk from raw salmon would \u201cclearly be small.\u201d But, he said, doctors might want to consider the possibility of a tapeworm if a patient\u2019s vitamin B12 deficiency cannot be otherwise explained. Okolo also suggested a safety measure for people who make raw-fish dishes at home: Freeze the fish for a few days, which will kill any parasite. \u00a9 2017 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

USA TODAY Sports San Diego Chargers owner Dean Spanos reacts during a NFL football game against the Oakland Raiders at Qualcomm Stadium. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) Dean Spanos didn\u2019t want to move the Chargers to Los Angeles. He still doesn\u2019t, even after Thursday\u2019s announcement that the team is \u201cdetermined to fight for LA\u201d \u2013 a slightly awkward declaration of war for a market occupied the past year by the Rams and their owner, Stan Kroenke, who is set to become Spanos\u2019 landlord. When Spanos addressed his fellow NFL owners at the league meetings last month, his tone was helpless and his message amounted to: I\u2019m out of options in San Diego, the city the Chargers have called home for 56 years, so it\u2019s probably going to come to this. What we know about Chargers' move to Los Angeles But Spanos did have an option, even after voters crushed a stadium referendum in November and the team determined the San Diego mayor\u2019s Hail Mary alternative relied on highly uncertain public funding mechanisms. If Spanos is willing pay a $550 million relocation fee to become football\u2019s equivalent of the L.A. Clippers, playing in The House That Stan Built starting in 2019, why wouldn\u2019t he increase the $350 million the Chargers had pledged towards a proposed stadium in San Diego and figure out a business plan to make back the difference? Plenty of teams \u2013 the New York Jets and Giants, San Francisco 49ers, Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys, among others \u2013 have taken more debt on their balance sheet to get stadiums done through private financing. A new building means new revenue streams and an immediate spike in franchise value. San Diego is a different market than those others, of course. The Chargers could maybe get back $200 million of their $350 million pledge through personal seat licenses. But that still leaves relatively little coming out of Spanos\u2019 pocket. What amounts to a $300 million grant from the NFL would get the Chargers over halfway to the $1.2 billion price tag. Like most billionaires, Spanos could\u2019ve gotten a nine-figure loan at a low rate. Incremental revenue increases would cover any interest expenses. And there\u2019s revenue lost when you, say, play two seasons in the 30,000-seat StubHub Center while waiting for Kroenke\u2019s nearly $3 billion, privately financed palace to open in Inglewood. Congrats San Diego, you win by losing Chargers Just 43% of voters supported Measure C, which needed a two-thirds majority to pass a hotel tax hike in November. So, the Chargers saw no hope in Mayor Kevin Faulconer\u2019s new plan, which called for $375 million in public funding, in three chunks subject to approval by city and county voters and approval by a Democrat-controlled state Legislature (plus gubernatorial approval) if San Diego State University couldn\u2019t come up with its $100 million share. In essence, it seems the Chargers viewed this as a binary equation: Public money, they stay in San Diego. No public money, they go. And that stance was perplexing inside the NFL, given Spanos had made abundantly clear he didn\u2019t really want to relocate, much less under these terms. He\u2019d already burned political capital in his bid for a combined stadium project in Carson, Calif., with the Oakland Raiders, who are now full-steam ahead on moving to Las Vegas after Kroenke\u2019s project won over owners last January. Roger Goodell: Chargers 'did everything they could' to stay in San Diego Even if the NFL put another $100 million into the San Diego pot \u2013 in essence, reappropriating funds they\u2019d earmarked as an incentive toward\u00a0the Raiders building in Oakland \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything done without Spanos putting in more of his own money. And there would\u2019ve been grumblings from those same owners who took on debt to get their stadiums done. The Chargers made a splash Thursday: unveiling a new logo, changing the team\u2019s Twitter name, Spanos taking a flight to L.A. They already are a year behind the Rams in terms of winning over fans (and their entertainment dollars) in a city that isn\u2019t exactly a prime sports town. Coupled with Tuesday\u2019s deadline for exercising their option to join the Rams (even if the Raiders were unlikely to exercise theirs in response), the Chargers\u2019 urgency is understandable. Barring some stunning development, the fight for L.A. is on. Plenty of people in the league already are wondering if it\u2019ll be worth it for the Chargers, though. Maybe even Spanos himself. 10872 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.

Brown/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images The highly rated variety of medical marijuana known as  \"Blue Dream\" was displayed among other strains at a cannabis farmers market in Los Angeles in 2014. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images So far, more than half of all U.S. states have legalized marijuana for medical use, and eight (plus the District of Columbia) have legalized the drug for recreational use. Varieties of cannabis available today are more potent than ever and come in many forms, including oils and leaves that can be vaped and lots of edibles, from brownies and cookies to candies \u2014 even cannabis gummy bears . A report published Thursday by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine analyzed more than 10,000 studies to see what could conclusively be said about the health effects of all this marijuana. And despite the drug's increasing popularity \u2014 a recent survey suggests about 22 million American adults have used the drug in the last month \u2014 conclusive evidence about its positive and negative medical effects is hard to come by, the researchers say. According to the report, that's at least partly because the federal drug enforcement agency's designation of the drug as as Schedule I substance \u2014 having \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\" \u2014 entails so many restrictions that it has been difficult for researchers to do rigorous research on marijuana. Article continues after sponsorship We just need \"far more information,\" Dr. Marie McCormick , chair of the NAS committee and professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, tells Shots. Some of the highlights of her committee's 337-page report on marijuana include: Medical Benefits Pain relief Regarding chronic pain, there's evidence that patients who are treated with cannabis or cannabinoids \"are more likely to experience a significant reduction in pain symptoms,\" the researchers say. More particularly, for adults with muscle spasms related to multiple sclerosis, there is \"substantial evidence,\" they say, that short-term use of certain oral cannabinoids can improve symptoms. And for adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, \"there is conclusive evidence\" that certain oral cannabinoids are effective in preventing and treating those ailments. Health Risks Cancer There is no evidence that smoking marijuana increases the risk for cancers often associated with tobacco use, such as lung and head and neck cancers, the scientists report, adding that more research is needed to determine whether marijuana use is associated with heart attack and stroke. However, they say, \"some evidence suggests smoking marijuana may trigger a heart attack among individuals with diagnosed heart disease.\" There's also some evidence that smoking marijuana during pregnancy is linked to lower birth weight in the offspring. Asthma and other chronic respiratory problems Evidence suggests that smoking marijuana on a regular basis is associated with more frequent chronic bronchitis and worse respiratory symptoms, such as chronic cough, the scientists say. But they add that it's unclear whether the drug increases the risk of developing asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mental health problems While the report notes some research suggesting that using marijuana might increase risk of developing schizophrenia or other social anxiety disorders, the committee of scientists cautions that there may be other explanations for that link; it could simply be, for example, that people with with these mental health problems are more likely to smoke marijuana. Injury or death In terms of risk to life and limb, the NAS committee found that driving under the influence of cannabis \"increases the risk of being involved in a motor vehicle accident.\" The report also cited evidence that increasing numbers of young children may be accidentally ingesting marijuana products now, particularly in states where cannabis use is legal. Substance abuse disorders Some parents worry that their teens' use of cannabis can cause problems, and the report was mixed in its conclusions on that. The evidence that marijuana is a gateway drug to trying other drugs, including tobacco, \"is limited,\" the researchers say. But they found \"moderate evidence\" that there's a link between cannabis use and the development of substance dependence or abuse problems with alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. What's more, the evidence suggests that initiating marijuana use at a younger age, the researchers say, \"increases the likelihood of developing dependency, which can affect academic performance and social interactions.\" \"The adolescent brain is very sensitive to these kinds of substances,\" McCormick says. \"So they continue to use it \u2014 and may use it in increasing amounts \u2014 and are at risk for developing problematic cannabis use.\" Erik Altieri, who directs the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , says he thinks the legalization of marijuana by many states may actually reduce the problematic use of the drug by teens. \"That's because we are taking marijuana off of the street corner,\" he says, \"and out of the hands of drug dealers, who have nothing but incentive to sell to everyone and anyone.\" Legalizing the drug, he points out, puts it \"behind the counter of a regulated business that has to check for ID, answer to the government and has oversight.\" So far, states that have legalized recreational marijuana have not seen an increase in use among underage teens, Altieri says. \"By legalizing it and normalizing it,\" he says, \"it's become just another everyday thing that adults partake in \u2014 it doesn't have that same draw to it that it used to.\" Still, McCormick says, many health questions remain to be answered by better research. The increased legal availability of cannabis products in many states, and their increased potency, she says, makes that rigorous research more important than ever. ",

    "text": "Email Moscow, we have a problem. Web surfers expecting to tune into C-SPAN's online feed of debate in the House on Thursday instead saw images supplied by the Russian news site RT, which briefly interrupted programming on the network's website. Spokesman Howard Mortman said the website, www.c-span.org , was replaced by RT for about 10 minutes. The problem was likely a routing issue, since RT is one of the networks that C-SPAN regularly monitors, he said. The network is \"investigating and troubleshooting this occurrence,\" Mortman said. The network later said it doesn't believe it was hacked. The programming glitch came hours after a power outage interrupted a Senate confirmation hearing for Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., to head the CIA. The hearing reconvened in a different room. The Architect of the Capitol's office said a local power company \"de-energized\" a system that feeds power to the Hart Senate Office Building. The office said the power company, Pepco, quickly restored the lost power. The architect's office said it is examining the surge-breaker that was unexpectedly affected by the planned Pepco work. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., later said she found it curious that she had just begun criticizing a Republican bill she contended would damage the regulatory authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission when the RT programming broke in. She also was criticizing President-elect Donald Trump for choosing someone with deep ties to Wall Street to lead the SEC. \"Placed in the context of current events concerning cyberattacks and foreign interference in our elections, it is very important that C-SPAN provide a clear and concise explanation for the interruption of its online broadcast before we can reach any conclusions or establish the basis for additional inquiry,\" Waters said in a statement. 0 Shares ",

Now, his community is rallying around him and his family. KUSA Hockey net (Photo: Julio Cortez, AP) DENVER \u2014\u00a0Anyone who knows Tony Salazar knows he's a fighter. Now, the Colorado hockey family is once again rallying around the former Ralston Valley standout as he faces his biggest battle yet. On Sunday, Salazar, 18, suffered a heart attack in his first ever hockey game for Metro State University. He was airlifted to the hospital where doctors determined his heart was working at just 10 percent. The latest update from the family said it has risen to 35 percent, but Tony has been placed on the heart donor waiting list for a transplant. Salazar had recently been cleared to play hockey for the first time since last year's Colorado high school state semifinals.\u00a0 He suffered a knee-on-knee collision in that game which caused blood clots to form in his legs . Those clots eventually made their way to his lungs, creating a life-threatening condition. When that happened, hockey players, families and teams from across the state -- in addition to the greater Colorado community -- banned together to raise money for his recovery efforts. The same is happening this time. In addition to local youth players and their families, messages from the University of Buffalo women's ice hockey team, Vanderbilt University hockey club and Colorado State hockey team have appeared on \u00a0the latest GoFundMe page \u00a0for Salazar. As of Friday, close to $11,500 was raised, but there is still a need. \"The family and everyone who has been supporting him and us with prayers and good wishes cannot thank you enough. Please do not stop. Tony has a long road ahead of him with ups and downs, and we do not know what the final plan will be but he has taught us we will all face it with determination, prayers, tears and laughter,\" the family said in a statement to 9NEWS. \"Thank you to all that who and continue to donate to his GoFundMe Page. From Tony's family to all, we are blessed for all we have received from his PD family, his hockey family, friends [and the greater community].\" Salazar is taking online classes through Metro State University, and is working at the Wheat Ridge Police Department as a community service officer. It is his dream to one day be a police officer. 9109 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.

Veuer's Nick Cardona has the story. Buzz60 FBI Director James Comey. 2775 CONNECT TWEET 9 LINKEDIN 103 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The Justice Department's inspector general Thursday announced a wide-ranging review of the FBI's handling of its inquiry into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email use, exhuming a series of events that the Democratic presidential nominee claimed helped doom\u00a0her bid for the White House. Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said the review was prompted by requests from federal lawmakers and members of the public. The internal inquiry will examine whether the Justice Department and FBI followed established \"policies and procedures'' when FBI Director James Comey publicly announced in July that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton related to her use of a private email server while at the State Department. The recommendation was quickly accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who had effectively ceded control of the inquiry to the FBI director after she met briefly with former president Bill Clinton prior to the conclusion of the investigation. Read more: 'Extremely careless,' but FBI advises no charges for Clinton's emails Horowitz also will review the explosive series of events in the days immediately before the November general election when Comey announced Oct. 28 that the bureau was reopening the inquiry after a new cache of emails was discovered during a separate federal review that targeted former Rep. Anthony Weiner, the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner has been the subject of an investigation into alleged sexually charged communications with a young girl. The re-opened inquiry was closed Nov. 6--just two days before Election Day\u2014\u00a0but Clinton has blamed the episode as contributing to her election loss to President-elect Donald Trump. The FBI director's action in October went against long-established Justice and FBI protocol not to take action in close proximity to an election that could influence the vote. Comey's late October decision also went against the counsel of the attorney general. \"The review will not substitute the (inspector general's) judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department (of Justice) regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions,'' the inspector general said in a written statement. \"Finally, if circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.'' Horowitz also is expected to review whether Justice or FBI personnel \"improperly disclosed non-public information'' during the series of the events that included the late October disclosure of the re-opened Clinton inquiry. The FBI didn't immediately comment on the review. Immediately after notifying Congress that he was re-opening the Clinton probe, Comey became the target of\u00a0withering criticism for departing from long-standing Justice Department policy against\u00a0taking politically charged actions in close proximity to an\u00a0election. Among the sharpest rebukes came from former Attorney General\u00a0Eric Holder, who was among nearly 100 former Justice officials who expressed their objections in a letter soon after the action. \"I support the inspector general's review of what happened at the DOJ and FBI during the Clinton investigation,'' said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Read more: Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "The U.S. border with Mexico is experiencing a new wave of crossings -- but intead of migrants coming from Central America or Mexico, this wave fe... The policy change will not result in the immediate deportations of Cubans already in the U.S. The policy applies going forward to those who arrive in the U.S. illegally by land or sea. Cubans will be treated like any other migrants and will still be able to apply for asylum based on their individual cases. The\u00a0 Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program will continue. The Coast Guard will continue to interdict migrants at sea.\u00a0 Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, acknowledged that the White House had previously denied it would adopt the policy, but said today that this was in part due to the fact that the U.S. did not want to encourage more Cubans to flee. He said that the majority of those fleeing Cuba in recent years are doing so for \u201ceconomic opportunity\u201d and not due to political persecution. Asylum is still available for those who have legitimate claims of persecution. The policy change is something Cuba has wanted for decades and is part of Mr. Obama\u2019s normalization of relations. Despite the change, however, the framework for \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d - the Cuban Adjustment act - remains in place. The White House is calling on Congress to repeal it. The new agreement does not change the existing 1994/1995 accord with Cuba stipulating that the U.S. will accept 20,000 Cubans per year. Those are people who would come to the U.S. through authorized procedures. The Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), an advocacy organization in Washington, D.C. that works to advance human rights in the Americas, said it supports the change in policy. \u201cThe Obama Administration has taken a positive step toward a more sensible Cuban immigration policy, one that ends preferential treatment for Cubans compared with others who arrive without visas,\u201d WOLA Program Director Geoff Thale said in a statement on Thursday. Thale said, \u201cWOLA and many colleagues have recommended to the Administration that it should both end preferential treatment for Cubans and increase the number of visas available to Cubans who pursue regular immigration routes.\u201d \u00a0 The U.S. and Cuba released a joint statement late Thursday confirming the change in policy. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy was put in place in 1995 by President Bill Clinton as a revision of a more liberal immigration policy. Until then, Cubans caught at sea trying to make their way to the United States were allowed into the country and were able to become legal residents after a year. The U.S. was reluctant to send people back to the communist island then run by Fidel Castro , and the Cuban government also generally refused to accept repatriated citizens. The Cuban government has in the past complained bitterly about the special immigration privileges, saying they encourage Cubans to risk dangerous escape trips and drain the country of professionals. But it has also served as a release valve for the single-party state, allowing the most dissatisfied Cubans to seek better lives outside and become sources of financial support for relatives on the island. The changes would be the latest step by Obama to normalize relations with Cuba.\u00a0 Relations between the United States and Cuba were stuck in a Cold War freeze for decades, but Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro established full diplomatic ties and opened embassies in their capitals in 2015. Obama visited Havana last March. U.S. and Cuban officials were meeting Thursday in Washington to coordinate efforts to fight human trafficking. A decades-old U.S. economic embargo, though, remains in place as does the Cuban Adjustment Act which lets Cubans become permanent residents a year after legally arriving in the U.S. The official said that in recent years, most people fleeing the island have done so for economic reasons or to take advantage of the benefits they know they can receive if they make it to the U.S. The official also cited an uptick in Cuban migration, particularly across the U.S.-Mexico border - an increase the official said reflected an expectation among Cubans that the Obama administration would soon move to end their special immigration status. Since October 2012, more than 118,000 Cubans have presented themselves at ports of entry along the border, according to statistics published by the Homeland Security Department. During the 2016 budget year, which ended in September, a five-year high of more than 41,500 people came through the southern border. An additional 7,000 people arrived between October and November.\u00a0 The influx has created burdens on other countries in the region that must contend with Cubans who have yet to reach the U.S. border, the official said. The Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, which was started by President George W. Bush in 2006, is also being rescinded. The measure allowed Cuban doctors, nurses and other medical professionals to seek parole in the U.S. while on assignments abroad. People already in the pipeline under both \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d and the medical parole program will be able to continue the process toward getting legal status. The preferential treatment for Cubans reflected the political power of Cuban-Americans, especially in Florida, a critical state in presidential elections. That has been shifting in recent years. Older Cubans, particularly those who fled Castro\u2019s regime, tend to reject Obama\u2019s diplomatic overtures to Cuba. Younger Cuban-American voters have proven less likely than their parents and grandparents to define their politics by U.S.-Cuba relations. Exit polls show President Barack Obama managed roughly a split in the Florida Cuban vote in 2012, and Trump in November won the same group by a much narrower margin than many previous Republican nominees.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

Desert Sun Published 6:33 p.m. ET Jan. 12, 2017 | Updated 14 hours ago Gun TV, based in Thousand Palms, Calif., had planned to launch in January 2016, but that turned out to be uncomfortably close to December 2015's mass killing in San Bernardino, so it delayed airing until April 2016. (Photo: Gun TV) THOUSAND PALMS, Calif. \u2014\u00a0Gun TV, a first-of-its-kind home shopping network abruptly stopped broadcasting and has halted sales less than a year after it launched. Gun TV was the brainchild of\u00a0Valerie Castle and Doug Bornstein of Rancho Mirage, Calif., veterans of the home shopping industry. The channel, billed as an iTunes for guns, also sold ammo, holsters and firearm accessories on Verizon Fios and dozens of other smaller cable television operators. Castle said in e-mail that Gun TV was \"pulling back on operations\" while it looks at distribution options.\u00a0Television broadcasts stopped earlier this week; all of the website's pages go to this message:\u00a0\u201cGun TV is presently off the air and is not currently accepting new orders.\u201d \"This is a simple business decision. We are confident we will be broadcasting again soon,\" she said. Want to buy a gun on your couch at 3 a.m.? Now you can Despite the shutdown, Castle said Gun TV is not leaving its studio in Thousand Palms, about 10 miles east of Palm Springs. Even so, film officials in the area already have begun looking to re-purpose the studio under expectations that the failed shopping network will move out eventually. The channel broadcast from a 7,500-square-foot studio formerly known as the Palm Springs Film Factory, said Levi Vincent, executive director of the Greater Palm Springs Film Alliance Office that assists film production companies in the desert. The studio has the potential to be used for television and movie\u00a0production, and local film students could use it, too. \"My ultimate goal is to save the studio, to keep the studio intact and an operating facility,\" Vincent said. GunTV shopping channel to start its shows in January The closure of Gun TV is not surprising, considering the fledgling home shopping network had been troubled since before aired. Gun TV was envisioned as a 24-hour channel\u00a0but launched with six hours of programming from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. PT. The channel also faced a lukewarm welcome in a nation where gun-law reform advocates argue people\u00a0already have too many guns, not too few. One late-night talk-show host, Samantha Bee, teased the channel for being \"dedicated to gun fondling.\" In response, Gun TV promised to focus on safety. First, the channel dubbed itself a production of The Social Responsibility Network, which calls itself the social messaging arm of Gun TV on\u00a0 LinkedIn \u00a0and has a\u00a0 one-page website \u00a0with a 70-word mission statement. It has no Facebook or Twitter presence though Gun TV does have a\u00a0 Facebook page , last updated Jan. 1 with a new year's message. 'Shark Tank's' Greiner: How to get on QVC Secondly, Gun TV pledged that 3 minutes of every hour would be dedicated to firearm education and safety training. In November 2015, The Desert Sun reported that Gun TV was locating in the Coachella Valley and planned to start broadcasting the following January. However, about two weeks later, 14 people were killed in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, about 60 miles away. After the massacre, many criticized the channel as tone deaf and ill timed.

By Greg Jaffe January 12 at 6:10 PM Follow @GregJaffe President Obama awarded the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to a shocked Vice President Biden on Thursday at the White House. Biden and the president had gathered with others for what the White House had described as a final tribute to the vice president. [ The Obama-Biden bond is among the strongest in White House history ] The event began with a playful and heartfelt tribute from Obama to one of his closest friends and confidants in Washington. As he finished his remarks, the president asked one of his military aides to come to the stage. \u201cFor the final time as president I am pleased to award our nation\u2019s highest civilian honor . . .\u201d Obama began as a Marine officer bearing the medal stood by. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Biden immediately spun around, turning his back to the crowd, and wiped his face and eyes with his handkerchief. The president bestowed the medal \u201cwith distinction,\u201d an additional level of veneration that his three immediate predecessors had reserved for only three others \u2014 Pope John Paul II, former president Ronald Reagan and Gen. Colin Powell. \u201cI had no inkling,\u201d Biden said after the medal was draped around his neck. \u201cI thought we were going . . . to toast one another and say what an incredible journey it has been.\u201d In his remarks, Biden praised Obama for serving the nation with dignity and insisted that he was not worthy of the honor. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve this,\u201d the vice president said repeatedly. Obama described Biden as a \u201clion of American history\u201d and praised his long service in the Senate. As vice president, Biden\u2019s influence has spanned both domestic and international policy initiatives. He was a critical voice in crafting strategy in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and in encouraging Obama to send Navy SEALs on a mission to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in 2011. Biden also helped oversee the president\u2019s first-term economic stimulus package and pressed unsuccessfully for gun-control legislation after the killing of 20\u00a0children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. (Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post) Obama embraced a common Biden tactic in his remarks by including a quote from an Irish poet and words of wisdom from the vice president\u2019s parents. The president also spoke of their friendship forged through tough times and tragedy. In 2015, Beau Biden, the vice president\u2019s son, died of brain cancer, and Obama delivered the eulogy at his funeral. Biden\u2019s first wife and daughter were killed in a 1972 car crash shortly after he was first elected to the Senate. That tragedy has been a key feature of Biden\u2019s political identity, and much of Obama\u2019s remarks focused on the vice president\u2019s compassion for his fellow Americans. \u201cWhen Joe talks about hope and opportunity for our children, we hear the father who rode the rails home there every night so he could be there to tuck his kids into bed,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen Joe talks to Gold Star families who have lost a hero, we hear a kindred spirit, another father of an American veteran, somebody whose faith has been tested and has been forced to wander through the darkness himself and who knows who to lean on to find the light.\u201d Biden recounted that Obama offered help when Biden\u2019s son was battling cancer and the vice president was weighing whether to sell his house to cover the bills. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the money,\u201d Biden recalled Obama telling him. \u201cPromise me. Promise me you won\u2019t sell that house.\u201d Biden said that he and Obama had on occasion differed on matters of policy but that he had never doubted Obama\u2019s judgment. \u201cI just hope that the asterisk in history that is attached to my name when they talk about this presidency is that I can say I was part of the journey of a remarkable man who did remarkable things for this country,\u201d Biden said. Biden closed by grabbing the medal, which had been draped around his neck, and lifting it off his chest. \u201cThis honor is not only well beyond what I deserve but it is a reflection of the extent and generosity of your spirit,\u201d he said, turning to the president. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve this, but I know it came from the president\u2019s heart.\u201d ",

Seth Wenig/AP hide caption toggle caption Seth Wenig/AP President-elect Donald Trump speaks as one of his attorneys listens during a news conference Wednesday at Trump Tower in New York. Seth Wenig/AP Among the unusual elements of President-elect Donald Trump's Wednesday news conference was a 15-minute interlude in which an attorney took the podium and described Trump's plan to address potential conflicts of interest between his businesses and the responsibilities of his office. Donald Trump's Press Conference, Annotated The attorney, Sheri Dillon, outlined an arrangement by which Trump would turn over \"total control\" of his worldwide business interests to his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, with whom he would not communicate about the family business. Dillon said real divestiture \u2014 selling the business or committing its assets to a blind trust \u2014 would be forcing him \"to destroy his business.\" She said the president-elect \"should not be expected to destroy the company he built.\" Gov. Nelson Rockefeller is shown in this undated photo. AP hide caption toggle caption Gov. Nelson Rockefeller is shown in this undated photo. AP Dillon went on to say that Trump's empire \"is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president, but at that time no one was so concerned.\" [Emphasis added.] It may have been the first time anyone has compared Trump's wealth to that of the Rockefellers, but that was not ultimately the point. It was the last eight words of her remark of that moment that raised eyebrows, because Rockefeller's wealth at the time was very much a concern to quite a number of people. Dillon might not be expected to have any personal recollection of the Rockefeller confirmation process more than 40 years ago, but the record is widely available. Rockefeller was picked to be the new vice president in September 1974, just weeks after President Gerald R. Ford was sworn in to succeed President Richard Nixon, who had resigned. Rockefeller, known as \"Rocky,\" had been elected the Republican governor of New York four times and had run for president three times. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Dismisses Russian Connection Allegations As 'Fake News' He was also a grandson of the legendary John D. Rockefeller, founder of the Standard Oil Co, and founder of perhaps the largest and certainly the most famous family fortune in America. The mid-1970s was a time of hypersensitivity to money issues in national politics, an era when ethics and campaign-finance reform were front and center in Washington \u2014 partly because of the Watergate scandals that had driven Nixon from office. Trump Team's Meeting With Latino Leaders Gets Mixed Reviews Rockefeller's nomination was, in fact, the subject of extensive hearings that fall, not only in the Senate but in the House of Representatives as well. (The provisions of the 25th Amendment governing the presidential succession required a confirmation vote in both chambers of Congress.) Many conservatives saw Rockefeller as a liberal, especially on social issues, and did not fancy him a heartbeat from the presidency. Many Democrats saw his great wealth as a source of inevitable conflicts of interest. His confirmation was far from assured, especially after it was revealed he had used $2 million in personal or family funds to make gifts to senior aides, including Henry Kissinger (who had moved on to serve both Nixon and Ford in the White House and as secretary of state), as well as to finance the publication of a biography critical of a Democrat who had opposed his re-election as governor. Trump D.C. Hotel Contractors Say They're Owed Millions Additional controversy arose over deductions he took on his federal income tax return, leading to an eventual settlement with the IRS for more than $900,000. But Rockefeller disclosed his various assets and trust funds and placed all his assets in a blind trust \u2014 the kind of steps Trump has not been willing to take. And in a lame-duck session after that fall's election, Rockefeller was confirmed by both the House and Senate. He served as Ford's vice president but was not made part of the ticket when Ford sought a full term in his own right in 1976. Buffeted by opposition within the Republican Party, Ford dumped Rockefeller for Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas. The Ford-Dole ticket lost in 1976. Rockefeller retired from politics and died of a heart attack in 1979 at the age of 70. ",

    "text": "By Karen DeYoung January 12 at 8:01 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 The Obama administration, in one of its last foreign policy initiatives, on Thursday ended the special status accorded Cuban migrants who, upon reaching this country, were automatically allowed to stay. Cubans are still covered by the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, which grants them the right to immediate admission and permanent residence status after one year here. But that temporary \u201cparole\u201d status while awaiting a green card, a Cold War policy that allowed the admittance of hundreds of thousands of Cubans, will no longer be granted. Effective immediately, President Obama said in a statement, \u201cCuban nationals who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal . . . treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries.\u201d The change applies to Cubans attempting to enter the United States by land from Mexico or Canada, as well as those arriving by sea. It ends the \u201cwet-foot, dry-foot\u201d policy, adopted by the Bill Clinton administration in 1996 to stem the tide of seaborne migrants crossing the Florida Straits. That policy differentiated between those reaching U.S. soil \u2014 who were allowed to stay \u2014 and those intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard, who were returned to Cuba. (The Washington Post) Now, said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, whose department is in charge of U.S. borders, Cuban migrants will be treated the same as \u201ca Guatemalan migrant or a migrant from El Salvador,\u201d the vast majority of whom are turned away. Cubans, he said, \u201cwill be subject to deportation consistent with our laws and immigration priorities.\u201d A statement issued by the Cuban government called the agreement \u201can important step in the advance of bilateral relations\u201d that will guarantee \u201cregular, safe and orderly migration.\u201d Cuba has long complained about the special status for migrants, particularly the \u201cwet-foot, dry foot\u201d policy, which it said encouraged what in many cases have been unsafe departures by unseaworthy vessels, homemade rafts and inner tubes. As part of the accord announced in both capitals, Cuba agreed to allow any migrant who has been out of the country for up to four years to return. Previously, anyone who had been gone for more than two years was legally said to have \u201cemigrated.\u201d The White House described the new policy as a logical extension of the normalization of relations with Cuba that began in December 2014, when Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro announced they would end more than a half century of estrangement. Since then, U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations have been reestablished, and Obama has eased long-standing restrictions on commerce and trade, as well as travel by U.S. citizens to the island. The change comes as President-elect Donald Trump has indicated his unhappiness with increased ties with Cuba and has threatened to \u201cterminate\u201d the normalization. \u201cIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,\u201d Trump tweeted in late November, after the death of Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, the current president\u2019s brother. If he chose to do so after taking office, Trump could order the Department of Homeland Security to reinstitute the previous special treatment of Cubans arriving here. Lawmakers who have long been opposed to the new relationship with Cuba also expressed displeasure at the new policy. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement will only serve to tighten the noose the Castro regime continues to have around the neck of its own people,\u201d Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said in a statement . \u201cCongress was not consulted prior to this abrupt policy announcement with just nine days left in the administration,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cThe Obama administration seeks to pursue engagement with the Castro regime at the cost of ignoring the present state of torture and oppression, and its systematic curtailment of freedom.\u201d The Cuban government continues to arrest dissidents and restrict civil liberties, including political and press freedoms. At the same time, however, it has slowly eased the tight control of its communist system on the private economy and other sectors. Others, however, applauded the change. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who has long advocated rapprochement with Cuba, said in a statement that \u201cthis is a welcome step in reforming an illogical and discriminatory policy that contrasted starkly with the treatment of deserving refugees from other countries. Refugees from all countries should be treated the same way, and now they will be. That\u2019s the American way.\u201d Business groups also expressed pleasure. Engage Cuba, a coalition of private U.S. companies and organizations working to end the trade embargo against Cuba that is still in place, called it \u201ca logical, responsible, and important step towards further normalizing relations with Cuba.\u201d Benjamin Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said that the policy change was part of the normalization process and the liberalization of travel from Cuba, and that it also stemmed from the growing number of Cubans who, anticipating a possible change, have tried to travel here illegally since the end of 2014. The total number of Cuban parolees in the United States \u2014 those reaching here without visas by land or sea \u2014 was 4,890 in 2013, according to Customs and Border Protection. In 2016, the number was 53,416. According to the Coast Guard, 1,885 people traveling by sea have either arrived here or been intercepted \u2014 and sent back \u2014 in fiscal 2017, which began Oct. 1. Thousands of others have crossed from Mexico, where thousands more are believed to be en route. The new agreement also ends the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, adopted under the George W. Bush administration, which targeted Cuba\u2019s policy of sending medical professionals abroad for humanitarian aid by encouraging them to defect. The program granted U.S. embassies abroad to accept them for U.S. migration. Cubans can still avail themselves of the Cuban Adjustment Act if they can successfully enter the country by applying for political asylum. Asylum adjudications normally take several years, which would give them time, under the act, to apply for a green card. In announcing the new policies, the White House encouraged Congress to repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act. Read more: ",

    "text": "Jan 12 2017, 5:58 pm ET U.S. Agrees to Pay Billions to Marines Affected by Toxic Water by Associated Press advertisement WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration has agreed to provide disability benefits totaling more than $2 billion to veterans who had been exposed to contaminated drinking water while assigned to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The decision was quietly made public Thursday with a notice in the Federal Register, the government's official journal. Beginning in March, the cash payouts from the Department of Veterans Affairs may supplement VA health care already being provided to eligible veterans stationed at the Marine base for at least 30 days cumulative between Aug. 1, 1953, and Dec. 31, 1987. Veterans will have to submit evidence of their diagnosis and service information. Related: Donald Trump Picks David Shulkin, Current Obama Appointee, to Lead Veterans Affairs Outgoing VA Secretary Bob McDonald determined that there was \"sufficient scientific and medical evidence\" to establish a connection between exposure to the contaminated water and eight medical conditions for purposes of awarding disability compensation. The estimated taxpayer cost is $2.2 billion over a five-year period. The VA estimates that as many as 900,000 service members were potentially exposed to the tainted water. \"This is good news,\" said retired Marine Master Sgt. Jerry Ensminger, whose daughter Janey was born in 1976 while he was stationed at Lejeune. Janey died from leukemia at age 9. Ensminger now heads a veterans group, The Few, The Proud, The Forgotten, which advocates for those seeking disability compensation. \"This has been a hard, long slog,\" said Ensminger, who says the government must go further in covering additional diseases. \"This is not the end of the issue.\" The new rule covers active duty, Reserve and National Guard members who developed one of eight diseases: adult leukemia, aplastic anemia, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, liver cancer, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Parkinson's disease. Related: One-Third of Calls to VA Suicide Hotline Don't Get Answered: Ex-Director Documents uncovered by veterans groups over the years suggest Marine leaders were slow to respond when tests first found evidence of contaminated ground water at Camp Lejeune in the early 1980s. Some drinking water wells were closed in 1984 and 1985, after further testing confirmed contamination from leaking fuel tanks and an off-base dry cleaner. The Marine Corps has said the contamination was unintentional, occurring when federal law didn't limit toxins in drinking water. Spurred by Ensminger's case, Congress in 2012 passed a bill signed into law by President Barack Obama extending free VA medical care to affected veterans and their families. But veterans were not automatically provided disability aid or survivor benefits. The issue has prompted lawsuits by veterans organizations, which note that military personnel in Camp Lejeune housing \"drank, cooked and bathed\" in contaminated water for years. \"Expanded coverage is making progress, but we also need to know whether the government may be purposefully leaving people out,\" said Rick Weidman, executive director of Vietnam Veterans of America. Affected veterans who were stationed at Camp Lejeune may now submit applications for benefits, once the rule is officially published Friday. Roughly 1,400 disability claims related to Lejeune are already pending, and will be reviewed immediately, according to the VA. Associated Press ",

Gary Klein and Lindsey Thiry discuss the Los Angeles Rams hiring\u00a0Washington Redskins offensive coordinator Sean McVay as their new head coach. The Rams featured one of the youngest teams in the NFL last season. Now they have the youngest head coach in league history. On Thursday, the Rams hired 30-year-old Sean McVay, the Washington Redskins \u2019 offensive coordinator for the past three seasons.\u00a0 The Rams will formally introduce McVay in a news conference Friday at their training facility at Cal Lutheran in Thousand Oaks. \u201cThis is a great day as we welcome Sean McVay as our new head coach,\u201d Rams owner Stan Kroenke said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThe accomplishments and success that he has had in less than a decade in our league are impressive.\u00a0 \u201cWe are confident in his vision to make this team a consistent winner and we will all continue to work together to achieve our ultimate goal \u2014 bringing a Rams Super Bowl championship home to Los Angeles.\u201d McVay, who will turn 31 on Jan. 24, is about eight months younger than Lane Kiffin was when he was hired by the Oakland Raiders in 2007. McVay is essentially in the same age demographic as his players. Rams defensive end William Hayes , at 31, is older than McVay, who was hired to turn around a team that finished 4-12 this season while averaging an NFL-worst 262.7 yards and 14 points per game. McVay\u2019s most important task: developing quarterback Jared Goff , the No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft. The Rams have not had a winning season since 2003 and have not made the playoffs since 2004. Kevin Demoff, vice president of football operations, had said the Rams would not limit their search. They formally interviewed eight candidates before selecting McVay. \u201cI am incredibly honored by this opportunity and I want to start by thanking Mr. Kroenke and Kevin Demoff for their faith in me to lead the Los Angeles Rams as head coach,\u201d McVay said in a statement. \u201cCollectively, we are committed to building a championship-caliber team, and I\u2019m excited to start that process and make our fans proud.\u201d After McVay\u2019s hiring was announced, players reacted on social media.\u00a0 \u201cExcited for the future of this team. Let's do this thing!\u201d tweeted Goff, who met with McVay before he was hired. \u201cWelcome coach!!! Glad to have you here!!\u201d tweeted middle linebacker Alec Ogletree . McVay replaces Jeff Fish-er, who despite having a contract extension, was fired with three games left in his fifth season. General Manager Les Snead , who was involved in the search and interview process, is expected to be retained. Snead also received a contract extension before last season. McVay is bringing in veteran coach Wade Phillips as defensive coordinator. Phil-lips, 69, is a former NFL head coach and was Denver\u2019s defensive coordinator for the last two seasons, helping the Broncos win Super Bowl 50 last February. Phillips will oversee a unit that ranked ninth under former coordinator Gregg Wil-liams, now with the Cleveland Browns . ",

    "text": "Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Topspin As Jim Durkin was finishing up his speech accepting another term as House Republican leader on Wednesday, the Western Springs lawmaker made note that Mayor Rahm Emanuel was in attendance. Durkin thanked Emanuel for coming to the inaugural ceremony and noted that his own legislative role as well as that of being a private attorney allows him to spend a lot of time in Chicago. \u201cMy family and I and all our friends and, I presume, everybody here entertains in the city, the city of Chicago. It\u2019s an amazing, amazing town. It\u2019s the jewel by the lake and truly an international destination place,\u201d he told the audience at the University of Illinois at Springfield. But the niceties about the city ended there. \u201cI, like all of us here, are saddened, sickened and angry with the daily news reports of shootings and murders in the city of Chicago. This must come to an end,\u201d said Durkin, frequently pounding a lectern to accentuate his message. \u201cWe must take the streets back from those cowardly thugs who have destroyed neighborhoods and families. And this must be done with federal, state and local collaboration. We cannot go through another summer like we have witnessed in these past few years,\u201d he said. Durkin pledged to work with the Democratic majority in the legislature and with Emanuel to make streets safer and to ensure the safety of children following a year that saw more than 760 gun deaths in the city. \u201cWhile we have problems with our budget, no one should feel good about what is happening. We need to do more as a legislative body. Society needs to do more as well,\u201d Durkin said. \u201cSo, as I said, I will work with anyone to stop this. It\u2019s personal for so many members of this body. It\u2019s personal for people in this crowd. It\u2019s personal for everyone in the state of Illinois who believes that everyone has a right to grow up safe and to be able to pursue the American dream without danger,\u201d he said. Emanuel attended the House inauguration, a chamber presided over by Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan , who is the chief political nemesis of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. The governor and mayor, who at one point vacationed together, have publicly clashed in their roles. But Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins cautioned against reading into Emanuel\u2019s decision to opt for the House over the Senate, where mayoral ally Senate President John Cullerton runs the show. Collins said the mayor met with the Senate president while in Springfield. (Rick Pearson, John Byrne) \u00a0 What's on tap *Mayor\u00a0Emanuel will join transportation officials to announce the latest milestone in the Union Station Funding Agreement. *Gov. Rauner will be on Facebook Live at noon \u00a0answering submitted questions. *The Illinois General Assembly will meet. *State Treasurer Michael Frerichs will announce a report Thursday morning on unclaimed life insurance policies and introduce legislation to go along with it. \u00a0 What we're writing *Madigan re-elected speaker \u00a0for 17th time, lays out Democratic economic agenda. *The U.S. Department of Justice is set to announce results \u00a0of its probe of Chicago police Friday. *Officials: Death of aide to U.S. Rep Dan Lipinski and daughter of former state senator ruled a homicide . *Glitch in city worker health insurance leaves them without coverage \u00a0for now. *As parks chief reassures residents over golf plan, district presses ahead . *Park District to expand water quality testing \u00a0at Chicago beaches.\u00a0 \u00a0 * IRS to delay tax refunds \u00a0for millions of low-income families *Judge asked to rule on spending of Aaron Schock \u00a0campaign money. *Chicago veterans museum acquires \u00a0 Kurt Vonnegut art prints. So it goes. \u00a0 From the notebook *Madigan money: There was the usual pomp and circumstance during Wednesday\u2019s Illinois House inauguration. A bunch of Democratic lawmakers got up to nominate and second the nomination of Michael Madigan as speaker. Some Republicans did the same for Jim Durkin, the leader of the chamber\u2019s minority party. Before the vote, Democratic Rep. Stephanie Kifowit of Oswego rose to give a speech. The three-term lawmaker ripped the current situation at the Capitol, saying the impasse is an exercise in stubbornness and lamenting that Democrats only had one choice for speaker. She also said she\u2019s frustrated by backroom deals and called for true compromise and collaboration, not secret budget groups. It was odd, as Kifowit, a Marines veteran, easily won re-election in November with 63 percent of the vote. Republicans put her on their bossmadigan.com target list, but so are 17 other House Democrats. At any rate, state campaign finance records show that despite lamenting having only one Democratic choice as speaker, Kifowit has accepted more than $723,000 in campaign money from three Madigan-controlled funds. The bulk of it helped Kifowit win in 2012 when it was an open-seat contest under what was then a new legislative map. *Avoid a credit downgrade?\u00a0A key ratings agency warned Wednesday that the health of the state's credit rating depends on whether lawmakers and Gov. Bruce Rauner can reach a budget agreement soon, noting efforts to break the gridlock that emerged this week in the state Senate. \"Although the legislature did not take action during the \"lame duck\" session that ended with the installation of the new legislature today, the state Senate has put forth a series of bills that have the potential to lead to a compromise that will resolve the impasse,\u201d Fitch Ratings said in a report Wednesday. \u201cThese proposals, if they proceed through the full legislature and are signed by the governor, have the potential to stabilize the Illinois IDR and related ratings if they lead to a structurally balanced budget and reduce accumulated budget liabilities.\u201d But Fitch goes on to note a huge \u201chowever,\u201d noting that \u201cprevious signs of progress have not always come to fruition.\u201d The plans under development by Democratic Senate President John Cullerton and Republican leader Christine Radogno call for an income tax increase, a penny-per-ounce tax on sodas, more casinos and borrowing to pay down the backlog of bills. That would be in conjunction with a freeze on local property taxes and other ideas Rauner has sought such as term limits and changes to the state\u2019s workers compensation system. Fitch says it\u2019ll make a credit decision by the end of January, meaning lawmakers don\u2019t have much time to act to prevent a possible downgrade. (Monique Garcia) *Two former reporters go to CPS:\u00a0Two former Chicago Sun-Times staffers now work for Chicago Public Schools\u2019 oversight agency. Rosalind Rossi (a widely-known writer who has tackled the city\u2019s education beat) and Art Golab (a veteran data reporter) will lead what CPS Inspector General Nicholas Schuler\u2019s office is calling the Performance Analysis Section. The unit\u2019s job, the office said in a Wednesday press release, will be to \u201canalyze large amounts of data and produce reports and analyses\u201d for the school board, district officials and the public. Those reports \u201cwill use clear language, graphics and charts,\u201d as part of efforts to present its work. The move represents an interesting strategy by the inspector general, who has outlined a series of disputes between his office and CPS CEO Forrest Claypool\u2019s administration. Schuler said his work has been obstructed and duplicated by a better-funded arm of Claypool\u2019s office, and also asserted the district has stalled his investigation of possible ethics violations involving a top CPS lawyer by invoking attorney-client privilege.
