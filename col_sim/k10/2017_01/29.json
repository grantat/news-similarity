    "text": "<p>Aravinda Pillalamarri, of Bel Air, Maryland, speaks to CBS Baltimore station WJZ-TV in an interview broadcast on Jan. 27, 2017.</p> Close WJZ-TV BEL AIR, Md. -- A U.S. citizen was asked her immigration status while taking a walk in her neighborhood in Maryland. The Bel Air Police Department is owning up to its misstep and says it will learn from the incident, CBS Baltimore station WJZ-TV reports . \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this to happen in Bel Air. Walking while brown? He said, \u2018No, no, no, nothing like that,\u2019\u201d Bel Air resident Aravinda Pillalamarri said. Pillalamarri told WJZ-TV Bel Air police officers demanded her ID after a resident called her in as suspicious. \u201cI had just come out for a walk, so I didn\u2019t have my ID. And he said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you have ID? Are you here illegally?\u2019\u201d Pillalamarri said. Bel Air Police Chief Charles Moore said asking for her nationality is insensitive but not racial profiling. \u201cThey were trying to figure out why there was some hesitation to provide identification,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he asked if she was illegal.\u201d Pillalamarri is an American citizen. But promises from President Trump have ramped up sensitivity on the issue of undocumented immigration. \u201cPeople are uncertain - we don\u2019t know what to expect. So this is really, I think, a reflection of that uncertainty that people are feeling,\u201d says Dr. Zainab Chaudry with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR. Moore and Pillalamari, who shared her experience at a town hall meeting last month, are both seeing this as a chance for real change. \u201cThat\u2019s an education for me,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat\u2019s helped me out to see that, hey, not only do I have to get my officers trained, I have to get the dispatchers trained on how to react to some kind of situation like that in the future.\u201d \u201cSocial justice starts locally,\u201d Pillalamari said, \u201cand I\u2019m really proud that Bel Air is rising to that challenge.\u201d Moore, who\u2019s only been in his position for a year and a half, said he\u2019ll also be looking at strengthening the department\u2019s policies. Bel Air is also developing a citizen\u2019s advisory board to discuss similar issues. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport was the scene of confusion and questions as a dozen people were detained and some separated from family members, according to lawmakers and attorneys scrambling to get them released and struggling to interpret the new rules. Related: Trump Signs Order Suspending Admission of Syrian Refugees Two of the 12 are Iraqi refugees, and one of them \u2014 identified as Hameed Khalid Darweesh \u2014 was let go Saturday afternoon following his detention, said New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler. The second refugee was later released, NBC New York reported. \"I am very, very thankful to all the people who can support,\" Darweesh told reporters as he was surrounded by dozens of protesters carrying signs that read \"Refugees welcome\" and \"No ban, no wall.\" \"America is the greatest nation,\" Darweesh added. \"America is the greatest people in the world.\" Nadler said it was unclear why Darweesh was released while the other 11 remained held at the airport Saturday afternoon. They could be transferred to an immigration detention center in New Jersey to meet with immigration lawyers, Nadler added. \"This should not be happening in America,\" he told reporters. \"The executive order is a gross violation of our standards, our norms and the spirit of our Constitution.\" \"We will use every tool at our disposal to bring justice to America\" - NY Congresswoman Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez addressing JFK protest #muslimban pic.twitter.com/whmPWBz91C \u2014 Chris Brooks (@chactivist) January 28, 2017 A senior Trump administration official told reporters that the two Iraqi men, which included Darweesh, were getting waivers allowing them to stay in the United States. The men were mentioned in a New York Times report Saturday, and it was unclear whether the remaining people detained at Kennedy Airport would also receive such waivers. Human rights attorneys could not immediately say which additional affected countries \u2014 Syria, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen or Libya \u2014 the others at Kennedy Airport come from. Play ",

The Victoria Advocate reports that a convenience store clerk spotted smoke and flames billowing from the Islamic Center of Victoria at around 2 a.m. Saturday and called the fire department. Jeff Cowan, battalion chief for the city's fire department, says firefighters and police officers found the mosque completely consumed in flames when they arrived. The blaze was extinguished about four hours later. No injuries have been reported. A GoFundMe set up to help pay for repairs has already raised over $100,000 in less than 12 hours.\u00a0 Victoria Fire Marshal Tom Legler has asked for help from state and federal fire investigators to determine what caused the blaze. The Islamic Center's president, Shahid Hashmi, wouldn't speculate about whether it was arson, but he says the building was burglarized a week ago. The paper reports that in July 2013, a man admitted to painting \"H8,\" a computer shorthand for \"hate,\" on the outside of the building. The mosque has a congregation of 100 members. Victoria is about 115 miles southwest of Houston. Advertisement ",

Kidnapping Suspect 0 Shares Email A manhunt is underway in the Washington, D.C. area for a suspect who kidnapped a male Georgetown University student Thursday afternoon, forcing him into an SUV and driving him to ATMs and high-end stores in an attempt to withdraw money from his bank account and use his credit card, police said. According to a Metropolitan Police Department report obtained by ABC News, the victim told officers that at approximately 3:20 p.m. on Thursday on a residential street in the District's Georgetown neighborhood, the suspect \"asked him for money and after he hesitated to answer, [the suspect] grabbed him by the arm and pulled him into his car.\" The suspect then drove the victim to several ATM machines and two separate stores in the District of Columbia and Maryland in an attempt to get cash and purchase merchandise with his credit card, according to the police report. According to the victim, all transactions were declined. The suspect then fled the scene in an unknown direction, according to the police report. The suspect's vehicle is described as a light gray or silver SUV or crossover-style four-door of an unknown make or model. Police described the suspect as a white male in his late 30s to 40s, 5 feet 9 inches to 6 feet tall, with a medium build, dark-colored hair, dark-colored mustache, and a beard. He was last seen wearing a black suit, black shirt, gray neck tie, and black shoes. A surveillance video was released by police Friday of the suspect and the victim in one of the stores they allegedly visited, according to ABC affiliate WJLA. Georgetown University issued a statement Friday alerting students and staff of the incident, adding that the Georgetown Police Department \"is coordinating with Metropolitan Police Department to increase patrols in the area.\" \"It's very highly unusual for this area,\" Georgetown University student Austin Szabo told WJLA. \"It's very highly unusual for this area. You hear about a lot of burglaries, people stealing laptops from unlocked rooms, but never anything kidnapping with a guy in a suit involved. You hear about a lot of burglaries, people stealing laptops from unlocked rooms, but never anything kidnapping with a guy in a suit involved.\" And Princess Adentan, another student, told WJLA, \"It makes you think about your safety on-campus, or near campus for that matter.\" ABC News' Benjamin Stein and Chad Murray contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

In addition to the Park Ridge man, a resident of Oak Lawn also was possibly being detained, according to his son. They were believed to be among as many as 18 people held at O'Hare because of the order, according to lawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project. \"This is insulting.

    "text": "News Nation & World Trump order aimed at refugees from Muslim countries sparks confusion, outrage President Donald Trump's sweeping executive order to suspend refugee arrivals and impose tough controls on travellers from seven countries was met with protests at U.S. airports.\u00a0 Tribune news services Contact Reporter Confusion, worry and outrage grew Saturday as President Donald Trump's crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim country took effect. Airlines blocked people traveling to the United States, legal challenges were underway and doubts abounded about whether the order would make America safer. The immediate fallout from Trump's order meant that an untold number of foreign-born U.S. residents now traveling outside the U.S. could be stuck overseas for at least 90 days \u2014 despite holding permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas. And some foreign nationals who were allowed to board flights before the order was signed Friday were being detained at U.S. airports, told they were no longer welcome. Trump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. Included is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. Trump's order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, indefinitely blocking entry for anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. Read the story The directive did not do anything to prevent attacks from homegrown extremists who were already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. It also omitted Saudi Arabia, home to most of the Sept. 11 hijackers. As a candidate Trump pledged to temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the U.S., then said he would implement \"extreme vetting\" for people from countries with significant terror concerns. Trump told reporters Saturday the order is \"not a Muslim ban.\" \"It's working out very nicely,\" Trump said of the implementation of his order. \"We're going to have a very, very strict ban and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\" The order drew criticism from U.S. lawmakers and officials around the globe. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said while Trump is right to focus on border security, the order is \"too broad.\" \"If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\" Sasse said. \"Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\" In Tehran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran would stop issuing new visas to U.S. citizens in response to Trump's ban, but that anyone already with a visa to Iran wouldn't be turned away. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to Twitter Saturday afternoon to say that refugees were welcome in Canada, \"regardless of your faith.\" Two of the first people blocked from entering the United States were Iraqis with links to the U.S. military. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi were detained by immigration officials after landing at New York's Kennedy airport Friday night. Darweesh had worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he worked as a contract engineer. He was allowed into the U.S. Saturday afternoon, hours after his attorney petitioned a federal court to let the two men go. In their court filing, his lawyers said Alshawai's wife had worked for a U.S. security contractor in Iraq. Members of her family had been killed by insurgents because of their association with the U.S. military. The government can exempt foreign nationals from the ban if their entry is deemed in the national interest. But it was not immediately clear how that exemption might be applied. Diplomats from the seven countries singled out by Trump's order would still be allowed into the U.S. ",

The Afghan boy, who was orphaned by a Taliban bomb, was days away from boarding a plane to the United States. Credit Kemal Jufri for The New York Times BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Sardar Hussain refused to believe it. He had been orphaned in Afghanistan by a Taliban bomb at age 13. After waiting in limbo for two years, he said he was only days away from getting on a plane to the United States when he heard that President Trump would be barring entry to refugees. Mustafa did believe it. He teared up, saying his life was over at age 28. An Iraqi refugee in Lebanon, he thought he was so close to getting to the United States that he had gone out and bought a new shirt for his trip. When she read on Facebook about the temporary ban , Alwia Abdullah, 43, who fled from Darfur in Sudan to Jordan with her husband and six children, got a sudden, stabbing pain in her gut, and couldn\u2019t sleep. \u201cWe left because we were discriminated against in Darfur,\u201d she said. \u201cSo to be discriminated against by a U.S. president, by a nation we see our future in, is so disheartening. How do you live with that?\u201d Continue reading the main story They were among an estimated 110,000 people in line to be processed for resettlement in the United States during this fiscal year. In fact, they thought they had already made it through the rigorous vetting procedure and, after years of waiting, were on the verge of having their hopes realized. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now, all are suddenly, indefinitely waiting again, barred from entry to the United States for at least four months, according to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Friday, with no assurances of what could happen to them next. The order, Mr. Trump said, is a way to \u201ckeep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he said at the Pentagon. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.\u201d The executive order calls for the United States\u2019 annual refugee quota to be cut to a maximum of 50,000, compared with 85,000 allowed in during the fiscal year ending in September 2016.

If you have information, please contact us at immigration@nytimes.com . Email Us Even last year\u2019s figure was dwarfed by the historically high number of displaced people in the world, 65 million , or by the more than 1.5 million migrants and refugees arriving in European countries since 2014. Mr. Trump\u2019s order also suspends the entry of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, calling their arrival \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d Beyond that, it suspends visas to people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days. Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee ban, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesman, said he hoped \u201cit\u2019s a temporary one.\u201d He noted that more people were displaced around the world than ever before. \u201cThe U.S. resettlement program is one of the most important resettlement programs the U.N. works with,\u201d he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump\u2019s action was the latest closed door in a world that has become increasingly unwelcome to refugees, amid rising concerns and hostility in many resettlement countries in Europe, and in countries of first refuge like Turkey and Lebanon. For those refugees, in particular, who thought that their asylum process was over and that they would be accepted in the United States, the dismay was overwhelming this past week. Faten Diab, 34, a former charity worker from Syria, said she had been told that she and her family would be among a relatively small number of Syrians allowed into the United States. Last year, only 10,000 had been granted that privilege, compared with 40,000 in Canada . Ms. Diab and her husband said she fled to Turkey and applied for asylum in the United States in summer 2015, along with close friends who applied at the same time.

Now, that may never happen. Reached by telephone in their tiny apartment in Turkey, Ms. Diab sounded distraught, as the couple\u2019s 2-year-old daughter could be heard playing in the background.

You can say he is wrong. Because he didn\u2019t live the application steps in all its difficulties.\u201d Strictly speaking, America does not actually owe anything to the Diabs from Syria or the Abdullahs from Darfur; they are just reacting to its historical promise to take the world\u2019s \u201c huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d But in other countries, like Iraq, citizens who worked for the American military, government and companies were promised preferential treatment for resettlement. Many thought that the risks they took on behalf of the United States would be repaid one day with a safe haven when they needed it. Now Iraqis are also on Mr. Trump\u2019s proscribed list.

He is the secretary of Russia's Security Council . The telephone call between Putin and Trump expected to take place later Saturday will be the first official contact between the two leaders since Trump was sworn in as president.

Mr. Trump\u2019s assessment of cities is rooted in the problems of segregation, discrimination and economic inequality that \u201curban progressives\u201d have emphasized, argued Aaron Renn, a senior fellow in urban policy at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think tank. The president wants to correct those disparities, Mr. Renn said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him once say, \u2018You\u2019re to blame for the problem,\u2019\u201d he said.

A brown tote bag dangled from her wrist. Despite the high crime statistics in this part of town, she had little concern walking around here. \u201cWhy would it be scary when we know each other?\u201d she asked. That sense of community and kinship belies the rough edges on Frankford\u2019s surface, residents say. It is something that people would never see or appreciate if they judged the community only by crime and economic statistics, they said. It is a neighborhood of tightly packed rowhouses.

Ms. Davenport, 23, said she avoided certain parts of the neighborhood known for having a lot of riffraff. But having lived here for a decade, she said, she feels comfortable enough to let Lyric play outside. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids are friendly.

    "text": "Privacy Policy In the political realm, where emotions and symbols hold sway, Mr. Trump\u2019s order may reassure some Americans that they are safer from terrorism, and more generally, from concerns that Muslim immigrants may bring an alien culture. (While ostensibly addressing terrorism, it also says that the United States should be protected against those with \u201chostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles\u201d or those \u201cwho do not support the Constitution.\u201d) The trouble with such reassurance, even if it is effective, is that it comes at a high cost, in the view of many experts on terrorism. That cost will be counted not just domestically but also abroad, where the United States relies on allies, including Muslim countries, for intelligence and other help against terrorism. \u201cIn my opinion, this is just a huge mistake in terms of counterterrorism cooperation,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, formerly the State Department\u2019s top counterterrorism official and now a scholar at Dartmouth. \u201cFor the life of me, I don\u2019t see why we would want to alienate the Iraqis when they are the ground force against ISIS.\u201d At home as well, Mr. Benjamin said, the president\u2019s order is likely to prove counterproductive. The jihadist threat in the United States has turned out to be largely homegrown, he said, and the order will encourage precisely the resentments and anxieties on the part of Muslims that fuel, in rare cases, support for the ideology of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt sends an unmistakable message to the American Muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. That, he said, will \u201cfeed the jihadist narrative\u201d that the United States is at war with Islam, potentially encouraging a few more Muslims to plot violence. For an action aimed at terrorism, the order appeared to garner little or no support among experts and former officials of every political stripe with experience in the field. Jonathan Schanzer, vice president for research at the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that if the temporary visa ban was used to review and improve immigration vetting procedures, it might be justified. But he added that he knew of no obvious problems with those procedures, and no specific plans to address such issues over the 120-day ban. \u201cThe order appears to be based mainly on a campaign promise,\u201d he said. Mr. Schanzer said he was frustrated that during the Obama administration, there had been inadequate attention to the ultimate driver of refugee flows and jihadist terrorism in the United States and elsewhere. \u201cWe have several bloody, complex and interlocking conflicts in the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the job of the new administration to come up with policies that address those conflicts. Admittedly, that is not easy.\u201d Much easier, clearly, is issuing an executive order with political appeal and a title that seems to smack of common sense. But as the Trump administration is finding out, such pronouncements from an American president have many consequences, not all of them intended, anticipated or desired.

Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press hide caption toggle caption Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press Russ Girling, president and CEO of TransCanada Corporation, addresses the company's annual meeting in 2015 in Calgary, Alberta. Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press Just as President Trump takes power promising to ramp up oil and gas production, a sudden resignation in a key agency threatens to put such projects on hold across the United States. On Thursday, Norman Bay, one of just three current members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), said he would resign effective Feb. 3, even though his term isn't up until next year. His announcement came shortly after Trump decided Bay's fellow commissioner, Cheryl LaFleur, would serve as the Commission's new chair. \"I think [Bay] was perhaps disappointed that Commissioner LaFleur was elevated above him,\" says Carolyn Elefant, an energy lawyer who represents landowners negotiating with pipeline companies. After Bay's abrupt decision, Elefant says she's \"heard in some FERC circles he's being criticized for that.\" The resignation could mean costly delays for some major pipeline projects. The independent agency oversees the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas and oil. It's supposed to have five commissioners, but Bay's departure leaves FERC with just two \u2014 not enough for the required quorum to make decisions. Some projects that have been through years of regulatory review and were nearing the finish line could now be in limbo for months. Article continues after sponsorship That includes new multibillion dollar transmission pipelines intended to alleviate a glut of natural gas in the Appalachian basin. If approved, they will supply markets including the East Coast, Midwest, Gulf Coast and Canada. TransCanada Submits New Application To Build Keystone XL Pipeline It's unclear what impact the FERC delay might have on the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, which Mr. Trump aimed to green light through executive actions this past week. Williams Partners' Atlantic Sunrise pipeline is among those awaiting final word from FERC. The pipeline would ship gas from northeastern Pennsylvania southward and connect into a larger network of existing lines. \"The president clearly recognizes that natural gas infrastructure is critical to U.S. economic growth, job creation and expanding the American manufacturing base,\" says Williams spokesman Chris Stockton in an email. \"We believe this administration will prioritize filling the commission's vacancies so that critical natural gas infrastructure projects like Atlantic Sunrise can be approved.\" The project has faced intense criticism from local opponents, who recently built encampments and are working with activists who participated in the protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. On Friday the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, a trade group representing pipeline operators, sent Trump a letter urging him to act quickly to fill the vacancy. Dakota Access Pipeline Foes: We Aren't Done Fighting Yet \"The most significant barrier to building this infrastructure is often the permitting and approval process,\" wrote INGAA president Donald Santa. \"We must have a functioning FERC to move forward with building this critical energy infrastructure.\" Even if the president chooses someone quickly, the process will likely take several months \u2014 the appointment requires Senate confirmation. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, says she will make it a top priority. \"After next week, FERC will need a full complement of commissioners as soon as possible so that it can tackle the important work on its busy docket,\" Murkowski said in a statement. \"The senate's challenge will be to promptly consider, without undue delay, FERC nominations once they are received.\" In the meantime the agency's Acting Chairman Cheryl LaFleur says the next few days before Bay leaves will be busy ones. \"The commission is working to get as many orders out as we can in the time we have left with a quorum,\" she says. \"I am confident that, with the strong team we have here at the commission, we can continue to do our important work.\" This story is from StateImpact Pennsylvania , a collaboration between WITF and WHYY covering the fiscal and environmental impact of Pennsylvania's energy economy ",

An analysis of Ryan's \"Better Way\" plan by the nonpartisan Center for Health and Economy estimated 4 million fewer people would be insured by 2026 under the bill compared to the current law, mostly due to reductions in Medicaid spending (more on that later). Both Price and Ryan's proposals would weaken protections on consumers with pre-existing conditions, which could set up a situation where sick patients who can't keep up with their insurance payments find themselves unable to afford new coverage later. Some GOP plans seek to address this by funding high risk pools for these types of consumers, but those too would likely require a lot of additional money to be effective. All this is why many Republicans have been nervous about adopting Trump's \"insurance for everybody\" language, talking about providing \"access\" to affordable health care instead. But Trump's not the only one in the party to talk up expanding insurance beyond those who've purchased it under Obamacare. Price, in his confirmation hearings, also told senators he \"absolutely\" shared Trump's commitment to add to the insurance rolls: \"We still have 20 million individuals without coverage,\" he said. \"I think as policy makers, it is incumbent upon us to say, what can we do to increase that coverage?\" There is at least one Republican proposal Trump could adopt that is explicitly aimed at expanding coverage beyond Obamacare levels. GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan Collins of Maine have introduced a bill that would allow states to keep a version of Obamacare or opt into a plan that would automatically provide a new, stripped down insurance plan to everyone unless they decide to opt out or upgrade themselves. The trade-off is that these more affordable starter plans would be required to cover less than Obamacare, which has a detailed set of \"essential benefits\" every plan must include along with limits on certain costs. Keep this distinction in mind as we get into another Trump promise \u2026 What Does 'Much Lower Deductibles' Mean? Trump didn't just promise insurance for everyone. In the same Washington Post interview, he also promised \"much lower deductibles.\" One of the biggest complaints about Obamacare's individual insurance plans is that consumers have to meet high deductibles before they get reimbursed for expenses, although some preventive services are covered before then. But Republican plans don't purport to reduce deductibles, generally speaking, while the ACA sets some limits. The benefit to the GOP approach is that by allowing insurance companies to sell high-deductible plans that cover fewer services, insurance companies could reduce their premiums. But if they decide to instead to set a goal of reducing deductibles while also expanding coverage, insurance would become more expensive. That approach could also end up costing the government more than Obamacare does, by upping the subsidy needed to help people afford a plan. Tom Price (L), Trump's nominee to lead the Health and Human Services Department, alongside Republican Senator from Utah Orin Hatch (R), prepares to testify at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. LO SCALZO/EPA/REX/Shutterstock / Shutterstock Some Republicans are choosing to interpret Trump's \"lower deductible\" promise to mean he wants a plan that broadly addresses consumer concerns about out-of-pocket costs. They argue that tax-free health savings accounts, where consumers can store money to spend on health care expenses, can do the job. \"What you can do is pair those higher deductible plans with a subsidized health savings account and that can be used to help pay for the deductible,\" Collins told NBC News when asked about Trump's comments. While an HSA might be able to provide some benefits, it's still separate from what Trump brought up. That makes this promise something to watch as the debate moves forward. What Does it Mean Not to 'Cut' Medicaid? When it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, Trump's position sounds as clear as could be: No cuts. \"I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,\" Trump told The Daily Signal shortly before announcing his campaign. Price told senators at his confirmation hearing that he had \"no reason to believe that (Trump's) position has changed.\" Price also indicated that Medicare, the government-run healthcare plan for older Americans, would not be a part of their health care overhaul at all, despite longtime calls by Ryan and other GOP leaders to partially privatize it. When it comes to Medicaid, the government health care program for low-income people, the definition of \"cuts\" could be a source of contention. Trump and Republican lawmakers have separately proposed changing the way Medicaid, which helps states cover lower income residents, is organized. Right now, the federal government guarantees it will pay states for each individual who signs up for Medicaid. The ACA also provided money to expand Medicaid to people with higher incomes and gave states who decided to accept the funds some flexibility on how to use it. Trump and GOP leaders want to turn Medicaid spending into a block grant instead, which would give states a fixed amount of money at once and even more choices as to how they spend it. Some plans would also give states the option of taking a fixed per-capita amount for each person who participates. Play ",

    "text": "CBS/AP January 28, 2017, 2:07 PM Iraqi immigrant freed after being detained at New York airport in wake of Trump immigration action Email Last Updated Jan 28, 2017 5:00 PM EST An Iraqi immigrant was freed Saturday after being detained overnight at one of New York\u2019s airports in the wake of President Trump \u2019s latest executive action on immigration. Hameed Khalid Darweesh appeared outside John F. Kennedy International Airport Saturday afternoon with two members of Congress. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world,\u201d Darweesh told reporters. Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. He was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at Kennedy Airport Friday night.\u00a0 Lawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, and Jerrold Nalder, D-New York, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. Nadler and Velazquez appeared with Darweesh outside the airport. Iraqi immigrant Hameed Darweesh, center, walks out of Terminal 4 with U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez after being released at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, Jan. 28, 2017. Reuters/Andrew Kelly In an interview with CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton, Nadler said he was told by U.S. customs officials that a total of 12 people had been detained and one of the 12 was released. It was his understanding that all 11 were being held at JFK airport. Nadler said that number could grow as more planes land. Nadler said these are people with valid visas who were already on planes in the air when the executive order was signed. He said the executive order Mr. Trump signed on Friday \u201cis either pure stupidity or being done for public relations.\u201d He said it has had \u201csevere human consequences\u201d and has affected the reputation of the United States. Nadler said he was working to try to get the detainees freed and will try to bring pressure to have the executive order revoked. On Friday, Mr. Trump temporarily barred entry to the U.S. for all refugees and citizens of seven Muslim majority nations: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Senior administration officials told CBS News Saturday that for permanent American residents -- those holding green cards -- from the listed countries, their readmittance to the U.S. will be done on a \u201ccase by case exemption process.\u201d Customs and Border Protection was notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines were being told to keep them off those flights. In Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States\u2019 new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \u201cI am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\u201d said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. Others say they are not surprised at Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201cHis intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\u201d said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \u201cBut you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. The official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \u201ccounteraction\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201cIran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals,\u201d the statement says.\u00a0 \u201cIt will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions,\u201d the statement adds.\u00a0 In Cairo, airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York\u2019s JFK airport would return to Iraq. They said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Erbil, capital of Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region, Sunday morning. They added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. The officials said Saturday\u2019s action by the airport was the first since Mr. Trump signed Friday\u2019s order. The officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. Dutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States. Manel Vrijenhoek, at KLM\u2019s press office, said: \u201cWe would love to bring them there. That\u2019s not the problem. It\u2019s just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world - that these people are no longer welcome.\u201d She said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the ban. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

It was one of five calls with foreign leaders Trump had scheduled for the day. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on Saturday. It was one of five calls with foreign leaders Trump had scheduled for the day. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Updated at 5:00 p.m. ET It has been a day thick with phone calls for President Trump. By the end of the day, the president will have spoken over the phone with the leaders of five countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Administration officials have not yet announced the content of the 50-minute phone call with Putin, which Vice President Mike Pence also sat in on. But in a statement, the Kremlin says that \"both sides showed their readiness for active, joint work to stabilize and develop Russian-American cooperation,\" according to The Associated Press. The Kremlin says the two leaders will maintain \"regular personal contact,\" the news service reports. Trump also has scheduled calls Saturday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe It was Abe's call that opened the day, with a discussion focused primarily on the U.S.-Japan alliance. During the conversation, Trump \"affirmed the the ironclad U.S. commitment to ensuring the security of Japan,\" according to the White House, in what marks a departure from some of Trump's statements during the presidential campaign. Article continues after sponsorship During that campaign, Trump said specifically that he believes Japan does not sufficiently reimburse the U.S. for American military bases there. In the first presidential debate, Trump had suggested he would consider pulling those bases out of the country if Japan did not up its payments. \"We defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend South Korea. We defend Saudi Arabia. We defend countries,\" Trump said last September. \"They do not pay us what they should be paying us because we are providing a tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.\" That rhetoric left America's Asian allies uncertain about how his incoming administration would handle trade and security in the region, as NPR's Elise Hu reported last year. Japan And South Korea Rattled By Trump's Talk Of Closing U.S. Bases On Monday, Trump confirmed his disapproval of one tentative agreement with Japan, signing a memorandum to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal that would have comprised 12 Pacific Rim countries, including Japan. Despite that earlier move on the multilateral TPP, Trump and Abe also \"committed to deepen the bilateral trade and investment relationship\" on Saturday, according to the White House. Trump and Abe agreed to meet in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 10. German Chancellor Angela Merkel After his talk with Abe, Trump \"held an extensive telephone conversation\" with Merkel about a wide array of issues, the White House says. On the docket was NATO, the Middle East and North Africa, Russia and Ukraine, according to a statement from the office of Trump's press secretary. The statement continues: \"The President and Chancellor also agreed on the NATO Alliance's fundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community.\" As with the alliance with Japan, Trump has previously voiced skepticism of NATO , calling it \"obsolete\" in an interview earlier this month with the Times of London and Germany's Bild newspaper.

The order suspends entry for 90 days from certain nations based on statute related to the Visa Waiver Program. The most recent version of that program named Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. The order contains some visa exemptions. Related: Trump Travel Restrictions Leave Refugees Stranded: Reports \"We have strongly advised students and scholars who might be affected and who have travel plans in the coming days to defer travel outside of the United States until there is some clarity and legal analysis of the situation or, if they must travel, to seek legal counsel before they do,\" Princeton University said in an email. Stanford's Bechtel International Center listed in a Facebook post Friday the seven countries that could be affected and said \"we recommend that nationals of these countries do not travel.\" A Stanford PhD student flying into New York late Friday night from Sudan was detained for around five hours after Trump signed the order, university spokesperson Lisa Lapin said.

We are working closely with them to offer every support we can,\" the letter from Provost Martin A. Schmidt, Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart, and Vice President for Research Maria T. Zuber said. Trump signed the order as part of what he called an effort to prevent foreign terrorists from entering the U.S. It also barred entry by all refugees for 120 days, and suspended indefinitely admittance of Syrian refugees until the president is satisfied with changes made to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. The order allows some exemptions, and it is unclear how many students might be affected.

A new, publicly available archive aims to give scholars and dabblers alike a chance to decide for themselves. This image was rendered in 1795, more than a decade after George nearly abdicated. William Perther/Library of Congress King George III isn't exactly a hero of history. In most U.S. textbooks, he is portrayed as the British tyrant who lost the Colonies in the American Revolution. He's scarcely more popular in his native U.K., where his bouts with mental illness late in life earned him the impolite epithet \"Mad King.\" And lately, on stage in Hamilton, George's alleged villainy is played for laughs. But starting Saturday, the much-maligned monarch may get a second chance. In partnership with Queen Elizabeth II, the Royal Archives in the U.K. have launched the Georgian Papers Programme , a vast project to digitize hundreds of thousands of the king's papers. These documents, which are held both in the Royal Archives and the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, include letters to his wife Charlotte, essays, notes about the Revolution \u2014 even a handwritten draft of a statement of abdication he wrote in 1783. He wrote it, marked it up with revisions \u2014 but he never sent it. George went on to become the longest-ruling king in British history, his reign only ending with his death in 1820.

By 2020, he project aims to digitize more than 350,000 of George's documents, all of which will be freely available to scholars and historical dabblers alike. The BBC gives a hint of some of the documents historians have uncovered. \"One [of George's private agents], code-named Aristarchus, asked for payment for intelligence that France was plotting to assassinate the king \u2014 dubbed 'the mad king' \u2014 as he walked at night in the Queen's Garden. \"Another discovery was a blonde lock of the hair of Prince Alfred, who died when he was a baby, sewn into a letter from Charlotte \"Academics also uncovered a letter in which the king told Prime Minister Lord North how the Prince of Wales had an 'improper connection' with an actress who was blackmailing him.\" The online launch precedes a documentary, set to be broadcast in the U.K. on Monday, which depicts the early stages of the project, including the discovery of some of the papers discovered above.

CEO Sundar Pichai spoke out Friday night against President Trump's executive order to ban citizens of seven countries from entering the U.S. Google Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai spoke out Friday night against President Trump's executive order to ban citizens of seven countries from entering the U.S. (Chandan Khanna / AFP) Tracey Lien Contact Reporter The morning after Donald Trump won the presidential\u00a0election, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amr Shady called his immigration lawyer in a panic. \u201cMy 10-year-old daughter asked me, \u2018Does this mean we\u2019re going to get kicked out?\u2019\u201d said the 40-year-old\u00a0founder of analytics start-up Reveel, who  emigrated\u00a0 from\u00a0Egypt to the Bay Area\u00a0in 2015. \u201cI had to find out what Trump winning meant for my immigration status, but also what it meant for my chief data scientist.\u201d His lawyer, Los Angeles immigration attorney Ayda\u00a0Akalin, was inundated with calls from similarly nervous clients who were either already living and working in the U.S. on visas, or had visa applications pending.\u00a0 At the time, Akalin assured them that nothing had yet changed, and it was too soon to be worried. But after Trump signed an executive order\u00a0Friday banning citizens of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya from entering the U.S. for 90 days, Akalin had an update for her clients, particularly those from Muslim-majority countries: Stay inside the United States. \u201cAll of my Muslim clients are scared, even those from other countries,\u201d said Akalin, who herself is Iranian American, having immigrated to the U.S. when she was 5 years old. The move blindsided the technology industry, which thought that its main battle on the immigration front was over the number of H-1B visas \u2014\u00a0granted to\u00a0high-skilled foreign workers \u2014 that will be\u00a0made available each year. The tech sector relies heavily on foreign-born software engineers to meet its staffing needs, and it has long lobbied for the government to lift the cap on the H-1B visa program to allow more foreign workers temporary\u00a0employment\u00a0with\u00a0U.S. firms. But H-1Bs took a backseat on Friday as tech workers and entrepreneurs already legally living and working in the U.S. worried about their own futures. Many were caught off guard by the order\u2019s reach, which extends to lawful permanent residents \u2014\u00a0or green card holders \u2014\u00a0too. \u201cFor those abroad, we are telling them to come back as soon as possible, and be prepared to face questioning and possible refusal,\u201d Akalin said.\u00a0 The order also compelled several big tech companies to break their\u00a0silence about\u00a0the Trump administration. Google Chief Executive Sundar\u00a0Pichai\u00a0slammed the order\u00a0in a memo to employees. \"It\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\" Pichai wrote, according to\u00a0 Bloomberg News . \"We\u2019ve always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.\" Bloomberg reports that the memo urged employees traveling overseas who are affected by the order to seek help from the company\u2019s security and immigration teams. More than 100 employees are affected, Pichai said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.,\u201d a Google spokesperson said.\u00a0\u201cWe'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.\" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, also spoke out against Trump\u2019s action, although in a less direct way, taking to his personal Facebook page to remind his millions of followers that his wife, pediatrician and philanthropist Priscilla Chan , is the daughter of refugees. \u201cMy great grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cThe United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that.\u201d The tech industry has in the past\u00a0highlighted the value of immigrants to American culture and the economy: Steve Jobs was of Syrian descent, high-profile executives at Twitter, Yahoo, Google and eBay are of Iranian descent. Along\u00a0with most of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies,\u00a0the Bay Area\u00a0is home to some 250,000 Muslims, according to a study by the Institute for\u00a0Social Policy and Understanding, of which 60% are foreign-born. Venture capital firms see Trump\u2019s move as a slap in the face, especially since it comes less than two weeks after the Department of Homeland Security passed a rule allowing eligible foreign entrepreneurs to work in the U.S. for up to five years. The rule change\u00a0\u2014 which Silicon Valley saw as a boon, and is expected to take effect July 17 \u2014 was proposed by President Obama last summer. \u201cWe felt that, finally, things were moving forward,\u201d said Zafer Younis, a partner at venture capital firm 500 Startups, which prides itself on its international investments, many of which are in countries that are predominantly Muslim. \u201cThis new development really dampened it.\u201d The executive order increases the uncertainty and risk of investing internationally, Younis said.\u00a0And while 500 Startups will continue investing abroad, there\u2019s concern that other venture capital firms that were once eyeing international opportunities will now get cold feet. \u201cIt changes the risk profile all of a sudden,\u201d he said. But for Younis, it\u2019s personal, too. Originally from Jordan, Younis has lived in the Bay Area for the past two years on an EB-1 visa \u2014 a green card that is granted to those deemed to have \u201cextraordinary ability.\u201d Though Jordan is not on Trump\u2019s list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S., it is a Muslim-majority nation, and it has given him pause. \u201cMy wife is here. I have upcoming business trips to Japan and Europe. I\u2019m not affected, yet I have to think twice \u2014 do I really need to travel or not?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling I thought I left back in the Middle East. It\u2019s an anxiety, that things are beyond your control.\u201d That anxiety is shared by other technologists and entrepreneurs in the Bay Area. Shady, the Egyptian entrepreneur, is also in the U.S. on an EB-1 visa. He and his children have Canadian citizenship, but his wife is an Egyptian citizen. \u201cSo what does that mean?\u201d he said. \u201cIf Egypt is on the list three months from now, what does that mean for our family?\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union on Saturday filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on behalf of two men who were detained at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport while traveling back to the U.S. after\u00a0Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Silicon Valley venture capitalist Chris Sacca tweeted that he would match donations to the ACLU up to $25,000. Tech CEOs are slowly raising their voices. Immigration lawyers are advising their clients to stay put. And in a Silicon Valley mosque where Shady attended Friday prayers, the sheikh\u00a0preached that everyone needs to stand against injustice toward\u00a0all communities, even if their own is not directly affected. \u201cThis is the most important thing for me right now because, even though it doesn\u2019t affect me directly, it\u2019s important for us to all understand what it means to stand against unfairness and the splitting of families,\u201d Shady said.\u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Have the women\u2019s marches started a movement? \u00a0 In the presidential election, just seven of L.A.\u2019s 1,700 precincts went for Trump. \u00a0 In a fiery State of the State, Brown returned to a familiar conclusion. \u00a0 Prosecutors believed two officers feared for their lives when they fatally shot Ezell Ford in 2014. \u00a0 'La La Land' danced its way to 14 Oscar nominations. \u00a0 Mary Tyler Moore \u00a0was a beloved TV icon who symbolized the independent career woman.\u00a0Chinese New Year begins this weekend.

(Jan. 27) AP Protesters gather at JFK International Airport's Terminal 4 on Jan. 28, 2017, to demonstrate against President Trump's executive order to suspend refugee arrivals. (Photo: Bryan R. Smith, AFP/Getty Images) The fallout from\u00a0President Trump's temporary ban\u00a0on refugees to the U.S. struck\u00a0with\u00a0full force Saturday, blocking\u00a0some\u00a0travelers\u00a0from boarding their planes overseas,\u00a0compelling others to turn\u00a0around upon arrival in the U.S., and prompting customs agents\u00a0at New York's JFK Airport to detain at least\u00a0a dozen people, including a former Iraqi translator for the U.S. military in Baghdad. The growing chaos also sparked legal challenges, airport protests, condemnations from politicians and denunciations from\u00a0advocacy groups. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Saturday tweeted an offer of support to those who had been stopped\u00a0at the state's airports: \"I have directed Port Authority, @NYSDOS, & my Counsel's Office to jointly explore all legal options to assist anyone detained at NY airports.\" I have directed Port Authority, @NYSDOS , & my Counsel's Office to jointly explore all legal options to assist anyone detained at NY airports pic.twitter.com/AT8p3rstsD \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) January 28, 2017 Cuomo's tweet linked to a statement in which he objected to refugees being blocked from entering the U.S. \"I never thought I'd see the day when refugees, who have fled war-torn countries in search of a better life, would be turned away from our doorstep. We are a nation of bridges, not walls, and a great many of us still believe in the words 'give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses\u00a0\u2026' \" he wrote. \"This is not who we are, not who we should be.\" Speaking to hundreds of demonstrators at JFK Airport, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,\u00a0called the ban ineffective,\u00a0discriminatory, \"disgusting,\" and said it \"goes against every ounce of our traditions from George Washington onward.\" \"We\u00a0are here to say it\u00a0should\u00a0be stopped and be revoked,\" he said. The reverberations began only\u00a0hours after Trump signed the executive order Friday that\u00a0suspends the entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, halts the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely\u00a0and bars entry for three\u00a0months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of\u00a0Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. In brief remarks while signing his latest executive orders Saturday, Trump maintained the order isn't a \"Muslim ban.\" \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely. We\u2019re going to have a strict ban, and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years,\" he said. More coverage:\u00a0 A Syrian and his American wife are stuck in Iraq because of Trump's ban The ban\u00a0includes green card holders who are authorized to live and work in the United States, according to Gillian Christensen, a Homeland Security spokeswoman,\u00a0 Reuters reported .\u00a0It was unclear how many green card holders would be affected, but exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis, the news agency says. At Washington's Dulles International Airport, where a protest was mounted, Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said the state was considering taking legal action to challenge the ban. About 50 people were detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, said Alia Salem, executive director for DFW Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Families have been waiting at Terminal D in anticipation of meeting relatives who been held up in U.S Customs.\u00a0A representative with CAIR met with families\u00a0waiting for relatives. Some of them have been\u00a0waiting for several hours. At Philadelphia International\u00a0Airport, two Syrian families, described as Christians, were briefly detained Saturday after arriving\u00a0from Qatar and sent back three hours later. The families included two brothers, their wives and two children, according to a family member form Allentown, Pa.,\u00a0 NBC10 reported .\u00a0\"This is like a nightmare come true,\" said Joseph Assali, who noted that the families had visas and green cards legally obtained months ago. Mohammed Al Rawi, chief information officer for Los Angeles County, said on Facebook that his father was removed from a flight in Qatar as a direct result of the order.\u00a0\"My 71 year old dad is in Qatar boarding LAX flight to come visit us and and he's being sent back to Iraq. Some US official told him that Trump canceled all visas,\" he wrote. Foreigners studying at U.S. universities who were part of study abroad programs were also stuck. Even Customs and Border Protection agents were\u00a0confused about how to handle Trump\u2019s order and responding in different ways, he said. Those holding dual nationality in the seven nations involved in the ban will also be barred from entering the United States, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported citing a statement from the\u00a0State Department that has yet to be released.

The authorities stepped in after contacting their counterparts at JFK Airport, where the plane was headed.\u00a0The officials spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. Only one of the 12 picked up at JFK Airport was freed by Saturday afternoon.\u00a0Hameed Khaldi Darweesh, who worked a translator for American forces for 10 years, had been detained overnight\u00a0following his arrival\u00a0from Istanbul. He said he had feared he would be sent back to Iraq, which his family\u00a0fled\u00a0because of death threats. When asked by reporters outside the airport what he thought of Trump, Darweesh\u00a0said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s a president, I\u2019m a normal person.\u201d Posted!

Abed Ayoud, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said they\u2019ve received more than 1,000 calls by midday Saturday from people who have been stranded or detained in the U.S. and abroad. He said legal immigrants traveling overseas to attend funerals and visit family when the president\u00a0signed his order are now unable to return to the U.S. Trump says he will make Christian refugees a priority \u201cThe impact of what President Trump was looking for is in full effect,\u201d Ayoud said. \u201cComplete chaos.\u201d In Tehran, Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said his country would respond by banning all U.S. citizens from the country as long as the U.S. policy was in effect, but would not include\u00a0anyone who already received a\u00a0visa.\u00a0In a statement, the foreign ministry called the U.S. order\u00a0\"a clear insult to the Islamic world, and especially to the great nation of Iran.\" Fact check: President Trump's first week on the job In signing the executive order, Trump said the new administration needed time to develop a stricter screening process for refugees, immigrants and visitors.\u00a0\"I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,\" he said. Trump executive order sows fear among refugees in Ariz. The executive\u00a0order, which he said was aimed at protecting\u00a0Americans from terrorist attacks, singled out Syrian refugees as \"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" When the refugee program resumes, the executive order calls for changes to \"prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\" \"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\" Trump\u00a0said. CAIR said it will file\u00a0a federal lawsuit Monday in the Eastern District of Virginia to challenge\u00a0the constitutionality of the order, charging its apparent purpose and underlying motive is to ban people of the Islamic faith from Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. In N.Y., refugees awaiting family face uncertainty, fear \u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2013 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2013 are a threat to national security,\u201d said CAIR National Litigation Director Lena F. Masri. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups representing the Iraqi men detained at JFK,\u00a0said the lawsuit is directed solely at immigrants who have been caught in legal limbo following Trump\u2019s announcement. The lawyers are trying to expand it into a class action suit to cover the untold number of refugees caught in the same situation. Hincapi\u00e9 said they are planning separate lawsuits challenging the legality of Trump\u2019s executive actions on immigration, partly because they target majority Muslim nations. But she said for now, they simply want to resolve the cases of people who are being detained at airports. They are trying to get an emergency hearing before a judge this weekend.

Got it (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) By Jerry Markon , Emma Brown and David Nakamura By Jerry Markon , Emma Brown and David Nakamura January 28 at 3:06 PM Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @emmersbrown Follow @davidnakamura President Trump\u2019s executive order barring refugees and migrants from predominantly Muslim countries from entry into the United States rippled across the world on Saturday, causing widespread confusion, triggering outrage among immigrant advocates and leading to the detention at U.S. airports of people flying into the country. In addition to blocking all entries from seven countries, including business people, students and others, the ban is also being applied to U.S. legal residents from those nations \u2014 so-called green card holders \u2014 who were traveling abroad at the time the order was signed, federal officials said Saturday. Those familiar with the order, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they said its rollout had been chaotic, said green card holders currently in the United States will not be affected. They noted that the Department of Homeland Security is allowed to grant waivers to those individuals and others deemed to not pose a threat to national security. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been living in the United States for 15 years and you own a business and your family is here, will you be granted a waiver? I\u2019m assuming yes, but we are working that out,\u2019\u2019 said one official, who could not be more specific because details of the possible waivers remained cloudy, as did many other details of how the ban will be enforced. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) But officials made clear that the federal officers detaining refugees and migrants holding valid U.S. visas and restricting them from entering the country were following orders handed down by top DHS officials. Those orders, the officials said, reflect the desires of Trump\u2019s White House. The president\u2019s order, signed Friday, suspends admission to the United States of all refugees for 120 days and bars for 90 days the entry of any citizens from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. Trump said that the goal is to screen out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d and that priority for admission would be given to Christians. [ Trump signs order halting admission of refugees, promises priority for Christians ] The executive action has caused \u201ccomplete chaos\u201d and torn apart families, said Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s causing a negative and destructive impact on the Arab-American community,\u201d Ayoub said. The White House on Saturday rushed to explain and defend its action, saying it strengthens national security and denying that it targeted Muslims. \u201cThe notion that this is a Muslim ban is ludicrous,\u201d one senior administration official said. A second official noted that many majority-Muslim countries, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey, were excluded from the measure. And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who frequently clashed with Trump during the presidential campaign, strongly backed the president\u2019s executive order. \u201cThis is not a religious test and it is not a ban on people of any religion,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThis order does not affect the vast majority of Muslims in the world. It does not affect a large number of nations that are Muslim-majority.\u2019\u2019 Lawyers for two Iraqi men detained at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, one of whom served the U.S. military mission in Iraq, filed a middle-of-the-night lawsuit in federal court challenging Trump\u2019s order as unconstitutional and seeking the release of their clients. They also are seeking class certification so they may represent all refugees and visa-holders who are being held at U.S. ports of entry. 1 of 12 Skip Ad \u00d7 Photos from the scene of protest at New York\u2019s JFK airport against Trump\u2019s executive order halting refu\u00adgee admissions View Photos Entry to the United States is being refused to legal residents, including green-card holders, from seven mostly Muslim countries who were abroad when the executive order was signed Friday by the president, and some travelers were detained at U.S. airports. Caption Entry to the United States is being refused to legal residents, including green-card holders, from seven mostly Muslim countries who were abroad when the executive order was signed Friday by the president, and some travelers were detained at U.S. airports. Jan. 28, 2017 People protest against the Muslim immigration ban at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. President Trump signed an executive order that halted refugees and residents from predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images [ Read the complaint ] One of the men, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released Saturday afternoon without explanation from federal officials, according to his lawyer, Mark Doss. \u201cWe are very grateful that Mr. Darweesh has been released,\u201d Doss told reporters outside JFK International Airport in an interview broadcast on CNN. But 11 others are still being detained at JFK, he said, and \u201cpeople will stay here until they are released.\u201d While immigration advocates said at least one refu\u00adgee family had been detained at San Francisco International Airport, there was no immediate count of how many refugees were being held at airports nationwide. Advocates said that people have not only been held at the border but that ticketed passengers have been barred from boarding U.S.-bound aircraft overseas, and they confirmed that green-card holders who left the U.S. have been unable to return. Cairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 were prevented Saturday from boarding an EgyptAir flight to JFK airport, according to the Associated Press. As outrage mounted, other advocates promised further legal challenges. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) denounced the order and said it would file a lawsuit next week challenging it as unconstitutional. \u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d Lena F. Masri, CAIR\u2019s national litigation director, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d Both Iraqi men detained at JFK airport held valid U.S. visas and had been receiving pro-bono legal assistance for several months from the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project. Betsy Fisher, the organization\u2019s policy director, said the men were in the air on separate flights when Trump signed the temporary refu\u00adgee ban Friday. She called their detention \u201cour worst-case scenario.\u201d \u201cIn the coming weeks we will be advocating to show why this policy is bad for U.S. national security, why it goes against our humanitarian responsibilities, and why it is fundamentally un-American,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cIf there is one fundamentally American value, then it is welcoming those who are fleeing persecution. At our best, this is what we can do.\u201d The International Refugee Assistance Project was among several prominent immigration-rights organizations that filed the lawsuit in New York, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center. One of the Iraqi men detained at JFK is Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, who holds a visa that allowed him to join his wife and young child in Texas. His wife had worked for a U.S. government contractor and came to the United States as a refu\u00adgee in 2014. Darweesh, 53, had worked as a contractor for the U.S. government in Iraq for about a decade, including as an interpreter for the Army. He and his wife and three children had spent more than two years securing a special immigrant visa, granted to Iraqis who assisted U.S. military forces. The Darweesh family landed in New York at approximately 6 p.m. Friday , and Hameed Darweesh was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He is at risk of being returned to a country where he faces enormous personal danger due to his aid to the U.S. government, the complaint says. Darweesh told reporters outside the airport on Saturday that he was thankful so many people came to his aid, leaving their families to help secure his release. \u201cThis is the humanity, this is the soul of America. This is what pushed me to move, to leave my country and come here,\u201d Darweesh said. \u201cAmerica is the land of freedom, the land of freedom, the land of the right. ... America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\u201d Brandon Friedman worked with Darweesh in 2003, when he was an infantry officer with the Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division. He said Darweesh, who was among the first Iraqis to sign up to serve the U.S. military, was \u201cfearless\u201d and saved countless U.S. lives. \u201cThis is a guy who has done a lot more for this country than most people who were born here,\u201d Friedman said. He said he hopes Trump\u2019s executive order is rescinded quickly: \u201cThis is putting U.S. troops in danger because it is withdrawing the incentive that folks like Hameed have to work with us. And we depend on them to a great extent.\u201d The detention of a man who served the U.S. military was particularly objectionable to Matt Zeller, founder of No One Left Behind, which aims to help Iraqi and Afghan people who worked for the U.S. military secure special immigrant visas. He said America is breaking its promise to men and women who served the U.S. military at great personal risk to themselves \u2014 which is not only wrong, he said, but also undermines trust in the United States and endangers the lives of any future service member sent overseas. \u201cThis is going to get future Americans killed in future wars. It comes down to that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to live down this shame if we let this go on.\u201d Marielena Hincapie, executive director for the National Immigration Law Center, said immigration advocates first learned of immigrants being detained Friday evening after a report from a family detained in San Francisco. The advocates attempted to reach U.S. Customs and Border Protection but were unsuccessful. \u201cWe were trying to find out if it was lack of communication or what was the plan?\u201d she said in an interview Saturday morning. The lawyers for those detained at JFK said they were told officials at the airport couldn\u2019t help them when they began to seek their clients\u2019 release. \u201cWho is the person to talk to?\u201d the attorneys asked, according to the court complaint. The CBP agents responded: \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump.\u201d Louisa Loveluck in Beirut, and Philip Rucker, Mike DeBonis, Lori Aratani, Carol Morello, Katherine Shaver and Rachel Weiner in Washington contributed to this report. local ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Jan 28, 2017 11:02 AM EST At the Pentagon for a swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary Ret. Gen. James Mattis, Donald Trump signed two executive actions -- one on rebuilding the military and one making major changes to America\u2019s policies on refugees and immigration. \u201cI\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States,\u201d the president told an audience at the Pentagon Friday. Donald Trump calls for \u201cextreme\u201d ideological screening test for new immigrants Hours later the White House released details of the executive order titled \u201cProtecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States.\u201d It indefinitely suspends the United States\u2019 Syrian refugees program, which Trump had vowed to do on the campaign trail.\u00a0 U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order he said would impose tighter vetting to prevent foreign terrorists from entering the United States at the Pentagon in Washington, U.S., January 27, 2017. REUTERS It says \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and suspends \u201cany such entry\u201d until the president has determined that \u201csufficient changes have been made to the USRAP [U.S. Refugee Admissions Program] to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\u201d Trump\u2019s order directs the State Department to stop issuing visas to Syrian nationals and halts the processing of Syrian refugees. That will remain in effect until Trump determines that enough security changes have been made to ensure that would-be terrorists can\u2019t exploit weaknesses in the current vetting system.\u00a0 The president, during his signing of the order at the Department of Homeland Security, also called on the Pentagon and the State Department to create a plan for safe zones in and around Syria to offer protection for Syrians fleeing the war there. But the signed order itself makes no mention of a plan for safe zones in Syria. A draft of the order had directed the Pentagon and the State Department to produce a plan for safe zones in the war-torn Mideast nation. Several other points included in the action: Trump ordered a 120-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which is America\u2019s broader refugee program. The suspension is intended to provide time to review how refugees are vetted before they are allowed to resettle in the United States. \u00a0 The executive action appears to be capping the number of refugees from other countries at 50,000 people in in fiscal year 2017, saying more than that \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\u00a0 The action says that when U.S. Refugee Admissions Program admissions resume, the Secretary of State in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, \u201cto prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s order did not spell out specifically what additional steps he wants to see the Homeland Security and State departments to add to the country\u2019s vetting system for refugees. Instead he directed officials to the review the refugee application and approval process to find any other security measures that can be added to prevent people who pose a threat from using the refugee program. Trump\u2019s executive order suspends all immigration from countries with terrorism concerns for 90 days. It was unclear from the law cited in the order which countries would be affected, though a draft of the order pointed to a legal provision that identified Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, all majority-Muslim countries, for at least 30 days. The order also calls for Homeland Security and State Department officials, along with the director of national intelligence, to review what information the government needs to fully vet would-be visitors and come up with a list of countries that don\u2019t provide it. The order says the government will give countries 60 days to start providing the information or citizens from those countries will be barred from traveling to the United States. In a portion of an interview released Friday, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that one group of refugees could look forward to some relief. He told the Christain Broadcasting Network that Christians in Syria find it \u201calmost impossible to get into the United States.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cThe reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody -- but more so the Christians,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d Christians comprise about 10 percent of the Syrian population, according to the CIA World Fact Book. Before the details of the action came to light, uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s plans to ban immigrants from certain countries from entering the U.S. caused stress among some already. Nuha Alsakkaff fled her war-torn country of Yemen six years ago. CBS Evening News Nuha Alsakkaff, 26, fled her war-torn country of Yemen more than six years ago. Alsakkaff is now a U.S citizen and is trying to get the rest of her family here, too. But if immigrants from Yemen are banned, she says she\u2019ll be devastated. \u201cI can\u2019t save my people. I can\u2019t save my family,\u201d she told CBS News . ",

HeldermanThe Washington Post The seven nations targeted for new visitation restrictions by President Donald Trump on Friday all have something in common: They are places he does not appear to have any business interests. The executive order he signed Friday bars all entry for the next 90 days by travelers from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. Excluded from the lists are several majority-Muslim nations where the Trump Organization is active and which in some cases have also faced troublesome issues with terrorism. According to the text of the order, the restriction applies to countries that have already been excluded from programs allowing people to travel to the United States without a visa because of concerns over terrorism. Hewing closely to nations already named as terrorism concerns elsewhere in law might have allowed the White House to avoid angering some more powerful and wealthy majority Muslim allies, such as Egypt. But without divesting from his company, as bipartisan ethics experts had advised, Trump is now facing questions about whether he designed the new rules with his own business at least partly in mind. \"He needs to sell his businesses outside his family and place the assets in a blind trust, otherwise every decision he makes people are going to question if he's making the decision in the interests of the American people or his own bottom line,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. The group has filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump is already in violation of a constitutional provision barring federal officials from accepting payments from foreign officials. Earlier in the week, Norm Eisen, the group's chairman and a former ethics adviser to Barack Obama, tweeted: \"WARNING: Mr. Pres. your Muslim ban excludes countries where you have business interests. That is a CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION. See u in court.\" Read the story Stephanie Grisham, a White House spokeswoman, said, \"The high-risk territories are based on Congressional statute and nothing else.\" Trump has said he has handed management of his real estate, licensing and merchandising business over to his adult sons to avoid the perception that he is making presidential decisions to boost his own business. But he has retained ownership of the company, meaning that if it thrives during his presidency, he will personally profit. The new executive order points to the complications that are likely to arise from the arrangement. Trump's order makes no mention of Turkey, which has faced several terrorist attacks in recent months. On Wednesday, the State Department updated a travel warning for Americans visiting Turkey, noting that \"an increase in anti-American rhetoric has the potential to inspire independent actors to carry out acts of violence against US citizens.\" Trump has licensed his name to two luxury towers in Istanbul. A Turkish company also manufactures a line of Trump-branded home furnishings. Trump's most recent financial disclosure, filed in May when he was a presidential candidate, showed that he had earned as much as $6 million in the previous year from the deals. President Donald Trump's sweeping executive order to suspend refugee arrivals and impose tough controls on travellers from seven countries was met with protests at U.S. airports.\u00a0 \"I have a little conflict of interest 'cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\" he said in a December 2015 interview with Breitbart News. More recently, he has insisted that he has no conflicts because laws making conflicts illegal do not apply to the president. Also untouched by Friday's executive order is the United Arab Emirates, a powerful Muslim ally with whom the United States nevertheless has complicated relations. Trump has licensed his name to a Dubai golf resort, as well as a luxury home development and spa. Trump has seemed particularly disinclined to divorce himself of interests in the project. Its developer, Hussain Sajwani, attended a New Year's Eve party at Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, where a video showed Trump singling him out for praise, calling him and his family \"the most beautiful people.\" Trump returned to the topic of his Dubai partnership again in mid-January at a news conference intended to demonstrate how he was separating from his business. \"Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East - Hussein, Damac, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai - a number of deals and I turned it down,\" Trump said then, referring to Sajwani's development company. His point was that he was voluntarily turning aside new projects that could raise ethical questions. An attorney for the company announced at the same event that the Trump Organization will embark on no new foreign deals while Trump is in office. But the comment also served as a reminder that Trump's business, included the personal relationships he forged with wealthy partners around the world, was still very much on his mind as he entered the presidency. The executive order makes no mention of Saudi Arabia, home of 15 of the 19 terrorists involved in the 9/11 attacks. The Trump Organization had incorporated several limited liability companies in preparation for an attempt to build a hotel in Saudi Arabia, showing an interest in expansion in the country. The company canceled those incorporations in December, indicating that no project is moving forward. Excluded as well is Indonesia, the world's largest majority-Muslim nation, where there are two large Trump-branded resorts underway, built in partnership with powerful local interests. \"To be blunt, we really don't know what to make of which motives are driving this president's decisions,\" said Kamal Essaheb, director of policy and advocacy for the National Immigration Law Center. \"From what we could tell from his campaign and his actions since he became president, what seems to be first and foremost on his mind is his own self-interest and an obsession with his brand.\" ",

Norman Eisen, President Obama's\u00a0\"ethics czar\" and the principal author of that administration's\u00a0executive order on lobbying, said Trump kept the\u00a0Obama limits on the \"revolving door\" coming into government but eliminated Obama's revolving door protections for non-lobbyists leaving government. \"There is much to like in the EO (executive order),\" said Eisen, now chairman of Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington. \"But it gives\u00a0non-lobbyists too much leeway when they leave. That is where the biggest problem in the system is: unregistered, shadow lobbyists. They should be getting more regulation, not less.\" The ethics order signed by Obama after he became president in 2009 barred appointees from accepting gifts from registered lobbyists or lobbying organizations. It also banned any of his officials from participation in a decision that affected lobbying clients from the previous two years, or working with any executive agency that person had lobbied over the previous two years. Appointees leaving government during the Obama administration are banned from\u00a0communicating with workers in their agency for two years and cannot lobby \u201ccovered executive branch official or non-career Senior Executive Service appointee for the remainder of the Administration.\u201d Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jCliog NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

His dream of a better life was abruptly crushed when President Donald Trump banned Syrian refugees from the U.S. until further notice. Sawan learned of the entry ban while watching late night TV news with his wife in their small apartment in the Jordanian capital of Amman. Related: Trump Travel Restrictions Leave Refugees Stranded: Reports \"When we heard of the order, it was like a bolt of lightning, and all our hopes and dreams vanished,\" the 40-year-old said Saturday, a day after Trump's executive order. He and other Syrian refugees bristled at the idea that they pose a potential security threat, saying they are peaceful people fleeing persecution. Some warned that the new U.S. policy will be seen as targeting Muslims and further inflame anti-American sentiment in the region.

Trump on Friday suspended all refugee admissions to the U.S. for four months and banned the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely pending a security review meant to ensure terrorists cannot slip through vetting. Trump also issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria. At the time of Trump's decision, more than 27,000 Syrian refugees from 11 Middle Eastern host countries were being considered for resettlement to the U.S. and were in various stages of the approval process, according to the International Organization for Migration.

Close to 5 million Syrians have fled their country since an uprising against President Bashar Assad erupted in 2011 and escalated into civil war. Most refugees have settled in neighboring countries, including Jordan and Lebanon where their struggle for survival gets tougher every day. Savings have run out, jobs are poorly paid and refugee children learn in crowded classrooms. Many refugees prefer to return home, but that's not an option as long as the war continues. Eager to escape tough conditions in the host countries, resettlement to the West now seems the best alternative. Related: Trump Signs Order Suspending Admission of Syrian Refugees Ammar Sawan fled the Damascus suburb of Moadamiyeh in 2012, after he was roughed up by pro-Assad militiamen and feared eventual arrest. His wife Sanaa, 35, and three sons followed him a year later, fleeing government shelling. The couple had a fourth child, a girl, in Jordan, last year. The family struggles to cover rent, utilities and school transportation for the three oldest, especially during the winter when Sawan's income from his part-time work as an upholsterer drops. Sawan worries about his children, including bullying in school. His oldest, 15-year-old Khaled, said Jordanian students sometimes pick fights with Syrians school mates. \u201cIt will not make America safer. It will make America smaller and meaner.\u201d Sawan said he underwent the first round of security vetting for possible resettlement to the U.S. in October. With a new life in America suddenly in reach, he began to dream of a decent education for his children and a stable income for the family. \"My dream, even before the war in Syria, was to live in America,\" he said, as the family huddled around a gas heater in the living room. Now he is disappointed in America. \"We are not terrorists and we don't support terrorism,\" he said. Refugee aid groups said Trump's ban is hurting innocent people. \"It will not make America safer,\" Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said by phone from Oslo. \"It will make America smaller and meaner.\" He said the new U.S. policy deals a blow to international responsibility for those fleeing persecution, an idea forged in the aftermath of the Holocaust when Jews and others seeking safe haven were often let down. Others said U.S. security checks of refugees are already robust, involving biometric screening and up to three years of vetting. Play ",

Jan. 20, 2017 (Photo: By Pat McDonogh, The CJ) The nation's immigrants watched in trepidation Saturday as President Trump's immigration ban went into effect with abrupt results. The executive order temporarily banning all refugees \u2014\u00a0as well as more specific restrictions on predominantly Muslim countries \u2014\u00a0drew lawsuits, protests and outrage on social media as travelers were stopped from boarding U.S-bound planes and detained at international airports. Across the country, some immigrants already in the United States were enveloped in feelings of fear and uncertainty. \u00a0 Phoenix - Ibado\u00a0Mahmud Ibado Mahmud of Phoenix arrived in the United States as a refugee in 1993 after fleeing the civil war in Somalia. \u00a0(Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) Ibado Mahmud came to the United States as a refugee in 1993 after fleeing the civil war in her native\u00a0Somalia\u00a0and spending more than two years living in a refugee camp in neighboring Kenya. Today, she is one of 7,193 Somali refugees resettled in Arizona since 1992. It's a far cry from her\u00a0old life. She recalls fleeing Somalia for her life with her husband and two young daughters in December 1990 and then driving in a car to Kenya with a caravan of nearly 50 other refugees. She saw people die and be raped. \"You heard the lions roaring every night,\" she said. \"I used to wrap me and my two girls in long clothes so if the lion came, he would have to eat all three of us.\" Since coming to the U.S., Mahmud has rebuilt her life in Arizona and raised seven children.\u00a0She owns her own house and for the past 17 years has worked at\u00a0Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, alongside refugees from Iraq, Eritrea, Libya, Sudan,\u00a0Ethiopia\u00a0and many other countries. More coverage:\u00a0 Iran says U.S. citizens aren't welcome But Mahmud worries other refugees\u00a0 will not get the same chance \u00a0because of\u00a0Trump's decision Friday to temporarily freeze the arrival of all refugees and indefinitely halt the arrival of refugees from Syria. \"A lot of people are grateful to be here, to be part of this country. We appreciate what the United States did for us,\" the 56-year-old\u00a0said. \"We are hoping they will do many other great things to people who are hurting, that people who are dying for no reason, to people who don't have a life.\" Mahmud said she has felt welcome in the U.S. but worries Trump's executive orders could lead to discrimination against Muslims like her. \"What I am scared of is that he is going to divide us,\" she said. Louisville -\u00a0Masjid Bilal Islamic Center Mohamoud Saidi, from Somalia, signs a petition on his phone in support of refugees after Friday prayers at Louisville's Masjid Bilal Islamic Center  . \u00a0(Photo: Chris Kenning) At the Masjid Bilal Islamic Center in West Louisville on Friday afternoon , dozens of refugees from Somalia, Syria and Iraq gathered for prayers. They said many were now cut off from ailing or impoverished family members who were trying to join them in the U.S., and some worried about what some called an atmosphere of \u201cIslamophobia.\u201d Advocates were organizing rallies of support. \"It is devastating,\" said Abanur Saidi, chairman of the mosque who also works with refugees for Catholic Charities and who is among thousands of Somalis in the Louisville region. \"These are people that don't have anything to do with terrorism. They are victims of terror, that's why they are leaving their country.\" Others said they worried the new Trump directive would be counter-productive. 'Complete chaos,' 1,000 calls after Trump immigrant ban hits \u201cThis policy seems to be directed at the Muslims \u2014 and I\u2019m really concerned that this decision will strengthen terrorists and extremist groups, they will have more material to brainwash people that America is against Islam,\u201d said Mohammad Babar, a Muslim leader in Louisville. Those at the Bilal mosque Friday were signing a petition organized by a coalition of refugee groups seeking to get 10,000 signatures before a planned rally next month. Leaders are urging supporters to write letters to legislators. Meantime, the Louisville Muslim Community and a coalition of groups said they would host an event Saturday to highlight the importance of dialogue and consider grassroots actions in the face of what they called \"increasing Islamaphobia\" and other issues. \u201cOur president is trying to divide us,\u201d said Farhan Abdi, executive director of Muslim Americans for Compassion. He said refugees and immigrants are \u201cdoctors, teachers, lawyers, business owners, factory workers\" who will \"keep fighting to keep America welcoming.\u201d Rochester, N.Y. - Charlotte Gosso Charlotte Gosso, with her sons Ephraim, 10, and Guy, 22, in the apartment they live in in Rochester Friday, Jan. 27, 2017.  The family emigrated here from C\u0099ote d'Ivoire.  Guy is also bed ridden. \u00a0(Photo: SHAWN DOWD/@sdowdphoto/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) Charlotte Gosso came to Rochester in December from\u00a0C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\u00a0 via a refugee camp \u00a0in Ghana; she was the first Ivoirian refugee here. Her prayers go to her country and her relatives there, the only ones she has. There are only a handful of Ivoirians in Rochester, and it seems unlikely any more will be arriving. Gosso thinks of a woman she knew in the refugee camp in Ghana. It would take Gosso up to three days to travel to\u00a0Accra, the capital, for bureaucratic matters, and there was no one to watch her son while she was gone. The woman would help her, and give her some rice when she needed it to feed her sons. Trump immigration ban sends shockwaves through tech industry The woman and her husband would like to come to the United States, and Gosso would welcome them. She speaks only French and is confined to her small apartment unless someone can help her with Guy. Lisa Hoyt, director of the Catholic Family Center's Refugee, Immigration & Language Services Department, described another case. A mother and seven children were supposed to arrive in Rochester on Tuesday. The family is Somali but is living in a refugee camp in Kenya. The oldest of the children is 19. The youngest is 2. Their new life here is waiting. But someone in the group got sick, postponing their travel. \"Think about what's happened,\" she said. \"These people literally could have missed this opportunity ... through no fault of their own.\" Indianapolis - Abdul and Manal Caught in the middle of the Syrian civil war, Abdul and Manal fled the bombs and the fighting in the city of Homs . In December 2015, after years in a refugee camp, the door opened for them to come to America and, more specifically, Indianapolis. The young couple joined a tiny colony of Syrian refugees who\u2019ve been relocated\u00a0here by groups such as Catholic Charities, as in their case, and Exodus Refugee Immigration. In a little more than two years, Exodus has resettled 225 Syrians to Indianapolis. Catholic Charities has resettled 77 Syrians. More than a year after their arrival, Abdul (whose full name is Abdul Sater Khaled Assaf) and Manal (al Khadour) are making a decent life for themselves and their two young daughters. But the immigration controversy leaves them fearful that the loved ones they left behind \u2014 namely Abdul\u2019s parents and his brother \u2014 could be denied a similar rescue. \u201cI\u2019m concerned a lot that they might not get to come,\u201d Manal said in Arabic, through his Catholic Charities translator, Sajjad Jawad, himself once a refugee from Iraq. Syrian refugees Abdul Sater Khaled Assaf, left, his wife Manal Al Khadour, right, and their children Lareen and Leen share a moment in their north side home, Thursday, January 26, 2017. \u00a0(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar) Abdul and Manal say they like Indiana \u2014 even the weather, which they say is similar to Homs. But the joy of their new life is tempered by their awareness of the death and destruction they left behind in Syria.\u00a0They worry about their family in refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, where they say life is hard. They doubt they\u2019ll ever see their homeland again. Abdul has been picking up what he can about American politics. Asked if he could tell President Trump something about the Syrian refugee situation, he said: \u201cI would tell him \u2018Bring the refugees. Let them come. Because I lived with them. And I know the conditions.\u2019 \u201d Contributing:\u00a0Daniel Gonzalez, The Arizona Republic; Chris Kenning, The (Louisville, Ky.)

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Peaceful protests began forming Saturday afternoon at Kennedy Airport, where nine travelers had been detained upon arrival at Terminal 7 and two others at Terminal 4, an airport official said. Similar scenes were playing out at other airports across the nation. An official message to all American diplomatic posts around the world provided instructions about how to treat people from the countries affected: \u201cEffective immediately, halt interviewing and cease issuance and printing\u201d of visas to the United States. Internationally, confusion turned to panic as travelers found themselves unable to board flights bound for the United States. In Dubai and Istanbul, airport and immigration officials turned passengers away at boarding gates and, in at least one case, ejected a family from a flight it had boarded. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Seyed Soheil Saeedi Saravi, a promising young Iranian scientist, had been scheduled to travel in the coming days to Boston, where he had been awarded a fellowship to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard, according to Thomas Michel, the professor who was to supervise the research fellowship. But Professor Michel said the visas for the student and his wife had been indefinitely suspended. \u201cThis outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,\u201d Professor Michel wrote to The New York Times. Document: Motion for Class Certification in Refugee Detentions Peter McPherson, the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, which represents many of the biggest public colleges in the country, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the new policy. He said it was \u201ccausing significant disruption and hardship\u201d for students, researchers, faculty and staff members. A Syrian family of six who have been living in a Turkish refugee camp since fleeing their home in 2014 had been scheduled to arrive in Cleveland on Tuesday . Instead, the family\u2019s trip has been called off. \u201cEveryone is just so heartbroken, so angry, so sad,\u201d said Danielle Drake, the community manager for US Together, an agency that resettles refugees. Daniel W. Drezner, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., posted an angry message for Mr. Trump on Twitter after the executive order stopped the arrival of a Syrian family his synagogue had sponsored. In an interview on Friday night on \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d on MSNBC, he expressed sorrow for the fate of the family and apologized for cursing in his Twitter message.

A Christian family of six from Syria said in an email to Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, that they were being detained at Philadelphia International Airport on Saturday morning despite having legal paperwork, green cards and visas that had been approved. In the case of the two Iraqis held at Kennedy Airport, the legal filings by his lawyers say that Mr. Darweesh was granted a special immigrant visa on Jan. 20, the same day Mr. Trump was sworn in as president. A husband and father of three, Mr. Darweesh arrived at Kennedy Airport with his family. Mr. Darweesh\u2019s wife and children made it through passport control and customs, but agents of Customs and Border Protection detained him. In Istanbul, during a stopover on Saturday, passengers reported that security officers had entered a plane after everyone had boarded and ordered a young Iranian woman and her family to leave the aircraft. Iranian green card holders who live in the United States were blindsided by the decree while on vacation in Iran, finding themselves in a legal limbo and unsure whether they would be able to return to America. \u201cHow do I get back home now?\u201d said Daria Zeynalia, a green card holder who was visiting family in Iran.

Buzz60 Protesters rally during a demonstration against the immigration ban at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Jan. 28, 2017 in New York City. (Photo: Stephanie Keith, Getty Images) World leaders reacted harshly Saturday to President Trump's executive order suspending immigration and visas for citizens from\u00a0certain countries with majority\u00a0Muslim populations.\u00a0Iran, one of the targeted nations, suggested\u00a0it would limit issuing visas to American tourists. Trump on Friday suspended all refugee admissions to the U.S. for four months and banned the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely pending a security review meant to ensure terrorists cannot slip through vetting. Trump also issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria. The official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \u201ccounteraction\u201d to Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201cIran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals,\" the statement reads. \u201cIt will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\u201d More coverage:\u00a0 A Syrian and his American wife are stuck in Iraq because of Trump's ban The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif issued a series of tweets in response to President Trump's order, saying the move would be \"a great gift to extremists and their supporters.\" He explained that statement further, tweeting: \"Collective discrimination aids terrorist recruitment by deepening fault-lines exploited by extremist demagogues to swell their ranks.\" Collective discrimination aids terrorist recruitment by deepening fault-lines exploited by extremist demagogues to swell their ranks. 2/7 \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) January 28, 2017 A follow-up tweet promised a reciprocal response: \"While respecting Americans & differentiating between them & hostile U.S. policies, Iran will take reciprocal measures to protect citizens.\" While respecting Americans & differentiating between them &hostile U.S. policies, Iran will take reciprocal measures to protect citizens.5/7 \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) January 28, 2017 Other world leaders, including officials from Canada and Scotland, also tweeted responses to the new U.S. policy.

    "text": "Lawmakers Won't Publicly Commit to 'Bathroom Bill' Repeal By jonathan drew and gary d. robertson, associated press RALEIGH, N.C. \u0097 Jan 28, 2017, 3:42 PM ET 0 Shares Email North Carolina's governor insists there are enough votes to kill the state's \"bathroom bill.\" But a survey by The Associated Press and eight North Carolina newspapers shows less than a third of lawmakers are willing to publicly commit to that stance. A closely watched deal to repeal the law fell apart during a December special session amid distrust between Democrats and Republicans. The law known as House Bill 2 sparked backlash from businesses and LGBT advocates who say it's discriminatory because it requires transgender people to use restrooms in many public buildings that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. It also excludes sexual orientation and gender identity from statewide antidiscrimination protections. Only 12 of 50 state senators and 40 of 118 current House members said they support abolishing the law, nearly all of them Democrats. On the other side, 13 representatives and six senators said firmly that they want the law to remain. But the survey doesn't give a clear answer about the likelihood of undoing the law. In both chambers, those giving a \"yes\" or \"no\" were outnumbered by those on the fence or declining to participate. \"It's going to be a heavy lift. I hesitate to comment one way or another without seeing a specific proposal,\" said Republican Rep. Josh Dobson, who represents mountain counties. About 10 Republicans in each chamber said they were open to finding a solution but would have to see what's included in a repeal bill. The survey was conducted over the opening days of this year's legislative session. Many Republican lawmakers are likely keeping their views private to discourage public squabbling, said Republican Mike Hager, who served as House Majority Leader before leaving the legislature last year. The House Republican Caucus has been divided over repeal legislation. Hager also said many GOP legislators from rural, socially conservative areas are torn between concerns about HB2 hampering economic activity and the desire to protect bathroom privacy and respect religious views. \"People have deep-seated feelings about family norms,\" Hager said. \"You've got to have someone brave enough and offer a compromise, because that is what it's going to take.\" The survey, sent Jan. 19 by email, asked legislators if they would \"vote to repeal House Bill 2 in its entirety\" if such legislation were introduced. Reporters also contacted lawmakers by phone or in person over the following week. Rep. Chuck McGrady, a Republican from mountainous Henderson County, was among those who refused to answer \"yes\" or \"no,\" saying: \"It really depends on what else is with it. If we're talking about a straight repeal and nothing else, I don't know.\" Many Republicans say the law is needed to protect safety and privacy, while critics say those dangers are nonexistent. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper repeated his assertion that there are enough votes for full repeal in a statement Saturday, saying he has spoken to both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. He urged state Senate leader Phil Berger to allow a simple vote on the law's merits. \"If there ever was a need for bipartisanship, it's now. We came too close in December for Sen. Berger to give up. Too many jobs, too much investment, too much of North Carolina's reputation are at stake,\" Cooper said. Berger, responding to the survey, said he has told Cooper that repeal will require compromise and that \"I'm encouraged that his response to those concerns is that he wants to work something out.\" But Berger also told Time Warner Cable News Thursday that he doesn't believe there are enough votes \"for an outright repeal without anything else.\" Some Republicans said they will not vote for repeal without leaving part of the bathroom provision intact. Others have favored limiting local governments' antidiscrimination measures. The law was a response to an antidiscrimination ordinance in Charlotte, home to Republican Rep. Andy Dulin. He said he expects lawmakers crafting a repeal bill will be cautious to avoid another showdown with local governments. \"I am of the opinion that we need to let our urban centers and our state move forward,\" said Dulin, whose district suffered from the withdrawal of the ACC football championship, the NBA All-Star Game and business projects. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Drew at www.twitter.com/jonldrew and Robertson at www.twitter.com/garydrobertson 0 Shares ",

    "text": "12 refugees detained under ban after Trump's order; one released Published               January 28, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Twelve refugees were detained at JFK Airport within hours of President Trump's order restricting immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations. \u00a0 One of the Iraqis, Hameed Jhalid Darweesh, 53, was released by midday Saturday. \u201cI suffered to move here, to get my family here \u2026. I can\u2019t go back,\u201d Darweesh said shortly after his release, according to the New York Post. Asked if he\u2019d be killed in Iraq, he answered: \u201cYes, yes.\u201d Hameed Khalid Darweesh, an Army interpreter in Iraq, had been stopped as he traveled with his wife and three kids when agents pulled him aside, according to the New York Times. The fate of the other Iraqi detainee, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, was unclear. So was the fate of 10 other refugees, whose nationalities were not immediately known. Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D-Manhattan) and Nydia Velazquez (D-Brooklyn) announced the number of refugees held at the airport. \u201cThis should not happen in America. We shouldn\u2019t have to demand the release of refugees one by one,\u201d the two members of Congress said in a statement. Expand / Contract Protesters assemble at JFK Airport after two Iraqi refugees were detained. (AP) \"They have been detained illegally. I am begging you to go and revisit this. It's ill-advised, it's mean spirited,\" said Velazquez, during a press conference.\u00a0 The White House moved Saturday to defend the president\u2019s refugee order, saying Muslims are not being targeted. \u201cThe notion that this is a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 is ludicrous,\u201d a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News. Other travelers were being stopped from boarding U.S.-bound flights at overseas airports as the Trump refugee ban went into effect Friday night. Early Saturday, immigration lawyers in New York sued to block the order, claiming that numerous people have already been unlawfully detained at U.S. airports, Reuters reported. Trump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. A U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. That covers legal permanent residents -- green card holders -- and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. The official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. The official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. The official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. Customs and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. The order also imposes a temporary ban on travelers from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen. Immigration lawyers filed papers in Brooklyn Federal Court seeking the release of the two Iraqis and an order certifying the case as a class-action on behalf of others who they said were being illegally detained at ports of entry, according to the paper. The lawyers said custom agents wouldn\u2019t let them meet with their clients who they said had valid visas to enter the U.S. \u201cWho is the person we need to talk to?\u201d asked Mark Doss, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project. \u201cMr. President,\u201d the paper quoted a customs agent as responding. \u201cCall Mr. Trump.\u201d President Donald Trump signs an executive order on extreme vetting during an event at the Pentagon in Washington, Friday, Jan. 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) The ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project is also representing the two Iraqis. \u201cPresident Trump's war on equality is already taking a terrible human toll. This ban cannot be allowed to continue,\u201d\u00a0the group's Omar Jadwat said. In Cairo, airport officials prevented seven U.S.-bound migrants -- six from Iraq and one from Yemen -- from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York. The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at JFK. Qatar Airways told passengers bound for the U.S. from the seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. A statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" It listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. Late Friday, the International Rescue Committee called Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. The group\u2019s president David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" He said the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust -- involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \u201cThis is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans,\u201d he said.

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Jan 28, 2017 11:01 AM EST President Trump has been in office for a week and has taken advantage of his executive powers by beginning to craft and impose his administration\u2019s policies. Seven days into his first term, Mr. Trump has issued more than a dozen executive actions, which include a government-wide freeze on new and pending regulations, the reinstatement of a policy that bars U.S. funding to health providers abroad that discuss abortion as an option and a call for the construction of a physical wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Most of the actions taken so far are technically presidential memoranda, and four have been executive orders, which have the force of law and must be published in the Federal Register. Historically, presidents have embraced the executive order as a tool to use when there\u2019s a lack of action from Congress. Some have been infamously contentious -- President Franklin Roosevelt signed one in 1942 that established internment camps during World War II. What happens when Trump signs executive action on Mexico border wall? Mr. Trump issued an executive order Friday that temporarily bans immigration to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries and indefinitely suspends the Syrian refugee program. The president said in his order that their entry \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d Julian Zelizer, history and public affairs professor at Princeton University, said of the order, \u201cThe power of the president on national security is vast, especially post-9/11.\u201d But he went on to say, \u201cI\u2019m sure that will be challenged.\u201d Here are some of the major actions that Mr. Trump has taken so far: Obamacare Within hours of being sworn in a week ago, Mr. Trump signed his first executive order , which seeks to \u201cminimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens\u201d of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The order directs the head of Health and Human Services and other departments to use their authority to \u201cwaive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or cost, fee, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance or makers of medical devices, products and medications.\u201d Mark Peterson, chairman of the Public Policy Department at UCLA, said that the order \u201cis more of a planted flag\u201d and that there are \u201csignificant constraints on what the president can do with an executive or domestic issue like this one.\u201d The Trump administration could change rules related to Obamacare , Peterson said, that were developed as part of the regulatory process. He pointed out, however, that any new, proposed regulations would have to comply with existing law and would be subject to a lengthy and complex process that would take months to implement them. Top aide defends Trump's executive order on Obamacare \u201cWhat the executive order does do is simply add further uncertainty to the process, which itself is something President Trump may wish to accomplish,\u201d he said. \u201cUncertainty unnerves insurance companies, and that may lead to eventual market withdrawals and more destabilization of the market. That could lead to market collapse. Then the administration and Republicans will strive to claim that Obamacare collapsed under its own weight.\u201d Robert J. Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health, agrees that the order itself is not going to affect many people, but it does have enormous significance politically. \u201cIf I am a governor, a president of an insurance company, I\u2019m somebody enrolling, I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t know what this thing does, but this is a signal that this new president places as job number one, getting rid of this law,\u201d he said. The talking points given to Congress by the White House said that one goal of this executive order was \u201cto help get the mandates and penalties off the backs of the poorest and sickest Americans.\u201d The ACA\u2019s\u00a0 individual mandate \u00a0requires that Americans purchase health care insurance or pay a penalty. But this provision was already somewhat weakened by the fact that the law gave the IRS no real ability to enforce the payment of the penalty. The only recourse the tax collecting agency has is to subtract the penalty from the taxpayer\u2019s refund. And if the taxpayer isn\u2019t entitled to a refund, the IRS can carry the penalty over to the following year. Building a border wall During a visit to the Department of Homeland Security Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that calls on the department\u2019s secretary to \u201ctake all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border.\u201d\u00a0 But it won\u2019t be that simple. Philip Schrag, a Georgetown law professor whose expertise includes immigration policy, said the U.S. doesn\u2019t own all of the land adjacent to the border. \u201cIn Texas, apparently there are a great many of the lands adjacent to the border in private hands, so the government would first have to seize the land by eminent domain or purchase it from the owners and then deal with the construction problems,\u201d he said. The order also calls on the DHS secretary to identify and allocate funding for the wall\u2019s construction and prepare long-term budget requests to submit to Congress. House Speaker Paul Ryan is already on board and ready to work with the president to fund the wall. Mr. Trump also called for the hiring of 5,000 more Border Patrol agents and the construction of detention facilities near the U.S. border with Mexico, although that is dependent on Congress allocating money for the hires. Schrag added that the migration of animals along the border will also pose an obstacle to building the wall and the U.S. will have to spend years funding this project. \u201cThe challenges of building a physical wall in that terrain are going to mean that this is an extremely expensive project, requiring billions of dollars of appropriations over a period of years,\u201d he said. Defunding \u201csanctuary cities\u201d Mr. Trump signed another executive order Wednesday that intends to allow the attorney general and homeland security secretary to make a determination whether certain cities, known as \u201c sanctuary cities ,\u201d are not eligible for federal grants. Schrag, however, said that the order doesn\u2019t make sense because it says states and cities can\u2019t receive federal grants if they willfully refuse to comply with the law, U.S. Code 1373. \u201cThat\u2019s a little bit puzzling because that subsection of the U.S. Code doesn\u2019t actually require the cities to maintain any information about the immigration status of people they apprehend or people living in the cities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt only prohibits the officials of states and governments from refusing to send such information to the Department of Homeland Security. It doesn\u2019t require anybody to maintain that information. So if the city of New York apprehends somebody for a misdemeanor, this section does not require it to inquire into that person\u2019s immigration status.\u201d President Trump signs order to strip sanctuary cities of federal funding The order also says the DHS must prioritize deportations for people in the U.S. illegally who have been convicted of a criminal offense, have been charged with one, have engaged in fraud and abused any program related to public benefits, among other criteria. It also calls for the hiring of 10,000 more immigration officers, which Congress would have to agree to allocate funding for.\u00a0 Many mayors are resisting the threat posed by the executive order, though not all. Fearing a loss of millions of dollars from the federal government, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez\u00a0 ordered county jails \u00a0to begin complying with federal immigration detention demands. The move effectively unravels Miami-Dade\u2019s status as a \u201csanctuary\u201d for the undocumented. Hiring freeze on civilian government employees A memorandum Mr. Trump issued Monday imposed a freeze on all federal civilian employees \u201cacross the board\u201d in the executive branch. Beginning last Sunday, no vacant positions were allowed to be filled and no new positions could be created \u201cexcept in limited circumstances.\u201d The memorandum does not apply to military personnel, and it instructed the director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a long-term plan \u201cto reduce the size of the federal government\u2019s workforce through attrition.\u201d Reinstating the Mexico City policy On Monday, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum that reinstates the Mexico City policy , introduced in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, which bans the granting of U.S. funding to health providers internationally that discuss abortion as a family planning option. Since the Reagan administration, Democrats have rescinded the policy and Republicans have reinstated it. The latest president\u2019s memorandum directs the secretary of state to ensure that \u201cU.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\u201d Democrats have called the policy a \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d and have blasted the president for taking this action. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s reinstatement of the Global Gag Rule ignores decades of research, instead favoring ideological politics over women and families. We know that when family planning services and contraceptives are easily accessible, there are fewer unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths, and abortions,\u201d said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, in a statement. Withdrawing from TPP Mr. Trump issued a memorandum Monday that called on the U.S. Trade Representative to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and negotiations that began under President Obama. It was largely a symbolic move since Congress had no plans to approve the trade deal. \u201cI hereby direct you to withdraw the United States as a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to permanently withdraw the United States from TPP negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotiations to promote American industry, protect American workers, and raise American wages,\u201d the memorandum says. Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines On Tuesday, the president s igned memoranda that attempt to renew the process for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was halted by Mr. Obama, and the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. Uproar after Trump approves pipeline projects For the Keystone pipeline, the action invites TransCanada to \u201cre-submit\u201d an application for a presidential permit for the construction and operation of the pipeline that would carry petroleum from Canada into the U.S. The memorandum on the Dakota Access pipeline called it a \u201csubstantial, multi-billion-dollar private investment in our nation\u2019s energy infrastructure\u201d and would carry about 500,000 barrels of crude oil from different areas in North Dakota to oil markets in the U.S. The Army Corps of Engineers announced in December that it would explore an alternate route for the pipeline after the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said the pipeline interfered with their drinking water, which led to massive protests. Government-wide freeze on regulations White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said in a memo last Friday that he was communicating a request from the president to the heads of all government agencies that no new regulations could be submitted to the Federal Register until the head of a department or agency, selected by Mr. Trump, can review and approve the regulation. Any regulations that were already sent to the Federal Register must be immediately withdrawn for review and approval. For regulations that have been published in it, but haven\u2019t taken effect, their effective date must be postponed for 60 days to review them. \u201cExtreme vetting\u201d in immigration Mr. Trump signed an executive action calling for the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of new arrivals to the United States on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States,\u201d he told an audience at the Pentagon, where the action was signed.\u00a0 His order directs the State Department to stop issuing visas to Syrian nationals and halts the processing of Syrian refugees. That will remain in effect until he determines that enough security changes have been made to ensure that would-be terrorists can\u2019t exploit weaknesses in the current vetting system.\u00a0 The president, during his signing of the order at the Department of Homeland Security, also called on the Pentagon and the State Department to create a plan for safe zones in and around Syria to offer protection for Syrians fleeing the war there. But the signed order itself makes no mention of a plan for safe zones in Syria. A draft of the order had directed the Pentagon and the State Department to produce a plan for safe zones in the war-torn Mideast nation. Several other points included in the action: Mr. Trump ordered a 120-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which is America\u2019s broader refugee program. The suspension is intended to provide time to review how refugees are vetted before they are allowed to resettle in the United States. \u00a0 The executive action appears to be capping the number of refugees from other countries at 50,000 people in fiscal year 2017, saying more than that \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\u00a0 The action says that when U.S. Refugee Admissions Program admissions resume, the secretary of state, in consultation with the secretary of homeland security, is directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, \u201cto prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d Expanding the military Mr. Trump also signed an executive order on Friday that he said would result in \u201ca great rebuilding of the armed services of the United States.\u201d \u201cAs we prepare our budget request for Congress,\u201d he said, \u201c... our military strength will be questioned by no one,\u201d but neither will the nation\u2019s commitment to peace. \u00a0 \u201cWe will always have your back,\u201d he vowed to an audience at the Pentagon. According to Mr. Trump, the new action will provide new planes and ships for the military, along with resources and tools for the nation\u2019s men and women in uniform.\u00a0 The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Email An early-morning fire Saturday destroyed a Texas mosque that was a target of hatred several years ago and experienced a burglary just a week ago. A clerk at a convenience store spotted smoke and flames billowing from the Islamic Center of Victoria at around 2 a.m. and called the fire department. \"It's sad to stand there and watch it collapse down, and the fire was so huge,\" Shahid Hashmi, the Islamic center's president, said. \"It looks completely destroyed.\" Victoria Fire Marshal Tom Legler asked for help from the Texas Fire Marshal's Office and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine what caused the blaze. Hashmi said authorities have told him it was too early to speculate. \"None whatsoever right now,\" the center director said. \"We don't have any lead or information as to what started the fire and what happened. So I'm sure it's going to be a few days, they told us, before they can come up with any answers for us.\" The congregation's pastor, known as an imam, was awake in the early morning hours and checked online surveillance of the mosque and found no alarm active and the doors unlocked, Hashmi said. On Jan. 21, someone broke in and stole some electronics, including laptops. \"He was worried about it and drove over there,\" Hashmi said. \"By that time, fire engines were already there pouring water on the fire.\" The structure was built in 2000. No injuries were reported. It took about four hours to extinguish the blaze. Hashmi, who's lived in Victoria 32 years, said the congregation of about 140 has had few other problems and has enjoyed support from the city of about 115 miles southwest of Houston. He already has received offers of temporary quarters for the congregation to worship. \"When 9/11 happened, Muslims and non-Muslims, we all got together,\" he said. \"Of course, we will rebuild.\" The Victoria Advocate on Saturday reported ( http://bit.ly/2k388PZ ) that in July 2013, a man admitted to painting \"H8,\" a computer shorthand for \"hate,\" on the outside of the building. On Jan. 7, a mosque under construction near Lake Travis in Austin was burned to the ground. The Texas office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said like that blaze, it would monitor the investigation of the Victoria fire. \"Because of growing anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation, and because of the recent spike in hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions and individuals, we urge investigators to keep the possibility of a bias motive for this fire in mind,\" CAIR-Houston Executive Director Mustafaa Carroll said. There's been no determination yet for the Austin blaze, Diane Kanawati, with CAIR-Austin, said Saturday. In December, a man was sentenced to four years in prison for setting fire to a Houston mosque where he worshipped. Gary Nathaniel Moore pleaded guilty to arson and using a fire as a deadly weapon in a Dec. 25, 2015, blaze that caused significant damage at the Islamic Society of Greater Houston mosque. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Information from: The Victoria Advocate, http://www.victoriaadvocate.com 0 Shares ",

Hurt received Academy Award nominations for his work in Midnight Express in 1978 and David Lynch's The Elephant Man in 1980, but may be best remembered for his death-by-parasite-birth in Ridley Scott's Alien, a scene he comedically reprised several years later in Mel Brooks' Spaceballs.

Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images Updated at 6:47 p.m. ET President Trump's executive order on immigration is sending shockwaves across the U.S. and the globe. Just one day after he enacted a ban on the admittance of all refugees to the United States, temporarily freezing immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries, confusion, chaos are fear roiling at international airports. Refugees are being barred from boarding U.S.-bound flights. Immigrants are being detained at U.S. airports. Protests are rising up at JFK and Los Angeles airports. Thousands of leading academics have signed a petition denouncing Trump's actions . And top technology companies whose staff have been affected, are criticizing the move by the president. To cement the exigency of this move, on Saturday afternoon the State Department issued the following statement. \"Urgent Notice: Executive Order on Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals JANUARY 27, 2017 \u2014 (((Rep. Nadler))) (@RepJerryNadler) January 28, 2017 Urgent Notice Per the Executive Order on Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals signed on January 27, 2017, visa issuance to nationals of the countries of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen has been suspended effective immediately until further notification. If you are a citizen of one of these countries, please do not schedule a visa appointment or pay any visa fees at this time. If you already have an appointment scheduled, please DO NOT ATTEND. You will not be permitted entry to the Embassy/Consulate. We will announce any other changes affecting travelers to the United States as soon as that information is available.\" We've filed suit on behalf of Iraqis detained at JFK under Trump order. @ACLU @NILC_org Yale clinic @RefugeeAssist https://t.co/vp3Id2j8E0 \u2014 Cecillia Wang (@WangCecillia) January 28, 2017 Earlier in the day, several Iraqi refugees in Cairo, who had been cleared for resettlement in the U.S., were blocked from boarding their flight to New York City. And in Iraq, NPR's Jane Arraf reported that \"members of Yazidi minority, one of the biggest victims of ISIS, were prevented from boarding despite having visas.\" Article continues after sponsorship Green card holders \u2014 legal permanent residents of the U.S. \u2014 are also included in the ban, according to a senior Trump administration official. The official says they will need a case-by-case waiver in order to return to the U.S. if they are currently outside the country. Almost 200 Google employees affected NPR's Aarti Shahani told our Newscast that the CEOs of leading technology companies are taking a stand. Protesters rally outside Kennedy International Airport to protest Trump's executive order on Saturday. New York City officials and immigrant advocates are holding are also holding a vigil at the airport Saturday evening.

New York City officials and immigrant advocates are holding are also holding a vigil at the airport Saturday evening. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images \"Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to staff on Friday that the executive order affects at least 187 of his employees and that it's, quote, \"painful to see the personal cost\" of this move by the president. He said the company is \"upset\" about any immigration restrictions that prevent \"great talent\" from coming to the U.S. \"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a post on his facebook page that \"We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat.\" \"Travis Kalanick, chief of Uber, wrote in an email to his staff (and posted on Facebook) that about a dozen employees were affected, and that this ban will impact many innocent people. He said it's an issue he plans to raise this Friday \u2014 when he goes to Washington. He is part of President Trump's business advisory group.\" Detained at airports At major U.S. airports, NPR's Kirk Siegler reports international refugee assistance groups are sending attorneys and translators to support new arrivals who are being detained. I am an Iranian PhD student at Yale Uni. Now overseas to do research. Trump's EO might prevent me from returning to the US! #MuslimBan \u2014 Ali Abdi (@AliAbdi88) January 28, 2017 Two Iraqi men were held at Kennedy Airport in New York on Saturday. The ACLU and other legal organizations filed a writ of habeas corpus for the two men Saturday in an attempt to obtain their clients' release. Trump's Immigration Freeze Omits Those Linked To Deadly Attacks In U.S. One of those men, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was later released from detention on Saturday, U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler tweeted . Both Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi had been granted U.S. visas after the federal government \"deemed both Petitioners not to pose threats to the United States,\" the court filing reads. The filing says both men are being held at the airport by Customs and Border Protection \"solely pursuant to an executive order issued\" Friday. ACLU attorney Cecilia Wang tells NPR that Darweesh had arrived with his wife and child, but that he was held behind as his family was permitted to proceed. For his part, Alshawi's wife and child live in Houston with green cards, Wang says. Brandon Friedman, a U.S. Army veteran and former Obama administration official, explains to NPR's Scott Simon that Darweesh worked with him as a translator during his service in Iraq. Darweesh was \"approved for a special immigrant visa, given for his time and service to the U.S. government,\" Friedman says. Late Friday, Friedman began tweeting about his opposition to Trump's order, as well as a photo showing a pair of men he said helped his team and were \"no longer welcome in the U.S.\" \"Hameed was one of the first people to sign up to work with us. He helped interpret, he hooked us up with things that we needed and helped us generally get through the communities that we were operating in in Iraq,\" Friedman tells Simon. \"And he put his life on the line. He risked his family's life to do that.\" In a joint statement , Reps. Nadler and Nydia Velazquez say they are continuing to work for the release of 11 other people still held at the airport in New York. News of both sets of detainments follows on the heels of Trump's Friday order, which also halted all refugee admission to the U.S. Trump's freeze on immigration applies not only to people from Iraq and Yemen, but also Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Sudan. \"Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter our country,\" the executive order reads. Order shuts door to all refugees NPR's Scott Horsley explains further: \"The order shuts the door to all refugees for four months and suspends entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely. It shrinks the overall refugee program by more than half. Trump told a Christian broadcaster that preference will be given to Christian refugees from the Middle East.\" Colleges and universities around the U.S. have been advising students from the seven listed countries \u2014 including lawful permanent residents \u2014 not to leave the U.S. until there is further clarity on the new rules. Students at Princeton , Stanford and Chapman University , among others. reported letters from their respective schools recommending caution. The Chronicle of Higher Education noted one Iranian student in Yale's Ph.D. program who says he may be stranded after leaving the U.S. for a research trip. As NPR's Greg Myre reports , Trump's executive order \"doesn't include any countries from which radicalized Muslims have actually killed Americans in the U.S. since Sept. 11, 2001.\" Greg notes that the countries of origin of radicalized Muslims who have killed Americans on U.S. soil, beginning on Sept. 11, are instead Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Russia, United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.

After a hectic first week in the White House, Trump took calls privately from the Oval Office. The day of diplomacy included cordial congratulations given to the new leader of the free world, as well as serious discussions about some of the world's most pressing issues. President Donald Trump speaks on the phone with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel from the Oval Office of the White House on Jan. 28, 2017. Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images While Trump took the calls, he began getting push back from Democrats and human rights groups angered over his executive order closing the nation's borders to U.S. legal permanent residents and visa-holders from certain Muslim-majority countries. His day also included the introduction of more executive orders. Trump has been juggling discussions with foreign leaders this week, just nine days into his unorthodox presidency. He hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May at the White House on Friday and earlier tried to smooth over tensions with another U.S. ally, Mexico, whose president bristled at Trump's rhetoric surrounding the building of a border wall. The phone calls with foreign leaders Saturday included: Russian President Vladimir Putin Trump's most anticipated conversation was with Putin, whose country is accused of engaging in cyberattacks to influence the recent U.S. election. The approximately hour-long call was described as \"positive\" and \"a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,\" The White House said in a statement. The White House said the pair discussed a number of international issues from fighting terrorism to the conflict in Syria. They also discussed the crisis in the Ukraine, the Kremlin said on its website. \"Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today's call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern,\" the White House said. Putin and Trump agreed to work on stabilizing U.S.-Russian relations, which became strained under the Obama administration, the Kremlin said. Putin congratulated Trump and wished him success, the White House said. The leaders also said they would \"maintain regular personal contacts,\" the Kremlin added, and would work out a date to meet face-to-face. According to White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Trump took the call while he was with some of his top advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and chief of staff Reince Priebus.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel The call between Trump and Merkel lasted about 45 minutes, according to Spicer, and covered a slate of international affairs, including Russia and Ukraine, the Middle East and North Africa. The conversation also centered around keeping NATO strong and having a stable transatlantic relationship, the White House said. . @POTUS speaks with German Chancellor Merkel from the Oval Office.  One of five heads of government calls today pic.twitter.com/xMNl3A3Iw0 \u2014 Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 28, 2017 Trump last year called for NATO members to pay their fair financial burden as part of the alliance, and suggested the U.S. otherwise might not step in to defend members under attack in the Baltic \u2014 setting off concern among the international community. Trump and Merkel discussed how NATO thrives with all allies \"contributing their fair share to our collective security,\" the White House said. The pair's discussion likely required more diplomatic savvy after Trump spent his presidential campaign both slamming Merkel for \"ruining Germany\" over her immigration stances and calling her as his favorite world leader at one point. Trump on Saturday agreed to attend the G-20 Summit in Germany in July, and said he would invite the chancellor to Washington. Also in the room during the call were Bannon and Priebus. French President Francois Hollande Hollande was more pointed in his first official phone conversation with Trump. He warned the real estate mogul-turned-politician against taking a protectionist approach in the U.S., which could have economic and political consequences, a statement from the French president's office said. \"In an unstable and uncertain world, turning inward would be a dead-end,\" Hollande told Trump, according to the statement. Hollande announced last month he will not run for re-election this year after a first-term undermined by high unemployment and the rise of French nationalism. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Trump spoke with Abe about maintaining the U.S.-Japanese alliance and affirmed America's \"ironclad\" commitment to ensuring the security of Japan, the White House said in a statement. Among the other topics discussed were newly sworn-in Defense Secretary James Mattis ' upcoming trip to Asia, including Japan, as well as continued cooperation on handling North Korea and deepening bilateral trade. The White House did not detail whether Trump and Abe discussed the auto industry, which has been regularly admonished by the president. Japanese officials in recent weeks have expressed frustration over the attacks, including Trump's rebuke of U.S. automakers that build cars in lower-cost foreign factories. Trump and Abe agreed to meet at the White House on Feb. 10, Spicer said. Erik Ortiz ",

And, as Betty White has often showed, it's fun to watch a stuffy old authority figure act out in a silly modern way. Lauren Naturale, the dictionary's Content and Social Media Manager told NBC News that the \"response was overwhelmingly positive\" to the tweets, adding they are \"among the most viral tweets we've ever had.\" \"A number of people actually told us they were subscribing to our Unabridged dictionary, or getting our app, or running out to buy a physical book,\" Naturale said. Indeed, the public reaction has been \"big league,\" as the president might say. (Or is it \"bigly?\" Merriam-Webster found \"examples of big league as a figurative adjective from 1916. The adverbial use of big league favored by Trump is not often encountered, however.\") Related: In Trump's Twitter Presidency, Experts See Risks and Rewards The dictionary saw its Twitter followers surge to more than 260,000 during last year's election. And while it never engages directly with Trump or his aides, Merriam-Webster's cheeky subtweets regularly get tens of thousands of shares and attention from mainstream media outlets. ( Urban Dictionary \u2014 somewhat of an unruly cousin \u2014 defines \"subtweet\" as \"talking about someone behind their back but sort of in their face on Twitter.\" Merriam-Webster doesn't have a definition for the slang term, yet.) Dictionaries were early adopters of the Internet in the 1990s, recognizing its utility as a teaching tool. And Merriam-Webster, which traces its roots to Colonial-era American lexicographer Noah Webster, and has been reporting on trending words since 2010. \"Reporting on lookup trends completes the circle of telling the truth about words for us, because we have always used evidence of a word's use in order to write definitions,\" said Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large for Merriam-Webster. \"We don't comment on policy or politics, but when a public figure uses language in a remarkable way that makes the news, it's fair game for us.\" Related: Poll: Nearly 70 Percent of Americans Give a Thumbs Down to Trump's Twitter Habit Merriam-Webster's 2016 word of the year was \" surreal .\" Language has always been political, and it's possible the dictionary could join other elite institutions if Trump fans begin to see its definitions as compromised. George Orwell, another classroom favorite, whose \"1984\" has suddenly become a bestseller, described the \"special connection between politics and the debasement of language.\" Play ",

(Frederic de la Mure/French Foreign Ministry via AP) 0 Shares Email Anger erupted on Saturday \u2014 along with some praise from the far-right \u2014 about U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees entering the United States. The French president vigorously urged European leaders to present a united front against populism while the German foreign minister noted that \"love thy neighbor\" is a key part of America's Christian traditions. Turkey's prime minister insisted that \"you cannot settle this issue by building walls.\" In Israel, meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greeted Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border as a \"great idea.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS HOLLANDE \"Europe is facing a moment of truth. The issue is populism. What we are hearing from the U.S. encourages populism and even extremism. They are saying that Europe should not take immigrants, shouldn't stay together, not believe in climate change . \"We should engage in discussions (with the U.S.) that sometimes should be very firm. And as long as there are statements from the U.S. president about Europe, when he speaks about the model of Brexit for other countries, when the U.S. president talks about climate change ... saying he's not convinced of it, we should respond to him. When he takes protectionist measures, we should respond to him. When he destabilizes the economies of other countries, not only European ones, we should respond to him. When he rejects the arrival of refugees, while Europe has done its duty, we should respond to him.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 TURKISH PRIME MINISTER BINALI YILDIRIM \"You cannot settle this (refugee) issue by building walls. Nobody leaves their homes for nothing.\" Turkey has admitted some 3 million Syrian refugees since the start of the war in its neighbor. \"They came here to save their lives and our doors were open.

The president's call with Putin on Saturday afternoon came a day after Trump said in a press conference that it was too \"early\" to decide whether to remove U.S. sanctions against Russia, though he also said, as he has previously, that it would be beneficial for the U.S. and Russia to have a friendlier relationship. Trump faces pressure from within his own party against lifting the sanctions. According to a readout from the Kremlin after Saturday's call, Trump and Putin's conversation \"underlined the importance of restoring mutually profitable trade and economic connections between the business circles of the two countries.\" The Kremlin also said Trump and Putin discussed many international issues, including the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, nuclear non-proliferation, the Iran nuclear program and North Korea. It says they also discussed the Ukraine crisis. \u201cBoth sides demonstrated a disposition towards active joint work for the stabilization and development of Russian-American collaboration on a constructive, equal and mutually beneficial basis,\" the Kremlin said. The Kremlin further indicated that the two leaders agreed on a need to \u201cunify efforts\u201d against the \u201cdestruction of ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria.\u201d Trump has repeatedly suggested the possibility of partnering with Putin in Syria, although this has sparked concern among both Democrats and Republicans due to Russia's support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's attacks against civilians in that country's civil war. The president's phone conversations with foreign leaders follow a week of dramatic action by his new administration, mostly initiated through executive orders that have sent signals both at home and abroad that the new president aims to make dramatic changes to longstanding U.S. policies. A prime example is the executive order putting an indefinite halt to the Syrian refugee program, along with a four-month suspension of all refugees being admitted to the U.S. That order is sure to cause rifts in the relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , whose country has borne the brunt of the refugee crisis in the Middle East. Trump has in the past publicly criticized Merkel's decision to welcome refugees as an \"open borders\" policy that invites the potential for terrorism . ",

(Bryan R. Smith / AFP/Getty Images) Thousand of New Yorkers headed out to John F. Kennedy airport Saturday evening to protest President Trump\u2019s new executive order turning back refugees and other visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Word of the spontaneous demonstration was spread across social media, with activists like filmmaker Michael Moore calling out \u201cEverybody in NYC area--- head to JFK Terminal 4 NOW.\u201d\u00a0 By late afternoon, it appeared that more than 2,000 had heeded the call to protest, to the dismay of airport security struggling to keep the terminal clear for travelers.

    "text": "CBS News Jan 28, 2017 3:47 PM EST After widespread confusion about who will be affected by President Trump\u2019s recently signed executive order pausing travel to the U.S. from citizens of selected Muslim majority countries, officials are scrambling to clarify the policy. Senior administration officials told CBS News Saturday that for permanent American residents -- those holding green cards -- from the listed countries, their readmittance to the U.S. will be done on a \u201ccase by case exemption process.\u201d The countries which have majority Muslim populations and will be affected by the 90-day moratorium on travel to the U.S. include Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. Iraqi refugee freed after being detained at JFK airport According to one administration official, for those people who are currently overseas and want to re-enter the U.S., they will be processed by the same waiver process that addressed, for example, the individuals detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport Saturday . Of that incident, which involved Iraqi immigrant Hameed Darweesh, the official said it \u201cdemonstrates that the exemptions and waivers process that we put into place is already working exactly as intended.\u201d (Darweesh, who had been issued a visa to the country, was freed after two U.S. lawmakers -- Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats of New York -- appeared at the airport asking about his detention.) Those who have dual citizenship with the seven countries will also be stopped from stepping foot in the U.S., according to a Wall Street Journal report, which cites a State Department statement due to be released. An administration official insisted to CBS News that the executive order is \u201cnot a travel ban\u201d but is instead a \u201ccessation of most travel with case-by-case exemptions.\u201d The official said that the departments of State and Homeland Security were still in the process of finalizing the next round of guidance for the executive order. Despite White House claims that the actions do not constitute a travel ban, however, some airlines have already begun turning away would-be passengers to the U.S.\u00a0 For example, on Saturday, Dutch airline KLM confirmed to CBS News that it has already had to turn away at least seven travelers because of the executive order. CBS News\u2019 Alicia Amling, Steven Portnoy, and Reena Ninan contributed to this report.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

The lawsuit by the student, who is listed in the documents only as \"Elizabeth Doe,\" alleges at least 52 rapes by more than 30 football players over a four-year period. It also alleges a \"culture of sexual violence\" and describes her 2013 attack by two players. It doesn't detail the other alleged attacks, but says some were recorded by the players, who shared them with friends. Related: Three More Women Sue Baylor U. Over Handling of Rape Allegations Fifty-two assaults would dramatically increase the 17 reports of sexual and physical attacks involving 19 players since 2011 previously acknowledged by Baylor officials. The school faces at least five lawsuits from women who allege they were attacked and that the school failed to protect them or ignored their complaints. The nation's largest Baptist university has been gripped by the on-going scandal that led to the firing of football coach Art Briles and the departure of school President Ken Starr in 2016. An internal investigation last year found that the football program operated as if it was \"above the rules\" and that assistant coaches and staff interfered or stifled investigations into alleged assaults by players. Baylor allowed Briles' staff of assistants to remain for the 2016 season but new coach Matt Rhule hasn't retained them. Some have moved to new jobs, including Briles' son and former offensive coordinator, Kendal Briles, to Florida Atlantic, and defensive coordinator Phil Bennett to Arizona State. Related: Ken Starr, Bill Clinton Nemesis, Ousted as Baylor President Amid School Scandal In a statement, Baylor President David E. Garland said the university had made \"great progress\" in fortifying security measures since the sexual assault scandal erupted last year. \"Baylor University has taken unprecedented actions that have been well-documented in response to the issue of past and alleged sexual assaults involving our campus community,\" Garland said. \"We have made great progress in implementing 105 recommendations to strengthen the safety and security of all students and restore faith in the university.\" The statement did not specifically address the allegations in the new lawsuit. In the lawsuit filed Friday, the woman alleges being raped by two players in 2013. The attack was reported to Waco police but no charges were filed and the players were allowed to stay on the team at the time. Related: Ken Starr Resigns as Baylor Chancellor in Wake of Sex-Assault Case Controversy According to the lawsuit, campus officials didn't investigate her case until 2015. One of the players involved was suspended from the team and later expelled. The other had transferred. The lawsuit alleges the football program operated under a \"show'em a good time\" policy that \"used sex to sell\" Baylor to high school recruits. The woman was a member of a campus group called the Baylor Bruins that would host prospective athletes during visits. The lawsuit alleges Baylor encouraged making Baylor Bruins available for sex with recruits, as well as taking recruits to strip clubs, implied promises of sex and using alcohol and drugs in the recruiting process. Art Briles' attorney Ernest Cannon denied the program culture described in the lawsuit. \"If they were doing that it would be terrible, but they weren't doing that. Art wasn't involved in anything like that,\" Cannon said. \"Lawyers have great imaginations when money is involved. It's really sad.\" Associated Press ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story But for students of Mr. Trump\u2019s long business career, there was much about President Trump\u2019s truth-mangling ways that was familiar: the mystifying false statements about seemingly trivial details, the rewriting of history to airbrush unwanted facts, the branding as liars those who point out his untruths, the deft conversion of demonstrably false claims into a semantic mush of unverifiable \u201cbeliefs.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump\u2019s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for deep-seated insecurities. But throughout his business career, Mr. Trump\u2019s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump\u2019s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his self-proclaimed image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand. Nearly 30 years ago, in his best-selling book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Mr. Trump memorably extolled the advantages of \u201ctruthful hyperbole,\u201d which he described as \u201can innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion.\u201d It is one thing when the hyperbole comes from a reality TV star exaggerating his ratings to a roomful of television critics. The stakes are infinitely higher when it comes from the leader of the free world, and this reality is provoking alarm from many across the political spectrum. Steve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said in an interview that Mr. Trump\u2019s cascade of falsehoods was \u201ca direct assault on the very idea of representative democracy\u201d in the United States. Mr. Schmidt said that when he heard Mr. Trump\u2019s adviser Kellyanne Conway defend the Trump administration\u2019s \u201calternative facts\u201d on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last Sunday, he thought of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d in which the Ministry of Truth is emblazoned with three slogans: \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d \u201cIn a democratic government, there must be truth in order to hold elected officials accountable to their sovereign, which is the people,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cAll authoritarian societies are built on a foundation of lies and alternative facts, and what is true is what the leader believes, or what is best for the state.\u201d Mr. Lewis argued that the president\u2019s untruths were a deliberate strategy to position the nation\u2019s leading news organizations as the enemy of his administration. \u201cFact-checking becomes an act of war by the media,\u201d he said. Indeed, last Saturday, on Day 2 of his administration, Mr. Trump told hundreds of C.I.A. employees that he had \u201ca running war with the media\u201d and called journalists \u201camong the most dishonest human beings on earth.\u201d The next day, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, accused the news media of trying to \u201cdelegitimize\u201d the new president and promised, \u201cWe are not going to sit around and let it happen.\u201d By Wednesday, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief White House strategist, was referring to the news media as \u201cthe opposition party\u201d during an interview with The New York Times. \u201cIt feels like this was part of the plan all along,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. Photo Stephen K. Bannon, center, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief White House strategist, and Reince Priebus, his chief of staff, in Washington on the morning of the inauguration. On Wednesday, Mr. Bannon told The New York Times that the news media was \u201cthe opposition party.\u201d Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Doris Kearns Goodwin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who has written about Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, said in an interview that Mr. Trump\u2019s brazen willingness to deny \u201cobjective reality\u201d had, if nothing else, succeeded in diverting public attention from matters of more lasting consequence, like his flurry of executive orders. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he is doing it strategically,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it certainly had the impact of a magician\u2019s sleight of hand.\u201d Deception, dissembling, exaggeration \u2014 what Fortune magazine called his \u201castonishing ability to prevaricate\u201d \u2014 has deep roots in Mr. Trump\u2019s business career. In innumerable interviews over the years, Mr. Trump glibly inflated everything from the size of his speaking fees to the cost of his golf club memberships to the number of units he had sold in new Trump buildings. In project after project, he faced allegations of broken promises, deceit or outright fraud, from Trump University students who said they had been defrauded , to Trump condominium buyers who said they had been fleeced, to small-time contractors who said Mr. Trump had fabricated complaints about their work to avoid paying them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the early 1980s, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had filed a \u201cspurious\u201d lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. In the early 1990s, a federal judge ruled that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s denials, there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d he and his subordinates had conspired to hire undocumented workers and deprive them of employment benefits. In the case of Trump University, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that he had \u201chandpicked\u201d each of the instructors who were hired to teach students the secrets of his real estate investing strategies. Yet during a deposition, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single instructor, even after he was shown their photographs. The price Mr. Trump paid for this record of prevarication was modest and manageable. His lawyers quietly settled cases when necessary, almost always after binding plaintiffs to secrecy. Some major banks and law firms quietly pulled back from doing or seeking business with the Trump Organization. Skeptical judges turned away his libel suit against a journalist who wrote a book calling into question the amount of his wealth. But usually, by the time the truth caught up, Mr. Trump had moved on to the next big thing. Once he stepped into the political arena, however, fact-checking operations began cataloging his false statements in ways he never experienced during his years as a real estate developer and reality television star. PolitiFact, for example, has scrutinized 356 specific claims by Mr. Trump and found that more than two-thirds of the claims were \u201cmostly false,\u201d \u201cfalse\u201d or, in 62 cases, \u201cPants on Fire\u201d false. Video President Trump\u2019s First Actions In his first week in office, President Trump canceled the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, promised to make his proposed border wall a reality, began to roll back the Affordable Care Act, and more. By DAVE HORN and SHANE O\u2019NEILL on Publish Date January 26, 2017. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed \u201cTrump is a different kind of figure than we\u2019ve ever seen before in our 10 years of fact-checking,\u201d Bill Adair, the creator of PolitiFact and a journalism professor at Duke University, said in an interview. \u201cNo one has come close to Trump in the high percentage of falsehoods.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s election alone is evidence he did not pay a high price for his plethora of false claims on the campaign trail. Nor are there many signs that his loyal base of supporters is troubled by the misstatements he has made in the first week of his presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the messages and the actions of the first week are deeply resonating with tens of millions of Americans,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. And even if some Republican leaders in Washington view the president\u2019s behavior as \u201cstrange\u201d or \u201cworrisome,\u201d he said, they are for now more focused on the tax cuts and deregulation they hope to achieve under his administration. Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about whether he understands the difference between fallacies uttered by the president of the United States and promotional puffery from a real estate developer boasting of his latest hotel or golf course. In Mr. Trump\u2019s first interview as president , David Muir of ABC News asked, \u201cDo you think that your words matter more now?\u201d \u201cYes, very much,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Yet then Mr. Muir asked, \u201cDo you think that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country without presenting the evidence?\u201d Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

(Photo: Keldy Ortiz/NorthJersey.com) Protests\u00a0erupted at area airports Saturday as Americans reacted in outrage\u00a0to President Trump's\u00a0sweeping order that banned people\u00a0from seven Muslim-majority countries\u00a0from entering the U.S. and suspended the nation's refugee program \u2013\u00a0an order than many assailed as un-American and discriminatory. Over 1,000 people gathered at John F. Kennedy International Airport\u00a0in New York and more than 120 at Newark Liberty International Airport clutching signs denouncing the executive order, alongside lawyers who rushed to airports to defend the rights of refugees, immigrants and green-card holders, among others, who were being detained and denied entry. \"This banning of people based on religion is not constitutional and it's not what we are about,\" said\u00a0Yamandou Alexander of Jersey City, who hurried to Newark airport when he found out about the demonstration. Alexander, a U.S. citizen who was born in France and who is Muslim, said he couldn't stay away. At the airport, attorneys stood by to help those in need. Attorney David A. Isaacson, who practices primarily immigration law in New York, said he learned of a\u00a0Syrian citizen with a green card who arrived from Germany at around 4 p.m. was still begin questioned two hours later, as his daughter waited for him to be released. A Rutgers Ph.d student who went to visit her ill mother in Syria and was on her way back also was having problems getting back into the country,\u00a0said Attorney Ayanna Lewis-Gruss. She said the students host family reached out to attorneys at the airport after the woman was stopped on\u00a0a layover in Paris and was not allowed to fly to Newark. \u2014 Keldy Ortiz (@KeldyOrtiz) January 28, 2017 The protests on Saturday were organized\u00a0spontaneously and grew throughout the day as news spread about the far-reaching impact of Trump's order.\u00a0There were reports\u00a0about\u00a0legal residents\u00a0detained at borders, stranded in other countries and in some cases deported. At the same time,\u00a0refugees who had gone through years-long approvals to come to the U.S. were also being barred. As word spread, protests were organized too in other cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco. Protesters at John F. Kennedy International Airport Saturday Jan. 28, 2017. \u00a0(Photo: Keldy Ortiz/NorthJersey.com) At JFK Airport, the crowd grew to more than 1,000 people by Saturday evening as word spread of the protest. \"I was in disbelief. I just had to jump in my car and head out here,\"\u00a0said Hillary Frileck, of Brooklyn. \"This is what really scares me. This resonates with me. One person (who was detained) works for us. These people have visas. It's important for us to speak up. We have to rise up. We can't just lay on our couches and think things will be okay.\" Emily Witt, of Brooklyn, said she viewed that the ban was a \"bad moral decision\" especially\u00a0given that it was Holocaust Remembrance Day.

As he signed each one, he gave a brief description of their contents with top aides surrounding him. Vice President Mike Pence, along with chief of staff Reince Preibus, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland, chief White House strategist Steve Bannon and top aide Kellyanne Conway were all present.\u00a0 Of the lobbying ban, which will restrict how government officials take jobs with lobbying firms after their stint in the public service, Mr. Trump called it a \u201cfive-year\u201d rule.\u00a0 \u201cMost of the people standing behind me will not be able to go to work,\u201d the president joked.\u00a0 On the memorandum outlining a plan to defeat ISIS, Mr. Trump predicted that \u201cit\u2019s going to be very successful.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s big stuff,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump also put pen to paper for a memo on reorganizing the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council. \u201cIt represents a lot -- and also a lot of efficiency and I think a lot of additional safety,\u201d he said of the memo. The president answered two brief questions about the immigration order he signed Friday, saying that his administration was \u201ctotally\u201d prepared to implement the directive.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\u201d Mr. Trump said, presumably referencing reports of multiple detentions of travelers at airports around the country. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban, and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\u201d \u00a0 Despite the targeting of Muslim majority countries and the priority the president said he would give to processing Christian refugee applications, Mr. Trump denied that the order was a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Photo: Olivier Douliery / POOL, EPA) The future of President Trump's executive order suspending immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries may come down to a legal battle between his powers as commander in chief and discrimination limitations\u00a0established by Congress. Lawyers and protesters spent most of the day Saturday focused on immigrants who were traveling when Trump's order was issued, leaving them either detained at U.S. airports or stranded overseas. But the legality of Trump's order will not be clear until it's argued in federal court, which could happen as early as next week, when civil rights and immigration advocacy groups begin filing their lawsuits. Supporters of Trump's plan say he is standing on firm legal ground to ban\u00a0immigrants\u00a0and refugees temporarily from those countries because they pose a national security threat. Trump's order opens by citing the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and explains that the immigration suspension is necessary to give the federal government time to strengthen its vetting procedures for people coming from terror-prone countries. \"Throughout the history of this country, courts have given, for obvious reasons, the executive extraordinary latitude in making determinations associated with national security,\"\u00a0said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates for lower levels of legal and illegal immigration. \"And this is a national security judgement, something that courts would never want to interfere with.\" CLOSE x Share Sara Flounders from Jersey City at the Union Square subway station en route to JFK protests. Rick Green/NorthJersey.com More coverage:\u00a0 A Syrian and his American wife are stuck in Iraq because of Trump's ban Critics of Trump's plan say his national security argument is undercut by his repeated calls on the campaign trail for a \"Muslim ban\" and his comments Friday that he wants to prioritize the immigration of persecuted Christians over Muslims. Trump's ban also applies to everyone from Syria. David Leopold, a Cleveland immigration attorney and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said a president clearly has a right to bar certain immigrants or groups of immigrants from entering the U.S. Trump's order cited a long-standing federal law that allows a president to bar entry to any immigrants or group of immigrants who the president deems\u00a0\"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" \"But what the Trump administration failed to do,\" Leopold said, \"is understand that nothing in our law justifies banning an entire religion, banning an entire nationality. He's going to have to answer how he can say that all of Syria is detrimental.\" Leopold's argument rests largely on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which forbids discrimination against immigrants based on their \"nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.\" The U.S. had previously used an immigration system that set a limit on the number of people who could enter the U.S. from each country, a system that heavily favored immigration from western Europe. U.S. immigrants react to ban: 'Our president is trying to divide us' But that law has been set aside by presidents during national emergencies, according to\u00a0Michael Hethmon, senior counsel at the Immigration Reform Law Institute, which provides legal support to legislators and politicians who want to reduce immigration. Hethmon uses the example of President Carter, who in 1980 barred some Iranians from entering the U.S. during a crisis over 52\u00a0Americans being held hostage in Tehran. He said that case mirrors what Trump is facing now \u2014\u00a0the United States facing a large number\u00a0of people in specific countries who are trying to harm the U.S. \"The court will say, 'There's a rational basis for picking these seven countries,'\" Hethmon said. \"They're all in the midst of civil conflict, they're all places where terrorist networks that are particularly dangerous to the U.S. exists. There are multiple reasons why refugees from these countries merit additional, or even extensive, scrutiny.\" The seven are Iran, Sudan and Syria \u2014 which comprise the State Department\u2019s\u00a0list of state sponsors of terrorism \u2014 plus Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The key for a court to understand the true intent behind Trump's order \u2014\u00a0whether it's a religious ban or a national security concern \u2014\u00a0could lie in one paragraph of his executive order. It\u00a0declares that once the refugee program is reinstated, the Department of Homeland Security must prioritize refugee claims made by persecuted religious minorities. \"Whoever drafted the order, I think they thought they were being incredibly clever immunizing this from legal scrutiny,\" said\u00a0Jens David Ohlin, an international law professor at Cornell Law School. \"But they might have shot themselves in the foot with that one.\" Ohlin said that one section, which he said was the only piece of the order that did not pin itself to the national security argument, may open the entire order to questions about favoring one religion over another. It also follows comments Trump made to the Christian Broadcast Service on Friday, when he\u00a0said Christians had been treated unfairly under the U.S. refugee program and they needed to be prioritized in the future. \"Courts are going to be giving really serious scrutiny to that one,\" Ohlin said. As legal questions continue to swirl over Trump's order, only one certainty exists. \"This is the start of a wave of litigation,\" said\u00a0Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project.

It's possible that immigration officials saw the tide turning and preemptively applied polices they were anticipating, the official said. Individuals stopped at immigration were told they have the option of returning to their country voluntarily or face criminal penalties for violating U.S. law, said another federal official. No other explanation was given as it is not legally required, the official said. \"To slap an expedited removal without any question and answer is odd,\" said Leslie Holman, an immigration attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"It seems improper.\" In addition to the visa revocation and expedited removal, several individuals were hit with a five-year ban, barring them from re-entering the country, including those who left voluntarily, the official confirmed. People leave voluntarily in order to avoid a ban, but it was put on them anyway, the official said. \"Essentially all valid visas are irrelevant now,\" the official said. \"And they have been before the order.\" The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return a request for comment. A State Department spokesperson said the department was prohibited from commenting on individual visa cases. The American Association of Immigration Lawyers also advised caution. In a statement released one day before Trump's executive order, the group said to \"consider advising clients who might be affected by the Executive Order to refrain from traveling outside of the United States if they are already here, or try to return to the United States as soon as possible if they are outside of the country.\" Since Trump's order does not define what it means to be \"from a country,\" the order should be read to include \"passport holders, citizens, nationals, dual nationals, etc.\" \"in an abundance of caution,\" the statement added.

By Brian Fung and Tracy Jan By Brian Fung and Tracy Jan January 28 at 6:10 PM Follow @b_fung Follow @TracyJan (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) The country\u2019s leading technology companies are recalling overseas employees and sharply criticizing President Trump after he signed an executive order Friday barring for 90 days immigrants and visitors from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States. The companies warned the action \u2014 which\u00a0affects foreign-born immigrants with legal permanent residence status in the United States and also includes suspending the acceptance of refu\u00adgees for 120 days \u2014 could impair the ability of America\u2019s top companies to compete. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai late on Friday\u00a0ordered scores of staffers\u00a0traveling overseas to return to the United States immediately. Pichai\u00a0sent out\u00a0a company-wide memo that was highly critical of Trump's action, saying it\u00a0could prevent at least 187\u00a0foreign-born Google\u00a0employees from entering the United States. \u201cIt's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\" wrote Pichai. \"We\u2019re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US.\" Thousands of tech workers living in Silicon Valley or abroad could potentially be impacted by Trump's executive order, according to\u00a0Zahra Billoo, executive director of the San Francisco Bay Area office of Council on American-Islamic Relations. About 250,000 Muslims are estimated to live in the Bay Area, many of whom are Arab or South Asian immigrants working at companies such as\u00a0Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft. Green card holders are at risk as well. \u201cThis is just where it starts. What happens when they add Pakistan? Or a Gulf country? Indonesia and Malaysia?\u201d said Billoo, a civil rights attorney. \u201cBy targeting immigrants in this way, Trump\u2019s executive orders not only directly impacts certain workers, their families and these companies, they also impact co-workers because people from other Muslim-majority countries could be next.\u201d Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said in a tweet that the economic impact of the ban is \"real and upsetting.\" The policy won't just affect tech employees; it could also harm thousands of part-time drivers for ride-hailing services relied upon by many Americans, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick said in a company-wide email. Kalanick added that he will be sure to raise the issue on Friday when he and a slew of other business advisers are expected to meet with Trump. \"This ban will impact many innocent people,\" wrote Kalanick, who in December accepted a position on Trump's economic advisory team. In addition to blocking travelers\u00a0from\u00a0Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen, the restrictions on foreign entry will also apply to those who hold dual nationality. That would mean a person born in one of those seven countries but holding a passport from a\u00a0country such as Britain, could also be denied entry into the United States. Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith, in a letter to staff Saturday, said that at least 76 employees will be affected by Trump's policy. The company said it has already\u00a0contacted those individuals\u00a0with offers of legal assistance and has urged other employees\u00a0who may be subject to the ban to contact the company as soon as possible. \"As an immigrant and as a CEO, I\u2019ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,\"\u00a0wrote Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, in a LinkedIn post . \"We will continue to advocate on this important topic.\" Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on Friday wrote in a public message that both he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are indebted to the United States' policy of welcomeness and inclusion. \"We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That's who we are,\" wrote Zuckerberg. \"Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla's family wouldn't be here today.\" Similar sentiments were expressed\u00a0across the tech industry. Apple chief executive Tim Cook, who was in Washington to meet with Republican officials, tweeted a historic quote from President Abraham Lincoln highlighting \"malice toward none\" and \"charity for all\" during a visit to Ford's Theatre. Deeply moved today visiting @FordsTheatreNPS and Peterson House where Abraham Lincoln took his last breath. His words are timeless. pic.twitter.com/z6mMAvOdzK \u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) January 28, 2017 Cook later said in a company-wide email that without immigration, Apple would not exist; the co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, was the son of a Syrian immigrant . \"I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries,\" Cook wrote. \"I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support.\" Meanwhile, a major trade group representing firms such as Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft and LinkedIn said Saturday that Trump's decision had \"troubling consequences\" for Silicon Valley companies who depend on talent from overseas. \"The internet industry is deeply concerned with the implications of President Trump's executive order limiting immigration and movement into the United States,\" said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association. Open doors brings all of US together. Closing doors further divides US. Let's all find ways to connect people, not separate them. \u2014 Brian Chesky (@bchesky) January 28, 2017 Trump's hostility toward Muslim refugees and immigrants raises tensions between the White House and Silicon Valley. Aside from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who has been closely advising Trump, much of the tech industry had supported Hillary Clinton for president. In open letters and other public statements during the campaign, tech execs and workers objected to Trump's anti-Muslim views, and some signed onto a commitment not to help design Trump's proposed Muslim registry. Trump's\u00a0action against\u00a0Middle Eastern travelers obligates\u00a0tech companies to take a stand, Sam Altman, president of the influential\u00a0startup accelerator Y Combinator, said in a blog post Saturday. \"The precedent of invalidating already-issued visas and green cards should be extremely troubling for immigrants of any country or for anyone who thinks their contributions to the US are important,\" Altman said in the post. \"This is not just a Muslim ban. This is a breach of America's contract with all the immigrants in the nation.\" For many in Silicon Valley, Trump's order crossed \"a red line,\" according to Hunter Walk, a partner at the San Francisco-based venture capital firm Homebrew VC. \"For those of us who've already been vocal ... [it's] moving people from saying 'focus on midterm elections' to apply direct pressure to our industry's CEOs and our politicians to take a stand,\" said Walk. \"And for those in our industry who thought they could just wait and see, they're taking our administration both literally and seriously this morning.\" business ",

Got it President Trump, accompanied by Vice President Pence, shakes hands with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Thursday at a congressional retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday. (Matt Rourke/AP) By Kelsey Snell , Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis By Kelsey Snell , Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis January 28 at 5:27 PM Follow @kelsey_snell Follow @karoun Follow @mikedebonis Several congressional Republicans on Saturday questioned President Trump\u2019s order to halt admission to the U.S. by refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, even as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) continued to defend it. Ryan was among the first lawmakers on Friday to back Trump\u2019s order, and his office reiterated his support on Saturday. \u201cThis is not a religious test and it is not a ban on people of any religion,\u201d said spokeswoman AshLee Strong. The order blocks citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya from entering the country for at least 90 days. It also bans refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days \u2014 and from Syria indefinitely. Trump said that the goal is to screen out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d and that priority for admission would be given to Christians. [ Trump signs order temporarily halting admission of refugees, promises priority for Christians ] (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Republicans defending the executive order did so pointed to an exception for people already in transit and argued that some elements, including the religious minority preference, would not immediately be implemented. But as cable news footage brought scenes all day Saturday of chaos at airports around the country, where business travelers, students and even legal U.S. residents were being barred entry, other Republicans began weighing in. \u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.). \u201cI guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration. You know, there are many, many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for many innocent, vulnerable people around the world.\u201d Dent, who represents a large Syrian community in the Allentown area, said he was contacted Saturday by a constituent who had family members turned away early in the morning at Philadelphia International Airport. Six family members who had secured visas and even bought a house in Pennsylvania arrived on a Qatar Airways flight but were returned back within hours, he said. Dent called on the Trump administration to halt immediately action on the order. \u201cThis family was sent home despite having all their paperwork in order,\u201d Dent continued, \u201cso this 90-day ban could imperil the lives of this family and potentially others, and it\u2019s unacceptable, and I urge the administration to halt enforcement of this order until a more thoughtful and deliberate policy can be reinstated.\u201d [ Trump order barring refugees, migrants from Muslim countries triggers chaos, outrage ] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) said Saturday that he backs the order but hopes for some resolution for those who were in transit as the order was announced. \u201cPausing the intake of refugees from terror hotspots is the right call to keep America safe,\u201d Royce said. \u201cI hope cases of individuals with visas traveling as this executive action went into effect \u2014 including some who served alongside U.S. troops \u2014 will be resolved quickly.\u201d Some conservatives worried that denying entry to permanent residents and green card holders could violate the Constitution. Many worried privately that the order will face significant challenges in court. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) was among the few GOP members to air his concerns publicly. Amash posted on Twitter that the order \u201coverreaches\u201d and \u201cundermines\u201d the Constitution. \u201cIt\u2019s not lawful to ban immigrants on basis of nationality,\u201d Amash tweeted. \u201cIf the president wants to change immigration law, he must work with Congress.\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) credited Trump with properly focusing on protecting the country\u2019s borders and said it is necessary to connect \u201cjihadi terrorism\u201d with Islam and particular countries. However, he also noted that the order is \u201ctoo broad.\u201d \u201cIf we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cOur generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.\u201d Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said he has \u201ctechnical\u201d questions about how the order will be implemented but supports its purpose. The statement from Ryan\u2019s office came after several requests seeking comment on how the order differs from the Muslim ban that Ryan rejected during the campaign, whether such a ban is in line with American values and if Ryan is concerned that the order is a first step towards a religious litmus test. Ryan has been a consistent advocate for increased vetting standards and has frequently said he opposes a complete ban on Muslims entering the country. \u201cFreedom of religion is a fundamental constitutional principle. It\u2019s a founding principle of this country,\u201d Ryan told reporters following a closed-door morning meeting at the Republican National Committee in December of 2015. \u201cThis is not conservatism. What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for. And more importantly, it\u2019s not what this country stands for.\u201d The majority of Republicans in Congress were silent on the order Saturday \u2014 including Senate Majority Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Calls and emails to more than a dozen top GOP lawmakers were not returned. Only one Republican senator contacted for this story had responded at the time of publication. Conservative advocacy groups, meanwhile, generally supported Trump\u2019s actions. In an interview Saturday with The Post, Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed defended Trump\u2019s executive order, calling it an \u201centirely prudent move\u201d and rejecting the notion that it amounts to a ban on Muslims or infringes on religious liberties. \u201cIt makes perfect sense not to try to build the airplane in the air,\u201d said Reed, who advocated hitting \u201cthe pause button\u201d on current practices on immigration and refugee policies, over concerns about terrorism. Congressional aides who did respond generally insisted that Trump was merely adopting a policy that passed the House last year with a veto-proof majority. The seven countries named in the order are currently included in the list of as \u201ccountries of concern\u201d by the Department of Homeland Security. People who have traveled to or lived in those countries were already subject to additional scrutiny when applying for visa waivers. One senior GOP aide said in an email that the executive order was \u201cnarrow, a faint shadow of the policy Trump ran on.\u201d The silence is a major departure from the outrage many Republicans expressed when Trump floated a Muslim ban during the campaign. At the time, several leading Republicans, including Ryan and McConnell said proposals to bar visitors based on religion are \u201ccompletely inconsistent\u201d with American values. [ Ryan, McConnell denounce Trump plan to bar Muslims from the U.S. ] Statements trickled in slowly Saturday as lawmakers and government agencies scrambled to make sense of how the order would be applied. Confusion over the directive played out at airports across the country as immigration officials attempted to decide how to handle refugees and travellers from those seven nations who were already in transit or on the ground when the exeutive order was issued. Several news outlets reported instances of travelers being detained in airports, including Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53 year old Iraqi man who spent several years acting as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraw. Darweesh was released from detention in New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy airport after two New York Democrats, Reps. Jerry Nadler and Nydia Valazquez, intervened on his behalf. Several Congressional aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said Saturday that the executive order itself does not single out a preference for Christians, and the temporary travel ban is focused on areas where terrorism is a particular concern. One senior aide dismissed as \u201cfalse\u201d accusations that the order constitutes a blanket policy against Muslims or Muslim-majority nations. The House voted last year on legislation to suspend the admission of refugees from Syria and Iraq until the White House could certify that no person entering the United States would pose a security threat. Democrats blocked a vote on the legislation in the Senate and it ultimately failed to reach President Obama\u2019s desk. [ Republicans beat back attempt to hold vote on Trump\u2019s Muslim ban proposal ] Aides also said it is not uncommon for an administration to prioritize refu\u00adgee requests on the basis of religious persecution. However, since the beginning of the \u00adSyrian civil war and the rise of the Islamic State, many more Muslims than Christians have been killed or displaced because of the violence. Additionally, a 2015 Washington Post poll found that 78 percent of Americans favored equal consideration for refugees regardless of religion. [ Two Pinocchios for Trump\u2019s claim that it is \u2018very tough\u2019 for Christian Syrians to get to the U.S. ] Ryan said Friday that while he supports the refu\u00adgee resettlement program, he thinks it is time to \u201creevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country,\u201d the speaker said Friday. Other Republicans offered similar support for the order on national seceurity grounds. \u201cPresident Trump signed an order to help prevent jihadists from infiltrating the United States,\u201d House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said in a statement. \u201cWith the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last Administration did in eight years.\u201d Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer and House GOP policy director who waged an independent presidential bid in 2016, was one of a small number of Republicans to publicly oppose the ban. McMullin tweeted a photo of the Statue of Liberty on Saturday morning, and was promptly mocked by the white nationalist Richard Spencer. \u201cThat\u2019s who they\u2019re in league with \u2014 white supremacists and white nationalists,\u201d McMullin said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting much opposition from the vast majority of Republicans in Congress. There is anti-Muslim bigotry at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and it fundamentally un-American and tangibly damaging to our national security and strength.\u201d Most Republicans, McMullin predicted, would decline to criticize the executive orders. \u201cThose who are silent on this will be defined by that silence,\u201d he said. Sean Sullivan and David Weigel contributed to this report. ",

The Kanjo children came to Southern California with their parents in August, sponsored by the First Presbyterian Church of Pomona. (Adam Donner) Harriet Ryan and Melissa Etehad Contact Reporters Ali Abdi, a 30-year-old student from Iran, has been studying for his PhD in anthropology at Yale University . Last week, he left the U.S. for the United Arab Emirates on his way to a research trip in Afghanistan. That was only days before President Trump issued his executive order on Friday suspending admissions from seven majority Muslim countries, including Iran. Now Abdi, who has been living in the U.S. for the last four years, is unsure what to do. He cannot return to Iran, where he faces potential imprisonment for his political activism. His visa for the UAE won\u2019t allow him to stay there long, nor does he have permission for an extended stay in Afghanistan. Most seriously, under Trump\u2019s new order, he can no longer return to the U.S. to finish his studies. Abdi is trying to be philosophical.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not worried about anything... From an anthropological perspective I can write a lot,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat has happened is very illuminating. The main problem is the lives of thousands of others who are torn apart by what happened.\u201d Read Trump's executive order on travel restrictions Open link The executive order signed on Friday suspends all refugee entries for 120 days, blocks Syrian refugees and bars for 90 days the entry of citizens from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. Around the world, students and workers caught outside the U.S. were uncertain when they would be allowed to return under the new executive order. Refugees expecting safe resettlement in the U.S. were stranded and detained at airports. And families whose loved ones were stranded abroad were left in a state of crippling anxiety. Many were scanning their social media feeds or watching television, trying to make sense of the new policy and understand what happens next. Bahareh Aslani, a 34-year-old Iranian American, has been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony in Baltimore in April to celebrate her marriage to her husband, Mostapha Roudsari, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. Roudsari\u2019s parents, who live in Iran, went to Dubai in December and applied for a visa to enter the U.S., waiting 2 \u00bd months for an appointment at the U.S. embassy.

They noted that terrorists who had carried out attacks in the United States had not entered as refugees, and that Muslim attackers had been people who were born here or came from countries like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia \u2014 which were not on the list of seven mostly Muslim countries that the administration has singled out for a complete halt to entry into the country. \u201cForeigners from those seven nations have killed zero Americans in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil between 1975 and the end of 2015,\u201d Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote on the group\u2019s website . Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kathleen Newland, a senior fellow and co-founder of the Migration Policy Institute, a research group, said the new policy \u201cwill do damage not only to tens of thousands of refugees, but also to the reputation of this country as a reliable partner in the global humanitarian system.\u201d But the president\u2019s executive order, issued on Friday, brought a positive, if more muted, reaction from Republicans, and could prove popular politically. During the presidential campaign, public opinion polls showed that about half of Americans favored the broader, more bluntly religion-based measure Mr. Trump originally called for, a ban on Muslims entering the country. Michael Banerian, 22, who was a Trump elector in the Electoral College, and is the youth vice chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, said he saw the president\u2019s more narrowly tailored order as common sense. \u201cI feel that it\u2019s a necessary step for us to take for the security of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s un-American. I think it\u2019s very reasonable.\u201d Kathleen Ganci, 67, whose husband, Peter J. Ganci, the highest-ranking uniformed officer of the New York City Fire Department, was killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said she supported the order \u201cbecause I know the pain that can be caused if even one person gets through.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care how difficult it makes it for these people to come over,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want other Americans to go through what I did \u2014 because we have to care for our own first, before we care for others.\u201d Impacted by Trump\u2019s order? Are you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration \u2014 or know someone who is? If you have information, please contact us at immigration@nytimes.com . Email Us The executive order put an indefinite halt to citizens of Syria, a country racked by civil war and an immense refugee crisis, entering the United States. It suspended immigration for 90 days from countries linked to terrorism that the State Department said would mean seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also suspended the nation\u2019s program for admitting refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, while the government comes up with a stricter process for vetting them, but allowed for exceptions for persecuted religious minorities, like Christians in Muslim countries. Mr. Trump said the moves were needed to protect the United States from the infiltration by \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d Speaker Ryan released a statement saying, \u201cPresident Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.\u201d Many other leading congressional Republicans did not make statements on the matter, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, whose aides said he had no plans to do so on Saturday. As reports began accumulating of legal migrants being stopped at airports in response to the president\u2019s order, some Republican aides on Capitol Hill started grumbling privately about how little the White House was defending its own policy.

Jeanne Shaheen (@SenatorShaheen) Jan. 28, 2017 The reaction was also largely negative from leaders of Silicon Valley , which relies heavily on employees from abroad, and has many companies founded or headed by immigrants or their children. A Google representative said, \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.\u201d Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, a United States citizen who was born in India, sent a memo to the company\u2019s work force, saying that as many as 187 of its employees who happened to be overseas were affected by the travel restrictions. In the memo, first reported by Bloomberg News , Mr. Pichai urged affected employees to contact Google\u2019s security team, noting that one person rushed back from New Zealand before the order was signed.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Saturday spoke for the first time since Trump was sworn in -- a much anticipated talk about future relations between two world powers with a complicated history, including recent reports that Putin and Russia worked to influence the 2016 White House race on behalf of Trump. Trump and Putin were expected to discuss the sanctions that Trump\u2019s predecessor, President Obama, imposed on Russia for annexing Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula in 2014. The White House has yet to release details of the conversation. The Kremlin said the world leaders talked about Ukraine, Iran\u2019s nuclear program, North Korean aggression and better trade and economic ties but made no mention of the sanctions. The message on the Kremlin website, translated to English, also stated that Trump and Putin talked about coordinating efforts to defeat the Islamic State and other terror groups around the world, particularly in Syria, torn apart in a bloody civil war that is approaching its sixth anniversary. Putin has backed the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al Assad, while the United States favors an end to his rule.\u00a0 The Kremlin also stated the leaders are working on a face-to-face meeting, but no date has been set. The Putin call was just one of five Saturday by Trump to world leaders. Trump, sworn in last week, also spoke by phone with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe; German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. He is scheduled to speak later today with Australia Prime Minster Malcolm Turnbull. In Trump's first call of the day, he and Abe discussed the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance and cooperation on regional and global issues including investments and bilateral trade, according to the White House. Trump also affirmed the United States\u2019 commitment to ensuring the security of Japan, amid the continuing threat of North Korea. And the two leaders discussed the significance of Secretary of Defense James Mattis' upcoming visit to the region, including Japan, the White House said.\u00a0 The annexation was widely considered an act of aggression toward neighboring Ukraine's effort to have a more democratic government.\u00a0 Even the possibility of Trump lifting the sanctions has brought widespread concern, and criticism, from Washington Democrats and Republicans and from around the world. \"For the sake of America\u2019s national security and that of our allies, I hope President Trump will put an end to this speculation \u2026 and reject such a reckless course,\u201d Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain said in a statement. \u201cIf he does not, I will work with my colleagues to codify sanctions against Russia into law.\" Trump had said that he is prepared to review the sanctions, as part of a large effort to improve relations with the United States\u2019 former Cold War rival. But he was noncommittal Friday, saying, \"We'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that.\" Trump\u00a0made the remarks Friday alongside British Prime Minster Theresa May, whose country -- as part of the European Union -- also levied sanctions on Russia following its provocations in Ukraine. May has said the sanctions should remain in place.\u00a0 May\u2019s White House trip made her the first world leader to visit Trump since he took office last week. \u00a0 Putin and Trump spoke after Trump\u2019s presidential victory in November. Though they have never met, each has expressed admiration for each other\u2019s forceful leadership style. The U.S. intelligence services recently released a report that found Putin and Russia meddled in the White House race, in which Trump upset Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton. The report found no evidence of vote tampering. But months of stolen, then leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta had some damaging impact on Clinton\u2019s presidential bid. Trump has been openly critical of the report, and the Kremlin has denied involvement in the race. \u00a0 Recent polls show that\u00a0 anti-American sentiment in Russia has dropped to 56 percent . Pollsters say it\u2019s due to Trump\u2019s indication he wants to improve relations. The Kremlin has welcomed\u00a0Trump's\u00a0promises to mend ties with Moscow, which also has been badly strained by the war in Syria. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Syrian children play in the snow in the Deir Zeinoun refugee camp in  eastern Lebanon, on Jan. 28, 2017. President Trump has issued a ban on all immigrants from Syria. (Photo: Hassan Jarrah, AFP/Getty Images) President Trump suspended\u00a0the U.S. refugee program for 120 days,\u00a0banned all immigrants from seven Muslim countries for 90 days and ordered his administration to develop \"extreme vetting\" measures for immigrants from those countries\u00a0to keep \"radical Islamic terrorists\" out of the United States. The order, signed Friday, also bars all Syrians from entering the U.S., and gives preference in admission to Christians, whom he said are persecuted in majority\u00a0Muslim countries. More coverage:\u00a0 Here's a look at what's involved with the refugee ban: What's the difference between immigrants and refugees? Immigrants are people from other countries who come to the United States for a variety of personal reasons, such as seeking a better life than in their native countries. Refugees are a special class of immigrants who seek asylum from war, persecution and other risks to their safety. They have protected status under international law. Who are the refugees admitted to the U.S. in 2016? Most of the 85,000 refugees admitted in 2016 came from countries that are at war\u00a0or under the control of\u00a0repressive governments. Top admissions from Africa came from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (16,370)\u00a0and Somalia (9,020).\u00a0From East Asia, most came from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, (12,347).\u00a0The greatest number of Europeans came from Ukraine (2,543),\u00a0which is at war with Russian-backed irregular troops in the east. Colombians (529)\u00a0fleeing an insurgency topped the list from South America, and Syrians (12,587)\u00a0and Iraqis (9,880)\u00a0fleeing civil war and terrorist groups\u00a0topped the list from the Near East and South Asia. Trump says immigration ban working 'nicely\u2019 as protests, detainments hit airports How many refugees has the U.S. admitted in the past? Total U.S. refugee admissions have dropped steadily from 146,158\u00a0in 1975, when 135,000came from Asia, according to the State Department. Does Trump have the legal authority\u00a0to block refugees and other immigrants? He may on security grounds. A president has the power to shut down the refugee program completely\u00a0without approval from Congress. Federal law allows\u00a0the\u00a0president to bar entry to any immigrant \u201cor any class\u201d of immigrants if he\u00a0deems them \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States,\" and to \"impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,\" according to the law: U.S. Code \u00a7 1182 - Inadmissible aliens: \"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\" How many immigrants does the U.S. admit, and how many come from the seven countries on Trump\u2019s list? The State Department issued 617,752 immigrant visas and 10,891,745 non-immigrant (tourist\u00a0and worker) visas in 2016. One out of 20 immigrant visas \u2014 roughly 30,000 \u2014 went to people from the seven majority Muslim countries cited by the president: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. Why did he single out those seven countries? Three of them \u2014 Iran, Sudan and Syria \u2014 comprise the State Department\u2019s\u00a0list of state sponsors of terrorism. The other four \u2014 Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 are designated \u201cterrorist safe havens\u201d by the State Department. Have any refugees from those countries recently committed terrorist acts in the U.S.? No. The two major U.S.\u00a0terrorist attacks that occurred in 2015 and 2016 involved people with ties to countries not on that list: Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando\u00a0last June,\u00a0was a U.S.-born\u00a0Afghan-American who'd traveled to Saudi Arabia in recent years.\u00a0 And\u00a0Syed\u00a0Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the married couple who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., on Dec. 2, 2015, also had no ties to those seven countries. Farook was born in the U.S. to Pakistani immigrants, and his wife was a recent arrival from Saudi Arabia, which\u00a0Farook had visited. How are refugees now vetted? The State Department says it has the most exhaustive background system of any country in the world. Refugees are first interviewed in their home countries and their backgrounds are checked carefully during a process that can take up to two years. Some\u00a0refugees worked for the U.S. military in Iraq as translators or in other jobs and are seeking asylum for fears of being singled out for their association with the U.S. government. Why is there a total ban on Syrians? Syria is a concern because the Islamic State militant group that is behind terrorist acts around the world still operates\u00a0in the country, which has been devastated by a nearly six-year-long civil war. About 11 million Syrians\u00a0\u2014 half the population\u00a0\u2014 have been displaced. Who are the Syrians being admitted to the U.S.? The State Department says the vast majority of the 12,587\u00a0admitted last year are women and children, and only 2% are single young men who are most likely to commit terrorist acts. Can Trump block entry of immigrants who already received visas and traveled to the United States? That will likely be decided by the courts. Immigration officials denied entry to immigrants from the seven countries after Trump signed the executive order, prompting lawsuits by some immigrants. Can Trump block or favor refugees based on their religion? Legal experts say a ban on Muslim immigrants rather than a ban on immigrants from specific countries that have\u00a0Muslim majorities would be challenged\u00a0based on the First\u00a0Amendment, which guarantees freedom of religion. His call for giving preference to Christian refugees may be challenged on religious-freedom grounds. 8633 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 163 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jIlSOX NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "By Reena Flores CBS News January 28, 2017, 12:14 PM Democrats condemn Trump order on refugees, citizens from Muslim nations Email A day after President Trump signed an executive order halting refugees and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, several legislators -- so far, all of them Democrats -- are condemning the immigration action.\u00a0 \u201cDuring the Holocaust we failed to fulfill to our duty to humanity,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, warned in a statement Friday, also commemorated internationally as Holocaust Remembrance Day. \u201cWe cannot allow mindless fear to lead us into another regretful chapter in our history.\u201d \u201cHistory will judge where America\u2019s leaders stood today,\u201d Durbin continued. \u201cFaced with the humanitarian crisis of our time, the United States cannot turn its back on children fleeing persecution, genocide, and terror.\u201d\u00a0 The executive order -- signed by Mr. Trump the same day the White House issued a statement on the Holocaust promising to \u201cmake love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world\u201d -- directed the State Department to stop the processing of Syrian refugees indefinitely. It also included a four-month suspension of the broader U.S. refugee program and a ban on citizens from seven countries with majority Muslim populations (Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya) traveling to the U.S. Mr. Trump has also said his refugee plan will prioritize Christians fleeing persecution over those with other religious affiliations. Mr. Trump\u2019s actions were felt immediately: the crackdown on the refugee program was swift, with refugees -- traveling in the air to the U.S. when the order was signed -- already encountering detentions upon their arrival at U.S. airports. According to one New York Times report, at least one of the Iraqis detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport had worked on behalf of the U.S. government in Iraq for a decade. Sen. Claire McCaskill referenced the Times report in a critical tweet early Saturday, saying the incident \u201cmakes me want to throw up.\u201d\u00a0 This makes me want to throw up. pic.twitter.com/R7Gf9Yc5Js \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) January 28, 2017 Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, a Democrat and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, slammed the immigration order as a \u201csmokescreen for religious discrimination that is entirely contrary to our founding values and core constitutional principles.\u201d\u00a0 Another Senate Foreign Relations Committee member, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, went further: In an op-ed that ran Friday in the Huffington Post, Murphy predicted ominously that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals were \u201clikely to get Americans killed.\u201d \u201cThe ban doesn\u2019t cover every Muslim globally,\u201d Murphy wrote, \u201cjust a set of Muslims from countries Trump perceives, rather arbitrarily, to be dangerous.\u201d \u201c[T]he fact that every country on today\u2019s list is a Muslim-majority nation confirms that he meant what he said -- that Muslims are dangerous and need to be treated differently than any other set of people,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Sen. Bob Casey, in a series of tweets, called the executive order details even \u201cmore troubling than the initial reports\u201d and observed that signing the action was a largely political move.\u00a0 I've had classified briefings, voted for legislation to improve screening. @realDonaldTrump executive order is about politics, not security. https://t.co/rwxTSeeOMu \u2014 Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) January 28, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump 's exec order imposes a religious test on refugees- it is deeply inconsistent w/ our values & won't make our nation safer. \u2014 Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) January 28, 2017 Escaping religious tests is exactly why people colonized America 400 years ago. Subjecting refugees to such a test is not who we are. \u2014 Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) January 28, 2017 A host of other Democratic legislators blasted the order, with some, like Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, striking a tone of solidarity with refugees affected by the ban.\u00a0 \u201cTo everyone afraid of what this executive order will mean for you and your country, I say: \u2018You are not alone. We are with you. And we will fight for you.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Republicans, for their part, have largely remained silent since Mr. Trump signed the order.\u00a0 Still, several lawmakers have, in the past, condemned prioritizing certain religions over others when it comes to immigration to the U.S. In July, House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted a statement saying he rejected then-candidate Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban.\u00a0 \u201cA religious test for entering our country is not reflective of America\u2019s fundamental values,\u201d Ryan wrote at the time. Despite his previous stance, Ryan, in a statement released Friday, praised Mr. Trump\u2019s latest executive order.\u00a0 \u201cOur number one responsibility is to protect the homeland,\u201d Ryan wrote, calling the U.S. a \u201ccompassionate nation\u201d but that it was \u201ctime to reevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cPresident Trump,\u201d he added, \u201cis right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.\u201d Similarly, in December of 2015, then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence tweeted his own message about Mr. Trump\u2019s call to bar Muslims from stepping foot in the U.S., which he said was \u201coffensive and unconstitutional.\u201d Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional. \u2014 Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015 Pence, now the vice president, stood by Mr. Trump on Friday as the president signed his executive order. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Veuer's Keleigh Nealon (@keleighnealon) has the story. Buzz60 Muslims and immigration activists participate in a prayer service and rally, Friday, in New York City. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee received more than 1,000 calls by midday Saturday from people who have been stranded or detained in the U.S. and abroad as a result President Trump's ban on immigrants and refugees. The executive order, signed at the Pentagon on Friday, suspends the entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, halts the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely\u00a0and bars entry for three\u00a0months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of\u00a0Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan,\u00a0Libya,\u00a0Somalia\u00a0and Yemen. Abed Ayoud, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said legal immigrants who were traveling overseas to attend funerals and visit family when Trump signed his order are now unable to return to the U.S. Foreigners studying at U.S. universities who were part of study abroad programs are also stuck. Even Customs and Border Protection agents are confused about how to handle Trump\u2019s order and responding in different ways, he said. \u201cThe impact of what President Trump was looking for is in full effect,\u201d Ayoud said. \u201cComplete chaos.\u201d Melanie Nezer, vice president of HIAS, a Jewish group that is one of nine refugee resettlement agencies, said more than 2,000 refugees were scheduled to fly into the U.S. next week. She said 850 of them came from the seven countries barred by Trump. The American Civil\u00a0Liberties\u00a0Union and the\u00a0Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, say they have either filed lawsuits or will do so shortly challenging the ban. Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project protested the president's action in a statement on the organization's website :\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump's war on equality is already taking a terrible human toll. This ban cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d Read more:\u00a0 Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Their synagogue, Am Shalom (\u201cNation of Peace\u201d) in Glencoe, Ill., displays a statue depicting members\u2019 families who perished at the Nazis\u2019 hands. The Syrian family, and the president\u2019s orders, were coming on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, some of the volunteers noted with tears in their eyes. A hundred synagogue members had contributed in some way to helping resettle the Syrians: renting an apartment steps from a playground, assembling a vacuum cleaner, lining up juice boxes in the refrigerator. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some of the synagogue members had signed on instinctually, so the Syrians would be helped the way their own parents or grandparents had been aided when they arrived in the United States. Others had joined as a way of countering Mr. Trump \u2014 just a few of the many Americans, of varied backgrounds, reacting with shock, outrage and concern to his curtailment of the country\u2019s long-established refugee resettlement system. Photo Volunteers from the synagogue made signs to welcome the Syrian family, arriving just as President Trump closed the door to refugees from the country. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times \u201cThe Statue of Liberty has always been our symbol of welcome,\u201d Rabbi Steven Stark Lowenstein, the group\u2019s leader, said at the airport. \u201cIt feels like Trump turned off the light,\u201d he said. At the Pentagon on Friday, the preparations for the president\u2019s actions were orderly: High-level officials gathered in a room called the Hall of Heroes, and photographers assembled. But around the country, refugees, resettlement workers and volunteers expressed panic. Resettlement workers did not know if they would have jobs once Mr. Trump\u2019s refugee and immigration plans have been fully carried out. Volunteers wondered what they would do with furniture and money they had collected for refugees who were supposed to arrive soon. RefugeeOne, the resettlement agency responsible for the family coming into O\u2019Hare, had been expecting another Syrian family to arrive on Monday. Photo Julie Stark and her husband, Rabbi Steven Stark Lowenstein, just before Ms. Stark accompanied the Syrian family to their new home. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times \u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d Kim Snoddy, the program\u2019s liaison to groups like the Am Shalom volunteers, said as she waited with them at the airport on Friday. A volunteer from another Chicago group posted a photograph on Facebook of an empty crib, made up with a pink sheet and a stuffed bunny, for the baby of a family that would no longer arrive. Resettlement workers and volunteers across the country said that since Election Day, Americans of diverse backgrounds had been lining up to aid refugees, channeling their opposition to Mr. Trump into a desire to help vulnerable newcomers. Sloane Davidson, 37, a graduate student in Pittsburgh, hosted refugees for Thanksgiving dinner and said she was so moved by the experience that she took a job as a case aide at a local agency . \u201cThe more I learned about what I felt to be the truth and the truth that Trump was telling,\u201d the more she wanted to get involved, she wrote in an email. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Resettlement agencies said that volunteers had been swarming their offices and that even more had surfaced last week when Mr. Trump\u2019s specific plans became public. When the International Refugee Assistance Project put out a call for lawyers to help new arrivals in danger of being turned away, it received 3,000 volunteers in four hours, said Becca Heller, the organization\u2019s director. \u201cPeople are desperate to help refugees as a way to counter these discriminatory policies,\u201d she said. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More As the minutes passed at O\u2019Hare, the volunteers checked the time again, tense with the knowledge that Mr. Trump was about to commit pen to paper. The family they were awaiting had flown into Washington the night before, meaning they had cleared immigration with less than a day to spare. But the volunteers said they would not be able to exhale until the newcomers landed in Chicago. The flight was delayed, they heard. They glanced at the time on their phones again. As soon as the Syrian family of four stepped into the baggage claim area, the synagogue members surrounded them protectively, offering the flowers and signs, as a resettlement worker translated. Because they spoke no English, the newcomers wore tags around their necks, like Paddington Bear, so if they got lost, they could be identified. In a moment, the two Syrian children\u2019s arms were laden with gift bags of toys. The parents said they were too terrified to talk to a reporter, out of concern for family members \u2014 some still trapped in dangerous areas of Syria and others who had been cleared to travel to the United States but had not yet received plane tickets.

(Photo: Bernard Thomas, The Herald-Sun via AP) Donald Trump's first week in office was a dizzying one\u00a0in which the new president\u00a0appeared to be in perpetual motion,\u00a0signing 15 executive actions, speaking to 11 world leaders and\u00a0visiting three federal agencies. There was no letting up on the action Saturday, which turned into a full working day at the White House, as refugees were stopped from boarding U.S.-bound planes and criticism over the president's latest executive order blossomed. The\u00a0order suspends the entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, halts the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely\u00a0and bars entry for three\u00a0months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of\u00a0Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan,\u00a0Libya,\u00a0Somalia\u00a0and Yemen. Here's a quick look to help you keep up with all the news: Trump says immigration ban working 'nicely\u2019 In brief remarks while signing his latest executive orders Saturday, Trump maintained the order isn't a \"Muslim ban.\" \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely. We\u2019re going to have a strict ban, and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years,\" he said. Stranded travelers and their families take to Twitter People are sharing stories of\u00a0family and friends stranded all over the world as a result of\u00a0President Trump's temporary ban on immigrants.\u00a0On Twitter, people posted tales of\u00a0stranded students in Iran, visitors abroad unable to return home and canceled\u00a0visits with family. Here's another sad case of an Iranian green card holder being denied entry to the United States... #MuslimBan @BahmanKalbasi @ASE @rezaaslan pic.twitter.com/W3ycAYqTym \u2014 Trita Parsi (@tparsi) January 28, 2017 Advocacy group flooded with 1,000 calls amid 'complete chaos' Abed Ayoud, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said they\u2019ve received more than 1,000 calls by midday Saturday from people who have been stranded or detained in the U.S. and abroad.\u00a0He said legal immigrants who were traveling overseas to attend funerals and visit family when the president\u00a0signed his order are now unable to return to the U.S. Foreigners studying at U.S. universities who were part of study abroad programs are also stuck. Even Customs and Border Protection agents are confused about how to handle Trump\u2019s order and responding in different ways, he said.\u00a0\u201cThe impact of what\u00a0President Trump\u00a0was looking for is in full effect,\u201d Ayoud said. \u201cComplete chaos.\u201d Kremlin: Trump, Putin agree to coordinate on fighting Islamic State Amid the criticism of the immigration ban, President Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin spoke by phone Saturday and agreed to establish \"real coordination\" to \"crush ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria,\" the Kremlin said, referring to the Islamic State.\u00a0Cooperation with Russia in Syria would represent a break with current policy and a rift among Republican foreign policy leaders. Sen. John McCain, R.-Ariz., on Friday warned Trump against cooperating too closely with Putin, whom he accused of propping up a \"murderous regime\" in Syria. The White House has yet to issue it's statement on the discussion. Trump also spoke on Saturday with\u00a0Japanese\u00a0Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe,\u00a0German Chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u00a0and Australian Prime Minister\u00a0Malcolm Turnbull.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 28, 2017 8:54 PM EST The director of an Oscar-nominated film can\u2019t attend next month\u2019s Academy Awards after President Trump banned entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim majority nations for 90 days, according to the leader of an Iranian-American group in Washington. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said on Twitter early Saturday that Iranian director Asghar Farhadi \u201cwon\u2019t be let into\u201d the U.S. to attend the Feb. 26 ceremony. Confirmed: Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's. He's nominated for best foreign language film... #MuslimBan \u2014 Trita Parsi (@tparsi) January 28, 2017 The ban also appeared to have an effect on American companies. Late Friday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in an internal email that at least 187 Google employees were affected by the ban, according to The Wall Street Journal . A look back at President Trump's whirlwind first week in office \u201cWe\u2019re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,\u201d Pichai said, according to the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.\u201d Farhadi\u2019s \u201cThe Salesman\u201d was nominated for best foreign film. His much-admired \u201cA Separation\u201d won the category in 2012. \u201cThe Salesman\u201d is a psychological thriller about a young couple in Tehran involved in a production of Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman.\u201d They move into a new apartment, where a violent act connected to a former tenant changes their lives. 35 Photos Oscars 2017: The nominees Before Mr. Trump enacted the ban late Friday, Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti, who stars in \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d said she would boycott the Academy Awards to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cTrump\u2019s visa ban for Iranians is racist,\u201d she posted on Twitter Thursday amid reports about the ban. The order Friday immediately suspended a program that last year resettled in the U.S. roughly 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice. Mr. Trump indefinitely blocked those fleeing Syria, where a civil war has raged, and imposed a 90-day ban on entry to the U.S. from seven Muslim majority nations. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. \u201cWe only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\u201d IRC CEO on possible impact of barring refugees Mr. Trump said the halt in the refugee program was necessary to give agencies time to develop a stricter screening system. While the order did not spell out what additional steps he wants the departments of Homeland Security and State to take, the president directed officials to review the refugee application and approval process and find any more measures that could prevent those who pose a threat from using the refugee program. The U.S. may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government will continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \u201cprovided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country.\u201d In an interview with CBN News, Mr. Trump said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status. \u201cWe are going to help them,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been horribly treated.\u201d Breaking down President Trump's first week in office The order was signed on Mr. Trump\u2019s most robust day of national security and foreign policy at the start of his presidency. He met with British Prime Minister Theresa May and had a lengthy phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. As a candidate, Mr. Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to the U.S. He later shifted his focus to putting in place \u201cextreme vetting\u201d procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties. The State Department said the three-month ban in the directive applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen - all Muslim-majority nations. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of the executive order. \u201cThere is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,\u201d Lena F. Masri, the group\u2019s national litigation director. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d During the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000. According to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, he plans to cut that to 50,000. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later. The president was applauded by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said it was \u201ctime to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.\u201d But many Democrats cast the measures as un-American. \u201cTears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Mr. Trump\u2019s order was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day, which brought to mind the global effort to help refugees during World War II and its aftermath. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

But the June 2015 shootings at Emanuel AME continue to prompt a conversation about the uneasy intersection of faith and gun violence, as thousands of worshippers around South Carolina gather this weekend to memorialize crime victims and call for reform. It isn't just the church slaughter that has sounded the alarm bells. The Center for American Progress found South Carolina ranked sixth in the nation for the overall rate of gun violence, noting someone was killed with a gun in the state roughly every 13 hours. Events throughout the state are part of Stand Up Sunday, launched last year by a group meeting in the very room where the Rev. Clementa Pinckney and eight others were gunned down as they prayed. Pinckney's lifelong best friend, fellow AME Pastor Kylon Middleton, is now heading the group he says provides an opportunity for people of faith to stand up for those they've lost and talk about real solutions to problems of gun violence. Middleton was recently chosen to head the board for Arm-In-Arm: South Carolinians for Responsible Gun Ownership, a grassroots group of more than 1,200 faith leaders, gun owners, teachers and others across South Carolina that is coordinating the weekend's events. What they all have in common, Middleton says, is a desire to find ways to cut down on gun violence. Prosecutors who secured a death sentence against Roof argued the 22-year-old white supremacist researched and picked his victims because, as loyal, churchgoing folk, he figured they'd be less likely to resist his attack. He fired his first shot at Pinckney as the worshippers closed their eyes in the evening's final prayer. Stand Up Sunday isn't about encouraging people to arm themselves as they worship, although the group counts among its members people who have purchased weapons and practiced using them in real-life situations. This weekend, congregants are signing petitions and talking about ways to cut down on violent gun deaths in South Carolina. At Charleston's Mt. Zion AME, where Middleton is pastor, the altar will be decorated with white crosses bearing the names of South Carolina gun violence victims, whose names will be read aloud in Sunday's service. Choir members will sing a song specially written to talk about gun violence in South Carolina. \"It allows us the opportunity to articulate their story and to give them a space to at least publicly be acknowledged in their grief, and to move the pendulum in another direction toward activism,\" Middleton told The Associated Press recently. Roof, who was sentenced to death last month in a federal trial, should never have been able to purchase a gun because of a prior drug arrest. But authorities later told The Associated Press that, due to a combination of errors, Roof managed to buy one anyway. Victims' families are suing the FBI for negligence in allowing the sale. FBI Director James Comey has said Roof should have never been allowed to buy the gun and promised a full review. Advocates for tighter gun regulations have pushed for more days to be added onto South Carolina's three-day waiting period, but that legislation has failed. There are several bills pending in South Carolina's recently reconvened Legislature dealing with guns, including a measure that would require a national instant background check before sales, exchanges or transfers. Gerald Malloy, a former Senate colleague of Pinckney's and also his personal friend, has made such a proposal this year. Existing laws, Middleton said, \"are useless unless the gaps in our existing background system are fixed.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

The ban extends to workers who have visas and green cards and are currently out of the country. Executives from Microsoft , Google , Netflix , and Y Combinator, as well as educators at MIT and Carnegie Mellon, were among technology leaders who condemned President Donald Trump's wide-reaching order to block travelers from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer wrote on LinkedIn that there are 76 Microsoft employees from the 7 countries who have work visas, and are affected by the new order. It is offering those employees legal support regarding immigration. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks as PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel and Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook look on during a meeting with technology leaders at Trump Tower in New York U.S., December 14, 2016. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton - RTX2V24G \"(C)  / Reuters\" / REUTERS \"We share the concerns about the impact of the executive order on our employees from the listed countries, all of whom have been in the United States lawfully, and we're actively working with them to provide legal advice and assistance,\" Microsoft told CNBC. Facebook also told CNBC that it was assessing how to protect its workers from adverse effects. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was one of the first to address the ban publicly. \"We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Friday. In an internal memo obtained by Recode , Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees, \"There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them.\" Cook concluded by quoting Dr. Martin Luther King: \"We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.\" Netflix CEO Reed Hastings wrote on Facebook , \"Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe.\" Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky also advocated for \"open door\" policies: Open doors brings all of US together. Closing doors further divides US. Let's all find ways to connect people, not separate them. \u2014 Brian Chesky (@bchesky) January 28, 2017 Uber told CNBC that it had 12 employees affected by the order, and is offering legal support. In an internal memo seen by Mike Isaac of the New York Times, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick also pointed out that the ban affects \"thousands\" of Uber drivers who \"take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family.\" Sam Altman, president of prestigious start-up program Y Combinator, called on tech leaders to take action, writing in a blog post on Saturday that \"it is time for tech companies to start speaking up about some of the actions taken by President Trump's administration.\" Slack boss Stewart Butterfield tweeted that America is \"throwing away\" its moral authority with the ban. \"Immigration is unambigously an economic benefit, but, doesn't matter: [D]o the right thing because it's right,\" Butterfield tweeted. \"And he's just getting started.\" \u2022 It's still so hard to believe that this is real life. Nearly every action seems gratuitously \u2026 evil. https://t.co/ZcpdeUnlYf \u2014 Stewart Butterfield (@stewart) January 28, 2017 Anil Dash, CEO of Fog Creek Software, which helped create products like StackOverflow and Trello, called for more action from the technology community. \"It's time for leaders at Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft who were at that Trump roundtable to stepup,\" Dash tweeted. \"You've done it for crises before.\" It's time for leaders at Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft who were at that Trump roundtable to step up.

Tom McClintock, R-Calif., was quoted as saying in Saturday's Washington Post, one of the media organizations that obtained an audio recording of a private session at last week's GOP strategy retreat in Philadelphia, \"That's going to be called 'Trumpcare.' Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel, and we'll be judged in the election less than two years away.\" Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., worried that Republican plans could strip health insurance from many of the 20 million people who gained covered through the Affordable Care Act , including through the expansion of Medicaid. \"We're telling those people that we're not going to pull the rug out from under them, and if we do this too fast, we are in fact going to pull the rug out from under them,\" MacArthur was quoted as saying. The Post said the remarks made by McClintock and others were confirmed by their offices or the congressmen themselves. The concerns focused on how to quickly repeal Obama's program and replace it without depriving people of coverage or driving up premiums. Rep. John Faso, R-N.Y., warned against eliminating federal money for Planned Parenthood , as many Republicans hope to do with the repeal. \"We are just walking into a gigantic political trap if we go down this path of sticking Planned Parenthood in the health insurance bill,\" he said. Faso's remarks drew tepid applause, according to the account. The Post said Congress has been left without explicit guidance from Trump or his administration. Andrew Bremberg, who heads Trump's domestic policy council, attended the session but offered few details about what legislative proposals the president favors, the report said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "How Trump's National Security Memorandum Could Boost Military Readiness By Luis Martinez Jan 27, 2017, 9:57 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump Signs Executive Orders at Pentagon 0 Shares Email President Trump today signed a national security memorandum that he said will \"begin a great rebuilding of the Armed Services of the United States, developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources, and new tools for our men and women in uniform.\" The memorandum also orders reviews that would modernize America's nuclear weapons systems and strengthen its missile defense capabilities. Trump often characterized the U.S. military during his presidential campaign as having been \"depleted\" during the Obama administration. But the lower funding levels the U.S. military experienced in recent years were forced by the Budget Control Act of 2011 that mandated government spending cuts known as sequestration. U.S. military officials have said that while their services are still able to carry out their missions, the reduced funding has affected some of their readiness and required training. \"This is the rebuilding of the United States armed forces,\" Trump told an audience of about 100 of the Defense Department 's senior military and civilian leaders gathered to witness the ceremonial swearing-in of Defense Secretary James Mattis . \"I promise that our administration will always have your back,\" Trump said after signing the memorandum. \"We will always be with you.\" Here\u2019s a look at the two-page memorandum that Trump says will strengthen the U.S. military. Trump Says He'll Give Christian Refugees Priority What is in the memo? Addressed to the Defense secretary and director of the Office of Management and Budget , the memorandum states that \"it shall be the policy of the United States to rebuild the U.S. Armed Forces.\" It gives Defense Secretary James Mattis, a retired Marine general, 30 days to conduct a review to assess \"readiness conditions, including training, equipment maintenance, munitions, modernization, and infrastructure.\" The review will guide what actions can be carried out in the current fiscal year \"that are necessary to improve readiness conditions,\" as well as in the FY 2017 budget proposal that is still working its way through Congress a year after it was submitted. Mattis will also have 60 days to submit a plan of action that by FY 2019 \"shall address areas for improvement, including insufficient maintenance, delays in acquiring parts, access to training ranges, combatant command operational demands, funding needed for consumables (e.g., fuel, ammunition), manpower shortfalls, depot maintenance capacity, and time needed to plan, coordinate, and execute readiness and training activities.\" The Defense Department will be required to submit a National Defense Strategy \"to give the President and the Secretary maximum strategic flexibility and to determine the force structure necessary to meet requirements.\" The memorandum also requires a review of the nuclear triad \"to ensure that the United States nuclear deterrent is modern, robust, flexible, resilient, ready, and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our allies.\" It also calls for a new review of Ballistic Missile Defense \"to identify ways of strengthening missile-defense capabilities, rebalancing homeland and theater defense priorities, and highlighting priority funding areas.\" Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump is greeted by Defense Secretary James Mattis ahead of Mattis' ceremonial swearing-in, Jan. 27, 2016, at the Pentagon in Washington. What could the military get? The military services will likely make the case for increased budgets to make up for the personnel reductions and lower levels of training that have resulted from sequestration. In recent years the Army has downsized to about 470,000 soldiers, down from the force of 570,000 soldiers at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army could find a receptive ear from the Trump administration if it wants to add more soldiers in uniform because Trump\u2019s presidential campaign included his advocating for growing the Army back to 540,000. Trump also wanted to grow the Marine Corps to 36 combat battalions. Such an increase would require a boost from the current force of 183,000 Marines. But a more pressing need for the Marine Corps is maintaining and refurbishing its aging and overused fleet of planes and helicopters. The strain on its aircraft has been labeled a crisis because of the significant drops in the readiness levels this year that have at times left half its aircraft unavailable to fly. He also recommended during the campaign an increase in the number of fighter aircraft available to the Air Force to 1,200. While more aircraft might be welcome, the Air Force also wants more personnel to ease the strain of the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In December, Gen. David Goldfein, the chief of staff of the Air Force, suggested that if sequestration cuts were done away with, the Air Force should grow by 33,000 airmen to 350,000 over the next seven years. The Navy recently issued an assessment that recommended growing to a fleet of 355 ships with more aircraft carriers, submarines and surface warships. That estimate is similar to the Trump campaign proposal to boost the number of ships to 350. Both proposals would be a dramatic increase from the current fleet of 274 ships that is slated to grow to 308 by 2021. While increased funding could lead to more ships, top Navy leaders acknowledge telling the Trump transition team at the Pentagon that their focus is on maintaining the ships they have. That's because the pace of Navy ship deployments has remained constant as the number of ships has decreased over the past decade. The upshot is less time for crucial long-term maintenance work needed to keep those ships functional for decades to come. 0 Shares ",

By Avi Selk By Avi Selk January 28 at 1:36 PM Follow aviselk President Trump signed an executive order halting all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days, among other provisions. Here's what the order says. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Vice President Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis stood directly behind their boss Friday, one man on each side, as President Trump\u00a0announced an\u00a0order that will\u00a0ban half the world's Shiite Muslims from entering the country for months. \u201cI'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States,\u201d Trump said from his podium at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don't want 'em here.\u201d Pence nodded along to the\u00a0words. It was just over a\u00a0year earlier when\u00a0he had called Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States \u201coffensive and unconstitutional.\u201d That was before Trump picked him as his running mate and won the election. Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional. \u2014 Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015 Trump sat down after his speech, signed the executive order and handed it to Mattis \u2014 a retired general who six months earlier had said the mere suggestion of a ban on Muslims caused \u201cgreat damage\u201d to world order. Now, Mattis was defense secretary. He took the order\u00a0and grinned while Pence started clapping. Like other Republicans, the\u00a0two men's condemnations of Trump's\u00a0words had evaporated as he\u00a0drew closer to power \u2014 and as his original call for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d morphed into a nearly 3,000-word\u00a0order that does not mention Islam but temporarily bar visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. [ 12 Nobel laureates, thousands of academics sign protest of Trump immigration order ] One of those countries, Syria, had attracted Pence's scrutiny even before a young Trump campaign waded into the issue in late 2015. He\u00a0was one of more than two dozen governors who called for a suspension of Syrian refugees that year \u2014 as a civil war there fueled fears that terrorists would slip into the United States amid the wave of evacuees. But when Trump upped the ante\u00a0in December \u2014 calling for a border ban on all Muslims \u201cuntil our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on\u201d \u2014 Pence joined\u00a0the immediate Republican backlash. Trump's words may have been\u00a0\"offensive\"\u00a0to Pence, but they were popular with others. After winning contest\u00a0after contest\u00a0in the spring primaries and turning his sights on the general election, Trump blasted Democrat Hillary Clinton for border policies that would \u201clet the Muslims flow in.\u201d Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in. No way! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016 A few months later, a taciturn retired\u00a0general who had\u00a0overseen all U.S. military operations in the Middle East felt compelled to speak out against Trump. The call for a\u00a0Muslim ban was causing American allies to think\u00a0\u201cwe have lost faith in reason,\u201d Mattis told Politico last July. \u201cThey think we've completely lost it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's sending shock waves through this international system.\u201d He and Pence were\u00a0joined in displeasure by Republicans across the spectrum. By\u00a0former vice president Richard B. Cheney, who said banning a religion \u201cgoes against everything we stand for,\u201d \u00a0and who echoes language\u00a0by\u00a0 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan \u00a0and many others. Even\u00a0Trump's campaign eventually distanced itself from his\u00a0rhetoric. \u201cDonald Trump's Contract with the American Voter,\u201d released last October, mentions no Muslim ban, but rather \u201cextreme vetting\u201d and a halt on immigration \u201cfrom terror-prone regions.\u201d [ What is an executive order? And how do President Trump\u2019s stack up? ] And by late 2016, with prospects for\u00a0White House jobs\u00a0in the wind, some of\u00a0Trump's former critics went\u00a0mum on the issue. A CNN host confronted Pence about his silence in October, long after he'd left the Indiana governor's office to campaign as Trump's running mate. \u201cWhat he has said about women, about Mexicans, about Muslims matters,\u201d the host said. \u201cNow you are tacitly accepting those positions because you won't speak out.\u201d \u201cIt's not Donald Trump's position now,\u201d Pence said of the ban, according to CNN. He fell\u00a0back on the campaign's latter-day\u00a0language about terrorist-linked countries rather than Muslims. Trump's secretary of state designate backed the president up at his confirmation hearing this month. \u201cHe does not support a blanket-type rejection of any particular group of people,\u201d Rex Tillerson promised Congress. Sure enough, Friday's executive order makes no mention of Islam. It bans any visitors from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia from entering the United States for any reason for three months, with broader\u00a0restrictions on the refugee program. [ As Trump bars Syrian refugees, life in their camps is getting harder ] None of those seven countries make up more than a few percentage points of the global Muslim population, according to a 2009 Pew study , although together they contain the majority of world's Shiite Muslim minority. And just before signing the order, Trump suggested to\u00a0the Christian Broadcasting Network that religion was not far from his mind. Once he restarts the refugee program, Trump\u00a0told the outlet, Christians fleeing war and terror in the Middle East would get priority over others. \u201cThey were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,\u201d he said of Syria \u2014 failing to mention that far more Muslims have been killed or displaced in that civil war. Neither Pence nor Mattis have commented in public about the executive order after applauding its signing on Friday. But another compatriot from their days as Trump critics has offered his take. Ryan, who once called any Muslim ban un-American, said in a statement Friday that \u201cPresident Trump is right.\u201d \u201cWe are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it's time to reevaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process,\u201d Ryan said. An earlier version of this post incorrectly said Trump handed the pen he used to sign the order to Mattis. He handed Mattis the order itself. More reading: ",

    "text": "Jan 27 2017, 12:44 pm ET Students Sound Alarm and Avert Florida School Massacre by Corky Siemaszko advertisement A potential tragedy at a central Florida charter school was averted when students sounded the alarm that two of their classmates were planning to \"shoot up the school on Friday.\" The whistleblowers alerted authorities that the accused teenagers had warned certain students at the Villages Charter Middle School to wear white shirts and say the safety word \"Eugene\" to avoid getting shot, according to a police report released by the Sumter County Sheriff's Office. Students at The Villages Charter Middle School in Sumter County, Fla., told educators about a rumor that potentially averted a school shooting. WESH A 13-year-old suspect \"was intercepted by authorities as he attempted to arrive\" at the school on Wednesday, the sheriff's office revealed in a press release . \"At the time, he acknowledged conversations involving the plot and referenced the mass shootings at Columbine High School,\" the sheriff's office said. The teenage suspect also implicated a 14-year-old boy who was \"quickly\" located at the school, which is located in the town of The Villages, about 60 miles west of Orlando. \"The student informed officials that the two students had planned an attack which included what they would use as a signal to open fire,\" according to the sheriff's office. \"No weapons were found on either of the students or in their bags or lockers.\" But firearms were found in the Fruitland Park home of the 13-year-old and in the Wildwood home of his alleged accomplice \u2014 one of them an AR-15 assault rifle, according to the police report. Both students are now charged with conspiracy to commit murder and local law enforcement is breathing a big sigh of relief. Students at The Villages Charter Middle School in Sumter County, Fla., told educators about a rumor that potentially averted a school shooting. WESH \"The Sumter County Sheriff's Office is grateful for those students brave enough to speak out about the plot,\" the sheriff's office said. \"Their heroic actions may have prevented a deadly tragedy and loss of precious lives.\" The sheriff's office did not identify the students who went to authorities and the school referred all calls back to law enforcement. Under questioning, the suspects gave a tearful confession during which the younger teen said he had been depressed, according to the police report. \"I just want to die,\" he told investigators and insisted he had been joking about staging the shooting. But under questioning, the teenage suspects also admitted they were supposed to meet at the gym and start shooting. The signal to open fire? A dropped pencil. The April 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado by two disgruntled students has been the inspiration for other massacres. Among them the murders of 20 first-graders and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut by another troubled young man armed with an AR-15 assault rifle. Corky Siemaszko ",

    "text": "Intentionally or Not, Big Brands Help Fund Fake News By tali arbel, ap technology writer NEW YORK \u0097 Jan 28, 2017, 11:29 AM ET 0 Shares Email Wittingly or not, major global corporations are helping fund sites that traffic in fake news by advertising on them. Take, for instance, a story that falsely claimed former President Barack Obama had banned Christmas cards to overseas military personnel. Despite debunking by The Associated Press and other fact-checking outlets, that article lives on at \"Fox News The FB Page,\" which has no connection to the news channel although its bears a replica of its logo. And until recently, the story was often flanked by ads from big brands such as the insurer Geico, the business-news outlet Financial Times , and the beauty-products maker Revlon. This situation isn't remotely an isolated case, although major companies generally say they have no intention of bankrolling purveyors of fake news with their ad dollars. Because many of their ads are placed on websites by computer algorithms, it's not always easy for these companies to steer them away from sites they find objectionable. Google, the biggest player in the digital ad market, places many of these ads. The company says it bars ads on its network from appearing against \"misrepresentative content\" \u2014 its term for fake news \u2014 yet Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville acknowledged that the company had sold ads on the site with the Christmas-card story. Those ads vanished after The Associated Press inquired about them. Faville declined to comment on their disappearance. ADS THAT GO WHERE THEY WILL Media advertising was much simpler when companies had only to buy ad space in newspapers or magazines to reach readers in a particular demographic category. Digital ads, by contrast, can wind up in unexpected places because they're placed by automated systems, not sales teams, and targeted at individuals rather than entire demographics. In effect, these ads follow potential customers around the web, where a tangle of networks and exchanges place them into ad slots at online publications. These middlemen have varying standards and levels of interest in helping advertisers ensure that their ads avoid controversy. \"A brand wouldn't have a real foolproof way of not getting on sites that have issues like this,\" said Joseph Galarneau, CEO of the New York City startup Mezzobit, which helps publishers and marketers manage advertising technology. AUTOMATIC FAKE-NEWS FUNDING Such automated ads are a major income source for fake news stories, which may have influenced voters in the U.S. presidential election . False stories can undermine trust in real news \u2014 and they can be dangerous. A widely shared but untrue story that pegged a Washington, D.C., pizzeria as part of a Hillary Clinton-run child sex trafficking ring led a man to fire a gun in the restaurant. This largely invisible web of automated exchanges and ad networks funds millions of online sites, from niche, small-traffic blogs to professional news and entertainment sites with audiences in the tens of millions. By tracking web users to smaller sites, advertisers can reach them more cheaply than by limiting themselves to \"premium\" websites like the Washington Post, CBS or ESPN. The megaphone of social media can give marginal sites a big lift. When a fake-news story spreads on Facebook, lots of people end up on the article's original site \u2014 and ads follow. The result: Big companies help fund some low-rent websites trafficking in conspiracy theories and other unverified claims, at the measly rate of a fraction of a cent per person per ad. WHERE \"FAKE\" FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS While advertising technology vendors have safeguards in place to help mainstream advertisers avoid porn or hate speech, those don't always work for spoof news sites, said Marc Goldberg, CEO of Trust Metrics. Advertisers pay him to keep them off unwanted sites. That's partly because \"fake news\" can be hard to define. And while advertisers can come up with \"blacklists\" of sites to avoid, there's no guarantee that ad-tech vendors farther down in the food chain will honor it, said Susan Bidel, an advertising analyst for research firm Forrester. Many publishers and advertisers use Google's ad technology without having Google sell their ads. In those cases, Google's misrepresentative-content policy doesn't apply. BRANDS IN A BIND When the AP pointed out that a Chrysler Ram truck ad popped up on a story saying that the United Nations was making the U.S. pay reparations to African-Americans \u2014 it's not \u2014 Fiat Chrysler said it works with ad companies to scour individual sites and block them from loading its ads if it finds them \"harmful.\" An ad for would-be Amazon rival Jet.com, owned by Walmart, showed up on a misleading story claiming California had legalized child prostitution . The company said in an emailed statement that it has filters that stop its ads from loading \"on these kinds of sites,\" but wouldn't provide more detail or explain its criteria. Walgreens ads also popped up next to the child prostitution story on the site The Red Elephants, but the drugstore chain has since prevented its ads from appearing there, a company spokesman said. A person who responded to an email sent to The Red Elephants declined to discuss the site's advertising, but insisted that the child-prostitution story was true. The person declined to provide their name. A Financial Times spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that the media company was \"frustrated\" to learn that its ads appeared next to fake news like the Christmas-card story, saying the situation underscored the \"very real risk\" of using automated ads. \"We think the ad technology ecosystem could, and should, do more to improve brand safety,\" she said. Revlon declined to comment. A Geico spokeswoman said the company didn't know about its ad that ran on the spoof Fox News site. 0 Shares ",

President Trump speaks on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin Saturday in the Oval Office. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin spoke by phone Saturday and agreed to establish \"real coordination\" to \"crush ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria,\" the Kremlin said, referring to the Islamic State. The White House put out a short statement later on the one-hour phone call, saying it \"ranged in topics from mutual cooperation in defeating ISIS to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including Syria.\" It added that \"the positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair.\" Cooperation with Russia in Syria would represent a break with current policy and a rift among Republican foreign policy leaders. Sen. John McCain, R.-Ariz., on Friday warned Trump against cooperating too closely with Putin, whom he accused of propping up a \"murderous regime\" in Syria. Word of warming relations\u00a0also comes after the U.S. intelligence concluded the Russians meddled in the presidential election. The Kremlin's statement, issued before one put out by the White House, said nothing about reports that Trump is considering lifting sanctions on Russia. McCain also warned Trump not to ease up on sanctions, saying he would work in Congress to give them the force of law. The Kremlin said the two presidents also discussed \"major aspects of the Ukrainian crisis,\" as well as discussing \"possible dates and venue of their personal meeting.\u201d The two also agreed to \u201cmaintain regular personal contacts.\" Russia boosted its military support to the regime in Syria in 2015 after it appeared rebels trying to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad were threatening his hold on power. Moscow claimed that its airstrikes in Syria were aimed at terrorists. The White House, State Department and Pentagon maintained that Russian attacks primarily targeted moderate opponents of Assad and not the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS,\u00a0and al-Qaeda-linked terrorists. The Pentagon and Russian military have established communication links to prevent accidents between warplanes. The Pentagon has stressed that this effort does not indicate cooperation with the Russian military. McCain labeled Putin a \"murderer and a thug\" and said he would \"never be our partner, including in fighting ISIL.\" \u201cRussia has propped up the murderous Assad regime as it has waged war on the Syrian people and killed more than 400,000 civilians,\" McCain said in a statement. \"Russia\u2019s military has targeted Syrian hospitals and first responders with precision weapons. Instead of targeting ISIL, Russia has focused its operations against the moderate Syrian opposition, which has only empowered extremist forces in the country.\" The call with Putin and other world leaders capped off a dizzying nine-day stretch in which Trump appeared to be in perpetual motion, signing 15 executive actions, speaking to 11 world leaders, visiting three federal agencies and, on Friday, hosting British Prime Minister Theresa May. In addition to Putin, Trump spoke Saturday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe,\u00a0German Chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. He was scheduled to speak with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday night. Trump assured Abe of the U.S. commitment to Japan's security, according to the White House. Trump and Abe also discussed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' trip to Japan and South Korea this week and the threat from North Korea.\u00a0They spoke about deepening trade ties days after Trump dumped the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Asia-Pacific trade deal. The leaders\u00a0plan to hold a meeting at the White House on Feb. 10. For Merkel, the top issues on the agenda was the U.S. commitment to NATO. Trump seemed to question that commitment during the campaign \u2014 questioning whether European allies were paying their fair share and whether the alliance was sufficiently tooled to address terrorism. But in their call Saturday, the two leaders \"agreed on the NATO Alliance's fundamental importance,\" according to a White House summary of the call. Trump plans to visit Germany in July for the G-20 Summit of major economies. Read more: ",

Attorneys have not yet been able to determine the number of fliers detained, as customs officials are not allowing attorneys or their families any access or communication with the detainees, said immigration attorney Jordan Cunnings. \u201cWe\u2019re literally walking around, asking people, are you waiting for someone who has been detained?\u201d said Cunnings, describing a scene of worried family members who had arrived bearing flowers and welcome signs for their loved ones. Some of the detained travelers included green-card holders, tourists, people with children and people with medical problems, Cunnings said. One detained traveler was an Iranian woman who'd held a green card in the U.S. for five years and whose citizenship swearing-in ceremony is in two weeks, Cunnings said. \u00a0The woman has an 11-month old child with her who is an American citizen. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have phone access or communication access to the people waiting for them, or their attorneys,\u201d Cunnings said. \u201cIt'\u2019s just really heartbreaking.\u201d A candlelight vigil to support Muslim refugees is scheduled for Saturday afternoon at Los Angeles International Airport. Meanwhile, another protest was underway in downtown Los Angeles. The vigil comes in response to President Trump\u2019s executive order suspending refugee arrivals and banning travel to the United States\u00a0from seven Muslim-majority countries. The abrupt ban ensnared people from all walks of life who were caught in transit or expecting to soon return to the U.S.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0students on a break from studies, business travelers, tourists, even the bereaved who had gone home for a funeral. The LAX candlelight vigil is being organized by the Service Employees International Union, and several politicians are expected to attend, including\u00a0Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon. A group of advocacy organizations,\u00a0including the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a legal action against the policy on Saturday in New York, acting on behalf of two Iraqis who were stopped at John F. Kennedy International Airport hours after the order was signed. The writ seeks the release of the two Iraqis, who hold valid U.S. visas, unless the government can show lawful grounds for their detention. The groups bringing the action, which also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry.

Administration officials described the bans as historic in scope. But it was not immediately clear how either one would be enforced. Trump has said individuals who want to aid him in his quest to \"Make America Great Again\" should focus on the jobs they will be doing to help the American people, and not thinking about the future income they could rake in by peddling their influence after serving in government. Related: Trump Signs Order Suspending Admission of Syrian Refugees \"Most of the people standing behind me will not be able to go to work,\" Trump joked, referring to an array of White House officials lined up behind him as he sat at his desk in the Oval Office. The officials included Vice President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus, senior strategist Steve Bannon and counselor Kellyanne Conway. \"So you have one last chance to get out.\" Trump said he talked about the ban a lot during the campaign and \"we're now putting it into effect.\" In a separate action Saturday, Trump took steps to begin restructuring the White House National Security Council. Aides said the changes would help the council better adapt to cyber, digital, terrorist and other modern-day threats. A third action gives the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the president's top military advisers, 30 days to prepare a plan to defeat the Islamic State group. Related: Trump Travel Restrictions Leave Refugees Stranded: Reports Trump had released the plan for a lobbying ban a few weeks before the November election. It would ban all executive-branch officials from lobbying for five years after leaving their government jobs, and impose a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government \u2014 one of several promised policies aimed at curbing the influence of lobbyists. Some have argued that the ban could make it difficult for Trump to fill thousands of jobs across the administration, saying some candidates may chafe at being asked to agree to the ban and turn down job offers as a result. The phrase \"'drain the swamp'\" became a staple of the final month of Trump's presidential campaign, with crowds chanting it as loudly as they had been shouting \"build the wall\" and \"lock her up,\" references to the wall Trump wants built on the U.S.-Mexico border and his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, respectively. It remained part of Trump's postelection \"thank you\" tour of states he won, as audiences shouted along when he vowed to curtail corruption in Washington.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday expressed his support for President Trump\u2019s controversial plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying the barrier he built along his country\u2019s southern border \u201cstopped all illegal immigration\u201d and was a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d Trump on Wednesday signed executive actions to start the construction of a continuous, \u201cphysical\u201d wall, making good on a campaign promise to keep out illegal immigrants from Mexico, particularly \u201crapists\u201d and drug dealers. \"Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders,\" Trump declared. \"We are going to save lives on both sides of the border.\" Trump has forged ahead on the wall promise, despite Mexico refusing to pay the bill, as Trump said it would. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto responded almost immediately Wednesday to Trump\u2019s declaration, saying in a nationally televised address that he regrets and rejects the president\u2019s decision, nixing a planned meeting between the two leaders. Wall construction is projected to cost $8 billion to $20 billion, with Congress scrambling for ways to promptly find the money. The president's executive orders also call for hiring 5,000 additional border patrol agents and 10,000 more immigration officers, though the increases are subject to the approval of congressional funding. \u201cPresident Trump is right,\u201d tweeted Netanyahu, who is trying to forge a better relationship with Trump than the one he had with previous President Obama. \u201cI built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\u201d The southern wall in Israel -- completed in 2013 after two years of construction and paid for by Israel -- is not the West Bank barrier, built to end terror attacks launched from Palestinian Arab cities. The barrier was built because Israel was facing problems from the influx of tens of thousands of African illegal immigrants through Egypt -- mostly from Eritrea, Sudan, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Nigeria and seeking employment and asylum.\u00a0 Many of the immigrants were escaping the atrocities in Darfur, but their arrival also coincided with an spike in crime, more burden on the Israeli health system and other social problems. Those coming into the U.S. from the south are seeking better economic conditions and include people fleeing El Salvador and other parts of Central America, ravaged by poverty, violence and other consequences of the region\u2019s drug wars. The Associated Press and Fox News' Jonathan Wachtel contributed to this report.\u00a0 \u00a0 ",

    "text": "At Least 27 People Detained or Sent Home Following Trump's Executive Order By Michael Edison Hayden Jan 28, 2017, 6:04 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Signs Executive Orders at Pentagon 0 Shares Email At least 27 passengers have been detained or sent home from four different airports across the country today, and hundreds of people around the world were barred from boarding U.S.-bound flights following President Trump's executive order on immigration. One of at least two Iraqis detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City has been released, according to New York officials. In all, 11 people were still detained at the airport, the officials said. Other passengers were detained or sent home from Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport, according to officials in those cities. Hundreds of people turned out at JFK to protest the protest the president's order, chanting \"No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here. No hate, no fear, Musims are welcome here.\" Hameed Jhalid Darweesh, the Iraqi freed from Kennedy Airport, left with New York Congressional Reps. Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, who joined more than 100 protesters that assembled there. Court records confirm that a writ of habeas corpus was filed for Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq, the other Iraqi, in the Eastern District of New York, where the airport is located, and that Donald Trump was named as a defendant. Darweesh expressed his gratitude for those who supported him while he was detained. \"First of all, I want to thank the people that take care of me and support me. They leave their family, their business and come to support me. This is what pushed me to move, to leave my country and come here. And I'm very, very thankful to all of the people who have come to support me,\" he said to reporters at the airport. \"America is the land of freedom,\" Darweesh said. \"The land of freedom, the land of the rights. This is what brought me to come here, and I'm very thankful.\" Trevor Collens/AFP/Getty Images An aircraft takes off from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport against a hazy backdrop of the New York skyline, May 25, 2015. Neither Darweesh nor Abdulkhaleq are technically refugees according to the definition in the president's executive order but appear to have come to the U.S. on visas, a Trump administration official tells ABC News. The executive order contains a caveat that allows certain individuals to be admitted to the country if there is a national security interest in doing so, and these two may be eligible for such an exemption, which must be agreed upon by the State and Homeland Security Departments, but the process by which this happens is unclear. At least one person was detained at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago today, and it is expected that she will return to Saudi Arabia, according to the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Sahar Alghnimi, a Syrian woman who came to the U.S. on tourist visa to see her mother who had just undergone cancer surgery, was detained when she arrived from Saudi Arabia at 8:48 AM on Eithad Airlines, CAIR Chicago executive director Ahmed Rehab told ABC News. Alghnimi had been to the U.S. several times before and has a valid visa, Rehab said. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP President Donald Trump signs an executive order for border security and immigration enforcement improvements at the Department of Homeland Security in Washington, Jan. 25, 2017. In Philadelphia, two Syrian families were detained. Mayor Jim Kenney issued a statement on Trump's executive order, suggesting that the detentions were carried out by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. In Dallas, nine people have been detained, according to a media representative of CAIR. Ripple effects from the executive order are also being felt in multinational technology companies. Google CEO Sundar Pichai circulated a staff memo , obtained by Bloomberg News, in which he criticized Trump's action and suggested that some of the firm's employees and their families could be affected by it. Likewise, several colleges advised foreign students and scholars who might be affected by Trump's order to defer travel outside of the U.S. at least until there is more clarity on how the order may affect them. Trump categorized the executive order as part of a vetting plan to prevent \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from reaching American soil. The seven-page document calls for an immediate suspension of immigration from countries with ties to terror -- Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Libya -- for a time period of 90 days. But none of the countries on the list have had anything to do with terror incidents on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks, and Saudi Arabia -- where 15 of the 9/11 hijackers were from -- is not included. It also calls for the complete suspension of Syrian refugees for an indefinite period. It also calls on the secretary of state to suspend the entire U.S program for admitting refugees for 120 days while authorities review the application and adjudication process. Green card holders, who are legal residents of the United States, also fall under Trump's executive order on immigration if they come from any of the seven Muslim-dominated countries from which immigration is temporarily banned, according to a senior administration official who spoke to ABC News. Trump told the the Christian Broadcasting Network that Christian refugees would be given priority over Muslims in applications to come to the U.S. \"We are going to help them,\" Trump said of Christians in Syria.

A statement on the company\u2019s website says: \u201cNationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\u201d It listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. Lawyer explains why he works to help Muslims in U.S. Dutch airline KLM confirmed to CBS News that it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on refugees . Manel Vrijenhoek, at KLM\u2019s press office, told the Associated Press said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities. Also, airport officials in Cairo said six U.S.-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York\u2019s JFK airport. Cairo airport officials say the five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family would return to Iraq. They said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Erbil, capital of Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region, Sunday morning. They added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.
