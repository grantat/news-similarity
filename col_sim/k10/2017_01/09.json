Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Schumer responded on Saturday by saying that the letter had made clear that the Trump transition team colluded with Senate Republicans to \u201cjam through\u201d the nominees. Several of the nominees are millionaires or billionaires and have vast webs of financial interests that must be untangled. The Trump transition team issued a statement on Saturday evening defending its handling of the nomination process. Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W. Bush, said he thought none of the nominees could receive a full vote on the Senate floor before the vetting was complete. Norman Eisen, Mr. Obama\u2019s ethics counsel in his first term, said the paperwork delays were \u201ctotally unheard-of.\u201d The status of the background checks and ethical clearances can change by the day. Republicans say they expect the missing documents to be submitted for all the nominees eventually. The hearings are scheduled to begin on Tuesday, with testimony from Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the nominee for attorney general, and Gen. John F. Kelly, the pick for homeland security secretary. On Wednesday, the parade of nominees is expected to include Rex W. Tillerson, the choice for secretary of state; Betsy DeVos, the pick for education secretary; and Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, the nominee to lead the C.I.A. Later in the week, the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr., chosen as commerce secretary, and Andrew F. Puzder, the labor secretary pick, are scheduled to come before congressional panels. While some of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees, notably Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the choice for health secretary and an ardent opponent of the Affordable Care Act, are certain to receive hostile receptions, large numbers of Democrats will probably vote for many others. Still, Democrats are preparing a furious assault against the nominees by going after the president-elect himself and trying to drive a wedge between them over his most incendiary promises, like banning Muslim immigrants and bringing back torture. \u201cWhere will they come down?\u201d Mr. Schumer, the new Democratic leader, asked in an interview. \u201cWill they try to persuade the president that\u2019s the wrong way to take America?\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Democrats plan to keep the focus on the president-elect to a degree with few historical parallels. New presidents usually serve as a backdrop; this year, by contrast, Mr. Trump\u2019s words will loom over the hearings as Democrats press the nominees to take a position on them. Democrats have little chance of blocking any of the nominees, having given up the use of the filibuster in such cases when they were in the majority, but they say Mr. Trump has handed them ample political ammunition. Mr. Sessions is certain to be asked whether he, as attorney general, would make good on Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges to get a special counsel to \u201cjail\u201d Hillary Clinton over her email server. General Kelly can expect questions about whether he favors Mr. Trump\u2019s call to build a wall on the Mexican border and create a database on Muslims. Mr. Pompeo is likely to be asked about his views on Mr. Trump\u2019s support for waterboarding and his skepticism about the intelligence agencies\u2019 findings on Russian election meddling. Mr. Tillerson will probably face a grilling over Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris climate accord. Mr. Tillerson has spent hours trying to quietly assure lawmakers that he would take a more distant stance than Mr. Trump on the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, with whom Mr. Tillerson had close relations as the head of Exxon Mobil. The Trump transition team, which did not comment on the background checks, is bracing its nominees for questions about the president-elect\u2019s more controversial positions, according to people with knowledge of the preparations. But officials would not say what tack the nominees would take in responding. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI have no doubt that the president-elect and a number of his comments will come up,\u201d said Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sessions\u2019s confirmation team. \u201cBut Senator Sessions has a long record of service himself.\u201d Mr. Sessions will testify before the Judiciary Committee, which is generally friendly territory for sitting senators. But he is likely to face blistering questions from Democrats who are concerned about his civil rights record. In the 1980s, racially charged accusations derailed his nomination to a federal judgeship. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said she would press Mr. Sessions to say where he stood on Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges to have a special counsel further investigate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cHillary\u2019s situation is done, and other than some kind of gross retribution, there\u2019s no reason for that to even be something to look at,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said in an interview. By posing tough questions, said Sarah A. Binder, a political scholar at George Washington University, Democrats will try to lure the nominees into inflicting political damage on themselves by adopting some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more divisive language. She said the terrain was so risky that the nominees might be better served by adopting a stance usually seen only from judicial nominees: \u201cDon\u2019t take a position.\u201d Democrats intend to use all the procedural moves available to slow the process on the Senate floor, possibly spending up to 30 hours per nominee, denying Mr. Trump a full cabinet when he takes office. Republicans are indignant. \u201cHolding up confirmations just for delay\u2019s sake is irresponsible and it is dangerous,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. He added, \u201cThis is a dangerous world we are living in, and why in the world would we want to make it even more dangerous just to let our colleagues delay for delay\u2019s sake President-elect Trump getting to fill his cabinet, particularly these important national security offices?\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2017, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Senate to Push Nominees by Trump, Some Unvetted.

(Photo: NBC, Will Heath, NBC) Alec Baldwin is ready to do his make-fun-of-Donald-Trump thing even when he's not getting paid by Saturday Night Live. Only he might want to find a better Russian translator. SNL is on a break so Baldwin wasn't cavorting as Trump this Saturday. Instead, he went to his Instagram page to post a picture of himself, looking rather sinister in a red baseball cap with white lettering, like those red caps that Trump wore during his presidential campaign saying, \"Make America Great Again.\" A photo posted by Alec Baldwin (@iamabfalecbaldwin) on Jan 6, 2017 at 8:26am PST It was supposed to be a sight gag: The white lettering was in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet. \"Make America Great Again,\" only in Russian. Chuckle, chuckle: A not-subtle reference to Trump's fondness for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and his initial rejection of the findings of a unified U.S. intelligence community that Putin likely led a Russian effort to influence or interfere in the 2016 presidential election. (On Sunday, the president-elect's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said Trump now accepts that the Russians played a role in hacking Democrats during the election, but Trump himself hasn't said so and he has a history of later contradicting what his surrogates say.) The result of said election: Trump is set to become\u00a0the 45th president of the United States on Jan. 20. But Baldwin's joke went somewhat awry when Russian speakers pointed out that the Russian grammar on Baldwin's hat was incorrect and likely stemmed from Baldwin's use of Google Translate, reported CNN . Jill Dougherty, CNN's former Moscow bureau chief,\u00a0said the Cyrillic on Baldwin's cap is not how actual Russians would say Trump's slogan or write it.\u00a0\"In fact, we just Google-translated it, and it's translated exactly like on the cap,\" Dougherty said. Ooops. The Trump trolling rolls on as Baldwin returns to 'SNL' Baldwin got more than 24,000 likes and more than 2,000 comments on his Instagram picture. Many of them were appreciative (\"Hilarious!\" \"Amazing!\"), many of them were not (\"You are an old has been,\" \"Your brain has been hacked\").\u00a0In fact, it has to be said that hardly anyone on social media in America is a stickler for grammar and punctuation in English, let alone Russian. \"Thanks, love your humor, great job doing trump. Hope you can use this hat on SNL,\" posted Cheryl\u00a0Russell. \"Comrades don't let comrades use Google Translate. It should say '\u0412\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0451\u043c \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435',\" posted batcopyeditor. Alec Baldwin defends playing 'grilled cheese sandwich' Donald Trump on 'SNL' Since he debuted his fish-lipped Trump impersonation on SNL, Trump has tweet-bashed Baldwin and SNL as unfunny and unfair. But as of Sunday morning, he confined his tweets to blasting another favorite bete noire: The media. Before I, or anyone, saw the classified and/or highly confidential hacking intelligence report, it was leaked out to @NBCNews . So serious! ",

By Max Bearak January 8 at 2:14 PM Follow @maxbearak HYDERABAD, India \u2014 The ritual goes like this: If you\u2019re approaching the god Balaji with an appeal, walk in a circle around the temple 11 times and leave an offering of tulsi leaves at his feet. Should your wish be granted, come back and do it 108 times.\u00a0 \u201cWe call him Visa Balaji,\u201d said Madhu Vadlamani, 25.\u00a0\u201cHe is famous for granting visas.\u201d Vadlamani and her husband of just three days, Revanth Chilakamarri, 29, were but two of thousands of worshipers orbiting the \u201cVisa Balaji\u201d temple near here one \u00adrecent morning. Years ago, the incarnation of Vishnu had blessed them both with student visas to the United States. Though they had grown up just seven lanes apart, they met in America and fell in love.\u00a0 The two software developers had returned to the temple that morning to appeal to Balaji, in hopes of renewing their American sojourn with a new visa \u2014 the H-1B.\u00a0 For the new political order taking shape in Washington, how\u00adever, H-1Bs aren\u2019t quite welcome. Amid promises of sweeping changes to immigration policy, President-elect Donald\u00a0Trump and his choice for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), have tabbed the\u00a0program for a major overhaul, and might even scrap it altogether.\u00a0In the House, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) is on the same wavelength. The visas bring nearly 100,000 \u201chighly skilled\u201d contract workers, mostly in tech and mostly from India, to the United States every year. Most stay for multiple years, and some eventually get green cards. According to federal guidelines, H-1Bs are intended to fill positions for which American workers with the requisite skills can\u2019t be found. Whether the program always does that is\u00a0intensely debated by industry lobbyists and politicians, and companies are not legally required to ensure that result.\u00a0 Trump has described H-1Bs as a\u00a0\u201ccheap labor program\u201d subject to\u00a0\u201cwidespread, rampant\u201d abuse. Sessions co-sponsored legislation last year with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to effectively gut the program; Issa, a congressman with Trump\u2019s ear, released a\u00a0 statement Wednesday saying he was reintroducing similar legislation called the Protect and Grow American Jobs Act.\u00a0 Sessions probably will give at least a glimpse of his plans regarding the program at his confirmation hearing Tuesday.\u00a0 Sessions and Issa\u2019s legislation primarily targets large outsourcing companies, such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, that receive the vast majority of H-1B visas and use them to deploy workers to American companies seeking to cut costs. In 2015, the top 10 recipients of H-1B visas were outsourcing firms. As recently as 2013, the Justice Department, which Sessions stands to take over, settled with Infosys for $34 million in a visa fraud case. \u201cLogically speaking, I\u2019m worried,\u201d said Vadlamani, who until recently worked for Deloitte in Orlando.\u00a0\u201cBut being Indian, I believe that if it is in my karma, then I will get the visa. If not, there are more and more jobs these days at good companies here.\u201d But if Vadlamani is circumspect about her prospects should the visa program be restricted, politicians and business executives in her home town\u00a0are bullish. Not only is employment booming in Hyderabad, they say, but should the United States move against H-1Bs, their economy stands to gain.\u00a0 The H-1B program provides American companies with cheap, temporary contractors who often work longer hours than Americans and take on the monotonous programming jobs Americans scorn. Proponents of the program argue that foreign workers increase innovation at American companies as well as contribute to local economies. A few Indians who came on work visas have even gone on to become heads of important American companies.\u00a0 Meanwhile, India\u2019s growth as a global tech hub has been hampered as tens of thousands of workers have left.\u00a0 Over the past decade, though, cities like Hyderabad and Bangalore have slowly but surely gained prominence. At first, Hyderabad was mostly a base for outsourcing companies servicing American clients, but now it is home to the biggest offices of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook outside the United States. Amazon, Dell, Uber and others\u00a0have major operations there. All have huge campuses in a part of the city officially known as Cyberabad.\u00a0 Cyberabad\u2019s existence is the result of investments in education and infrastructure made by N. Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, where Hyderabad was located until the state was bifurcated in 2014. A network of dozens of information-technology institutes trained a generation of engineers and software developers to work back-end jobs for American companies. For that generation, getting an H-1B was the holy grail. Even though the work in America could be dull, being there provided a chance to engage with an invigorating culture of innovation that just wasn\u2019t present in India yet. And of course, working abroad meant a huge increase in income and prestige. But the H-1B cap meant that the bulk of Indian tech workers stayed back. The current cap \u2014 not just from India \u2014 is 65,000, plus another 20,000 who have graduated from American universities with advanced degrees, down from almost double that at the beginning of the 2000s.\u00a0 Among those who do get the visas, most ultimately return to settle and work in India. In Hyderabad, many of those returnees are confident that their city can compete with Silicon Valley for India\u2019s brightest young minds. K.T. Rama Rao, the son of the current chief minister, was one of them. Now he\u2019s the minister for information technology in his father\u2019s government. He pointed to Apple as an example of how Hyderabad could absorb the thousands of workers in a potential future with far fewer H-1Bs \u2014 or without them altogether.\u00a0 \u201cApple is already moving their maps division here, and they\u2019re doing that because we\u2019re producing more G.I.S. talent than anyone else in the world,\u201d he claimed in an interview, referring to geographic information systems.\u00a0\u201cIdeally, a president of the United States would have a balanced perspective on business, but if he wants tech firms to stay, he should create better job readiness in the U.S.\u201d Rao said that legislation targeting big Indian outsourcing companies would wean them away from their dependency on servicing American companies. Without the visa program, they would have to engage in new lines of work that created value in Hyderabad and not abroad, he said. Amit Jain, now the president of Uber India, is another returnee who used to be on an H-1B. He said that the influx of American companies, as well as a growing indigenous start-up culture, could offer what Indians used to seek in the United States closer to home. \u201cWe definitely have a more robust ecosystem here now,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re seeing plenty of hiring in the future.\u201d Read more: ",

    "text": "Rivers Rise as Massive Storm Moves Into Northern California By olga r. rodriguez, associated press SAN FRANCISCO \u0097 Jan 8, 2017, 2:36 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press A van drives through flooded water on Green Valley Road in Graton, Calif., Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017. On the California coast, weather forecasters anticipate a storm surge from the Pacific called an atmospheric river to dump several inches of rain from Sonoma to Monterey counties, and up to a foot in isolated places in the Santa Cruz mountains. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) 0 Shares Email Rivers were rising and winds were whipping up across Northern California on Sunday as a massive storm that could be the biggest to slam the region in more than a decade arrived. Residents and authorities cleared storm drains and stacked sand bags, preparing for the system expected to reach full force late Sunday and early Monday. Some flooding was reported Sunday morning, including along U.S. 101 in Sonoma County, where stranded motorists had to be rescued. Swift water teams performed rescues at a mobile home park in Marin County, where officials reported road closures and some damage from flooding and fallen trees. Authorities were watching rising water levels of several rivers, including the Cosumnes, Truckee, Merced, American and Russian. Forecasters warned of heavy rain that could down trees and trigger mudslides as the system gains strength throughout the day. Several feet of snow were predicted in the Sierra Nevada . A woman was killed Saturday by a falling tree on the San Francisco Bay Area golf course. The stormy weather comes as California enters its sixth year of drought. Each drop of rain is welcomed, but officials said several more big storms are needed to replenish depleted groundwater supplies. The strong wet season began in October with more rain falling than in three decades, mostly in Northern California. Los Angeles, which will likely get the brunt of the latest system early Monday, is experiencing its wettest winter in six years, forecasters said. Forecasters anticipate the storm surge stretching from Hawaii \u2014 called an atmospheric river \u2014 could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some foothills communities. The storm's relatively mild temperatures will drive up the snowline to above 9,000 feet throughout the Sierra Nevada, causing runoff in the lower elevations, said Zach Tolby, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada. Flooding could rival the winter of 2005-06 that sent 5 feet of water into an industrial area in Sparks, Nevada. Crews worked to secure storage drums filled with hazardous materials to stop them from floating away as they have in past floods. In the Pacific Northwest, residents braced for treacherous roads and the possibility of nuisance flooding. Most flights were canceled at the airports in Portland and Eugene, Oregon. Officials urged residents in Boise, Idaho to dig pathways to allow rain and runoff from 15 inches of snowmelt to drain. Back in California Rangers at Yosemite National Park closed all roads leading to the park's valley floor, a major attraction for visitors from around the world eager to view gushing waterfalls and gaze up at towering granite rock formations such as El Capitan and Half Dome. Other parts of the park remain open, but rangers cautioned visitors to be aware of ice and falling debris on the roads. Photographer and rock climber Josh Hilling, who lives in the foothills below the park, spent recent days chopping wood and stocking up on groceries. \"If you live long enough in this canyon, you experience lots of natural disasters \u2014 floods, fires, rock falls,\" Hilling said Friday from his family's home in El Portal. Another storm is forecast for Tuesday and with the ground already saturated, rain won't seep into the soil quickly enough and extra runoff could end up in already swollen rivers and creeks, officials said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles and Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho contributed. 0 Shares ",

By John Wagner and Ylan Q. Mui January 8 at 2:49 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @ylanmui Billionaire investor Carl Icahn will have the ear of President-elect Donald Trump as an adviser focused on cutting government regulations. But Icahn also stands to benefit if his advice is taken: It could make the energy companies and others in which he has a stake more profitable. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who\u2019s a major figure in her father\u2019s business, has been present at transition meetings and is expected to continue to counsel him at the White House. So, too, is her husband, Jared Kushner, who has a web of business interests of his own that could be affected by Trump administration policy. And another Trump intimate \u2014 his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2014 is making no secret of his desire to profit on his continuing closeness to Trump, setting up a new lobbying firm with an office just a block from the White House. With confirmation hearings set to start for Trump\u2019s Cabinet, ethics experts are voicing alarm about several other confidants of the president-elect \u2014 dubbed the \u201cshadow Cabinet\u201d by one \u2014 who might not be subject to such scrutiny and could face a tangle of potential conflicts between their personal interests and those of the public. His lawyer said this weekend that Kushner is preparing to resign from his position overseeing his family\u2019s real estate empire and to divest \u201csubstantial assets\u201d if he takes a role in Trump\u2019s White House. Trump advisers Stephen Bannon and Jared Kushner make their way to Carrier Corporation in Indianapolis, Ind., in December. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) In other cases, it\u2019s unclear whether the usual safeguards of public disclosure and divestment will come into play to prevent those serving the president from profiting personally from their work. The concerns have been amplified by the fact that they will be reporting to a Republican president who has been slow to address the potential conflicts stemming from his own real estate holdings and other business interests. Some of the advisory roles Trump has set up or is openly contemplating fall into \u201cvery murky territory,\u201d said Norman Eisen, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer under President Obama. Richard W. Painter, who held the same position as Eisen under President George W. Bush and now sits with him on the board of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said \u201cit poses an enormous risk to have a shadow Cabinet.\u201d Trump transition officials did not respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Icahn said he will \u201cfollow the law as he always has,\u201d while Kushner\u2019s attorney said he is consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take. The appointment of Icahn \u2014 whom Trump praised as \u201csomeone who is innately able to predict the future, especially having to do with finances and economies\u201d \u2014 has drawn the sharpest criticism. Painter said Icahn\u2019s status as an unpaid adviser is \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d The billionaire investor made his name on Wall Street as one of the most successful corporate raiders of the 1980s, including making nearly $500\u00a0million from his stake in Trans World Airlines. As an investor in Trump\u2019s hotels, he has clashed with the president-elect over business deals in the past but also provided financing at critical moments to keep Trump afloat. Icahn ranks among the 50 richest people in the world, according to Forbes. In the wee hours after Election Day, as supporters celebrated Trump\u2019s victory in a ballroom at the New York Hilton in Midtown Manhattan, Icahn ducked out of the festivities. He was tracking the initial plunge in financial markets over Trump\u2019s upset win and decided to make a bet. \u201cI couldn\u2019t put more than $1\u00a0billion to work,\u201d Icahn told Bloomberg TV the day after the election. \u201cThe world was going into a panic for no reason. I think Donald coming in is a good thing for the economy, not a bad thing.\u201d Trump\u2019s presidency also stands to be particularly good for Icahn. He has long railed against regulation from Washington, most recently in the energy sector. Now he is being tasked by Trump to help him slash government regulations in the newly created role of special adviser for regulatory reform. Trump\u2019s transition team emphasized that the title comes with no official duties and no salary \u2014 and is therefore not subject to federal disclosure requirements or conflict of interest laws. In an interview on CNBC, Icahn said that he will simply be \u201ctalking to Donald as I\u2019ve talked before.\u201d The confirmation process is designed in part to air potential conflicts. For example, Trump\u2019s incoming commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, who made a fortune in the steel industry, will likely be asked to explain how he will oversee a department that has significant oversight of that sector. While White House staff members do not face confirmation hearings as Cabinet secretaries do, they must file disclosure forms revealing their finances. They also have to divest assets that create conflicts of interest or abide by rules requiring them to recuse themselves from decisions that could affect those assets. Icahn\u2019s role is so nebulous that it is difficult to tell how it should be categorized. The nature of his work could make him a de facto government employee \u2014 subject to disclosure requirements and conflict of interest laws \u2014 even if he is not paid. \u201cIs it in the public interest for him to take that position and for us to not know what he\u2019s doing?\u201d said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. Watchdog groups have raised concerns about how much influence Icahn might wield over rolling back regulations that could benefit him personally. In the CNBC interview, he expounded at length over what he deemed \u201cinsane\u201d rules dictating how much ethanol refineries should blend into gasoline. Shares of CVR Energy, a petroleum refinery in which he holds a significant stake, have almost doubled in price since the election. In addition, it is unclear whether Icahn\u2019s position could provide him special access to political intelligence. Legislation passed in 2012 prohibits members of Congress and certain positions within the executive branch from trading based on nonpublic political information. Democrats are already questioning whether Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, violated that law by trading health-care stocks during the crafting of the Affordable Care Act. Trump\u2019s unusual willingness to intervene in the business decisions of individual companies could also create greater potential for conflicts of interest. On Thursday, Trump criticized Toyota for building cars in Mexico and selling them in the United States, sending the company\u2019s stock plunging. \u201cThe fear would be that he could be privy to knowledge that could affect the market in some ways or different corporations he has a stake in or against,\u201d said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \u201cHe could make a move before the rest of America knows about it.\u201d In an email, Jesse Lynn, general counsel of Icahn Enterprises, said Icahn\u2019s title was not intended to formalize his role in the new Trump administration but to acknowledge the long-standing relationship among two New York dealmakers. Jan Baran, a campaign and elections lawyer at Wiley Rein, said conflict of interest laws only cover information that has the potential to affect a specific company, not a broad industry. And he said that many presidents often have a coterie of unofficial advisers, many of whom lack real power. \u201cIt kind of reminds me of Peter the Great when he was the czar of Russia\u201d in the late 1600s and early 1700s, Baran said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have much in the way of money that he could give to anybody, so he started giving blue ribbons. This might be Trump\u2019s version of a blue ribbon.\u201d Trump has not made formal announcements about the role his daughter and son-in-law will play in the administration. But those around him have suggested that Ivanka Trump could be involved in policies affecting working mothers, while Kushner\u2019s portfolio could include advising the president on foreign policy, particularly the Middle East. What would happen to their business interests remains unclear. Ivanka Trump has played a leading role in her father\u2019s business and has a clothing line. Kushner has a web of business interests of his own, focused heavily on real estate development. Though Kushner\u2019s company is focused primarily on development in New York and New Jersey, it has often relied on foreign investment, and its earnings could be influenced by Trump administration trade and foreign relations policies. Kushner\u2019s lawyer, WilmerHale partner Jamie Gorelick, said Saturday that Kushner would recuse himself from matters that would have a direct impact on his remaining financial interests and abide by other federal ethics rules. A federal anti-nepotism statute enacted in 1967 could also complicate the fate of the couple, who recently purchased a house in Washington. The law, which came about after President John F. Kennedy named his brother as attorney general, forbids public officials from hiring family members in agencies or offices they oversee. There\u2019s some disagreement among lawyers as to whether appointments to White House positions are exempt \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in the health-care reform proposal during her husband\u2019s presidency is cited by those who take that view. Gorelick declined to comment on that matter. But both Eisen and Painter say they counseled their respective presidents to avoid appointing relatives to administration positions. Painter argued that the ideal solution \u2014 if Trump wants to put his daughter and son-in-law in positions of influence \u2014 would be to ask Congress to amend the anti-nepotism law and give them formal roles. Lewandowski remains in regular touch with the president-elect and is expected to continue to do so when Trump enters the Oval Office. There is a long tradition in Washington of lobbyists trading on their access to powerful figures, but ethics experts were taken aback by how bluntly Lewandowski pitched his new lobbying shop. A news release issued by the firm, Avenue Strategies, touted its location \u201cjust a block from the White House\u201d on Pennsylvania Avenue and quoted Lewandowski saying, \u201cI will always be President-elect Trump\u2019s biggest supporter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been overly desensitized to shock, but we should be shocked,\u201d Eisen said. \u201cHow did Trump not repudiate that announcement?\u201d Eisen asked. \u201cI think he should repudiate it. I doubt he will.\u201d Chico Harlan contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

The United States' Environmental Protection Agency considers an Air Quality Index between 0-50 to be \"Good.\" Since the smog alert was raised on Dec. 31, Beijing has skirted on the edge of 300 and regularly surpassed it as it did on Jan. 3 when the Air Quality Index breached 700. For comparison, the Air Quality Index measured by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on Jan. 6 was at 298 , considered \"Very Unhealthy,\" on the same day in New York City the Air Quality Index measured 43 or \"Good.\" Winter is typically the most polluted season in China because the country burns more coal to power heaters. Manufacturers also often increase production ahead of the Chinese New Year, this year it will be on Jan. 28, also increasing pollution levels. Cold air inversions during the winter months can also trap smog lower to the surface. Cities under red alert must take measures to limit pollution \u2014 like limiting the number of cars on the roads and halting construction and factory production. Schools are also closed while residents are urged to stay in-doors and avoid physical outdoor activity. A woman wearing a mask walks past a construction site as smog continues to choke Beijing on Jan. 6, 2017. Ng Han Guan / AP For Maggie Li, the mother of a 5-year-old kindergartner in Beijing, every morning in 2017 has started with the same question: How do I get my child safely to school? \"There is nothing else I can do, I put a mask on my boy, but he was so frustrated because he could hardly breathe,\" Li told NBC News. Li bemoaned that the pollution has only grown worse over the years. \"I've been living here in Beijing for 40 years, so it is really hard for me to leave. But I do miss the blue skies from when I was a kid, the blue sky that my kid barely sees.\" Short, intense periods of bad air are commonplace in Beijing \u2014 but the fact that city has now been under \"orange alert\" since Dec. 31 is frustrating locals. \"I think it is pathetic that we have to purify the air with our own lungs, or wait for the wind,\" said Beijing resident Xu Huiren. \"The smog has been here since October and nothing is really improved till now. I feel like nobody is working for environmental protection.\" Even Chinese state media has been critical over the smog, with the reliably nationalist Global Times newspaper noting in an article on Jan. 4 that, \"the heavy smog has also been corroding the government's credibility.\" Beijing is well aware of the growing public backlash on air pollution. It is currently in the third year of a public campaign against smog as it tries to walk back environmental damage caused by three decades of breakneck economic development. While organizations like Greenpeace report some progress has been made in cleaning up the air, China's own Ministry of Environmental Protection reports nearly 62% of Chinese cities are still coping with severe air pollution. In a nod to the growing concerns of parents in the region and the outrage starting to spill into Chinese society, the Beijing city government announced Jan. 6 in local media that a new initiative was being started to fund the installation of air purifiers in kindergartens, primary and middle schools in the capital. The move will likely mollify families, many of whom have already invested thousands of dollars in their own home air purifying systems and masks to combat pollution at home. Despite the air pollution and the need for extreme precautionary measures, many \u2014 like the student Jiang who wears a face mask \u2014 plan to stay in Beijing because job prospects are still good. \"Today I just want to work hard and have no intention of leaving Beijing,\" said Jiang. \"But in the future when I have children if there is no sign of environment improvement here, I will consider moving somewhere else.\" NBC News' Dawn Liu and Sami Tseng contributed to this report.

    "text": "Travelers lose 25,000 items after Florida airport rampage Published               January 08, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2013 \u00a0Dan and Janice Kovacs and their two children were passing through airport security when the gunfire erupted. They were shoeless \u2014 with wallets, passports and carry-on items chugging along a conveyer belt \u2014 when they sprang into the mass of people running to safety. Now they're among stranded travelers at Fort Lauderdale trying to recover what the airport director says are 25,000 pieces of luggage, cellphones and other belongings separated from their owners during Friday's shooting rampage. \"We have no IDs, we have no passports, no money,\" Janice, 39, said Saturday afternoon, wearing sandals borrowed from a brother-in-law. \"We just had to leave our stuff and run.\" \"All our stuff is being processed. We might not even get that until Monday. I have an 11-year-old who is freaking out. This has been traumatic for her,\" she said. The shooting Friday afternoon, which killed five people and wounded six, also stranded about 12,000 outgoing and incoming travelers, many returning from cruises or arriving ahead of the usual Saturday departures of the massive ships based in the tourism hub's Port Everglades terminal. Some travelers were kept on planes for more than seven hours while police put the airport on lockdown; others scrambled to protected corners or were hustled out onto the tarmac. The Kovacs, on the way home to Vancouver, British Columbia, after a Caribbean cruise, went out onto that rough surface barefoot. The Florida Highway Patrol sent computer-equipped buses to the airport Saturday afternoon to issue temporary ID cards to help travelers get out of state and even abroad. \"We are doing what we can to help,\" Sgt. Mark Wysocki said. Sydney Rivera, a 21-year-old Purdue University student, received a temporary Florida identification card that is nearly identical to the state's driver's license. On Friday, she had been about to board a flight home to Indianapolis in another terminal when people scattered over false fears of a second shooter. \"This will make it a lot easier to get through security,\" Rivera said as she rushed to finally catch a flight. Gov. Rick Scott said cruise ship companies were asked to accept travelers with provisional IDs. Once authorities began allowing travelers to depart the airport Friday evening, buses took thousands of them to the cruise terminal. Airport spokesman Greg Meyer said most bags won't be available until Monday. The airport hired an outside firm to collect discarded bags and sort them by where they were found so they can be identified by their owners. Those with lost luggage were told to call a toll-free number. But there were exceptions as airport officials scrambled to work with individuals. Jessie Khalastchi, a 21-year-old college student from London, left her carry-on bag and laptop that contained a paper for school when she fled the gunfire. She was reunited with her belongings Saturday afternoon, just in time to catch a flight out of Miami. The Kovacs also received some of their luggage late Saturday but were still waiting for their IDs, cellphones, passports and wallets. Richard Lanbry, his wife and 15-year-old daughter were about to board a plane home for Montreal when the shooting began. Amid the commotion, he was separated from the other two and frantically searched for them for about an hour. \"I was pushed down, my wife was pushed down too. It was violent ... people screaming, people crying, old and young. It was very scary,\" said the 61-year-old, who was vacationing in Pompano Beach. On top of that, they now have no luggage, no keys to their home and no coats or sweaters to wear once they arrive in chilly Montreal, only the T-shirts they we wearing the day before. Larry and Joy Edwards were about to board their flight home to Columbus, Ohio, after a Caribbean cruise. They ran out the skyway and down stairs onto the tarmac, where they were told to drop their carry-on bags and dash out to the runway. They eventually were taken to a hangar and bused to Port Everglades. That's where they spent most of the night. \"The Red Cross came. They gave us food and blankets and pillows. Everybody did what they could,\" Joy Edwards said. At 4:30 a.m., they were bused to a Miami motel. They had come back to the airport in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve their luggage, which contained their passports, medicine and other essentials. Larry Edwards, a retired electric lineman, said they won't be able to get home until Monday and pointed to the clothes they had put on Friday morning. \"All we have is this and our smelly selves,\" he said.

The matter could have been settled for what amounts to pocket change for a billionaire, but the Trump Organization decided to take its chances in court. Now Trump stands to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if he wins, it could force a small businessman \u2014 one of hundreds who say they were stiffed by Trump over the years \u2014 possibly into bankruptcy. That businessman, Juan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, won the first round of the legal skirmish last summer when a judge found a lien he slapped on the Trump National Doral golf resort was valid. Play Senate Democrats Prepare for Marathon Week of Confirmation Hearings 1:33 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170109000453if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/850367555884\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The court ordered Trump to pay for $32,000 worth of paint, plus nearly $300,000 in legal fees. Trump's company appealed, and barring a last-minute resolution, the case will be pending when he takes office; the deadline for final briefs is two days before he becomes the most powerful person in America. Enriquez's lawyer, Daniel Vega, said he is not surprised it has gone this far. \"The Trump litigation team litigated this case from day one like lions on fresh meat and continue to do so now on appeal,\" he told NBC News. The matter dates back to the fall of 2013 when Enriquez, who owns three Miami paint stores, was tapped by a subcontractor to supply paint for a major remodeling project at the Doral resort, owned and operated by a Trump company called Trump Endeavor. The Trump National Doral clubhouse March 7, 2016 in Doral, Florida. Wilfredo Lee / AP There is no dispute that the paint was delivered and used on the property, according to court records. But after the subcontractor walked off the job weeks before completion, Enriquez didn't get a final payment. In a deposition, a project manager for general contractor Straticon testified that he failed to get the Trump Organization to pay the balance. \"Were you trying to pay him,\" Vega asked the manager, Jamie Gram, during the sessions. \"I was,\" Gram replied. \"Somebody chose not to,\" Gram said. \"Who?\" the lawyer asked. \"The Trump Organization,\" Gram said. \"Who at Trump?\" \"I don't know,\" Gram said. \"Mr. Trump. Donald Trump.\" In October 2014, Enriquez filed a lien \u2014 a legal tool that can be used to recover a debt by tying up a piece of property \u2014 against Doral. Eight months later, Enriquez filed a lawsuit against Trump Endeavor, seeking to foreclose on the 800-acre resort. Then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump drives himself around the golf course on March 6, 2016, in Doral, Florida. Luis M. Alvarez / AP The Trump team's defense was largely technical. It turned out that when Enriquez took the job he submitted paperwork called a Notice to Owner, which would allow him to file a lien against the property if a bill wasn't paid. A Trump official gave him a form to work off \u2014 but it listed the general contractor for a different part of the project, and Enriquez repeated the mistake on his notice. Gram later noticed and flagged the error. Enriquez said he would fix it but never did, court documents show. At trial, though, Gram testified that the decision not to pay Enriquez \"had nothing to do with a defective notice to owner.\" He went on to explain that the bill went unpaid because the Trump Organization had already paid \"a decent amount of money\" to the subcontractor, M&P, before it abandoned the job. The resort used any money left over, plus additional funds, to complete the unfinished paint job, he said. Gram's testimony appeared to distress Trump's legal team, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Jorge Cueto noted in his June 2016 ruling. \"When Mr. Gram made that admission, Trump's trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily and attempted to make eye contact with him,\" the judge wrote. The judge found that Enriquez had made \"diligent efforts\" to comply with the lien law and that being given the wrong paperwork by the Trump official was the root of the mistake. He also dismissed Trump clams that the bill was fraudulent, subtracting only $76.39 for a stepladder from the bottom line. Cueto then dealt the Trump team a bigger blow, ruling that they had to pay Enriquez's legal costs. Because Vega had taken the case on contingency, meaning he would not get paid if they lost, the judge tacked on a multiplier to compensate him for the risk he took, nearly doubling the award to $283,949.91. \"Trump elected to fight this case 'tooth and nail' instead of resolving it for a reasonable amount, driving up Paint Spot's litigation fees and costs,\" the judge explained.

The massive storm is expected to bring massive amounts of rainfall and tropical storm-force winds from the coast inland to Nevada. The extent of injuries from the storm is not yet clear, but officials said at least one woman was killed by a falling tree amid high winds. CBS San Francisco reports the woman was killed by the falling tree while walking on a San Ramon golf course on Saturday. The victim\u2019s identity has not yet been released. Crews in California cleared trees and debris following mudslides caused by steady rain accompanying the system that could dump 15 inches in foothill areas as it gained strength throughout the day.\u00a0 Reno officials reported the city has already been experiencing mass flooding and road closures, reports CBS Reno affiliate KTVN . More than 1,000 homes have been evacuated in Reno. Emergency officials said residents voluntarily evacuated a total of 1,300 homes in a south Reno neighborhood Sunday as the Truckee River began to leave its banks and drainage ditches started to overflow south of Interstate 80. Many area roads have been closed, but no injuries have been reported. Several feet of snow was expected at higher elevations in the Sierra Nevada, as well as blistering winds. CBS Sacramento reports wind speeds of 150 mph were recorded in the Sierras.

Several feet away was Purcell\u2019s gray sedan, crushed under the weight of a massive tree that came tumbling down during Sunday\u2019s blustery winter storm, CBS San Francisco reported .\u00a0 \u201cI heard a large crack and then someone outside yelled out an expletive,\u201d he said. \u201cI ran outside and it was my car.\u201d Authorities reported rescues in Marin and Sonoma counties, including an operation along U.S. 101 where several people were plucked from submerged vehicles. No injuries were reported.\u00a0 A \u201cclosed\u201d sign stands at the entrance of a normally busy ice rink at the Half Dome Village of Yosemite National Park, Calif., on Saturday, Jan 7, 2016.\u00a0 GARY KAZANJIAN, AP Officials urged residents to avoid driving through standing water and to stay off rural roads, where rescues could be difficult. All roads leading to Yosemite National Park\u2019s valley floor remained closed amid fears that the Merced River could overflow its banks and cause major flooding. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal how empty the park is. There\u2019s nobody here,\u201d said Gary Kazanjian, a freelance photographer who spent the night in Yosemite and drove out Sunday as part of a caravan of stragglers.\u00a0 CBS San Francisco reports that the storm also has led to an awesome display of Mother Nature\u2019s power as the park\u2019s signature falls roared to life. The torrential rains had park officials casting a wary eye on the rising waters of the Merced River. The National Weather Service predicted the river would crest at the Pohono Bridge inside the park at least 15.6 feet by Sunday night \u2014 well over the flood stage of 10 feet. Authorities were watching rising water levels of several Northern California rivers, including the Cosumnes, Truckee, American and Russian. Forecasters also warned of strong winds. A woman was killed Saturday by a falling tree on a San Francisco Bay Area golf course. Firefighters on Sunday rescued a man pinned under a toppled tree in Golden Gate Park. The homeless man had minor injuries and was taken to a hospital to be checked.\u00a0 Snow is cleared from the Donner Pass rest area at Donner Pass summit during a winter storm, near Truckee, California, U.S. January 7, 2017. REUTERS The storm surge stretching all the way from Hawaii -- called an atmospheric river -- comes as California enters its sixth year of drought. Each drop of rain is welcomed, but officials said several more big storms are needed to replenish depleted groundwater supplies. The strong wet season began in October with more rain falling than in three decades, mostly in Northern California. Los Angeles, which will likely get the brunt of the latest system early Monday, is experiencing its wettest winter in six years, forecasters said. The storm\u2019s relatively mild temperatures will drive up the snowline to above 9,000 feet throughout the Sierra Nevada, causing runoff in the lower elevations, said Zach Tolby, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada.\u00a0 Flooding could rival the winter of 2005-06 that sent 5 feet of water into an industrial area in Sparks, Nevada. Crews worked to secure storage drums filled with hazardous materials to stop them from floating away as they have in past floods. Another storm is forecast for Tuesday and with the ground already saturated, rain won\u2019t seep into the soil quickly enough and extra runoff could end up in already swollen rivers and creeks, officials said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

We haven't even come in yet,\" said Austan Goolsbee, a professor at the University of Chicago, who was a top economic adviser in the early years of the Obama presidency. Goolsbee said there were two schools of thought about how to proceed. \"Doing something on the order of magnitude of the problem, which everyone understood is going to be a collection of a whole bunch of things and you're going to have a hard time explaining it,\" Goolsbee said was one option. Or, he said, others argued, \" 'Couldn't we just pick one thing and just do that one thing?' And that would be really easy to explain.\" The economy was hemorrhaging jobs, and Obama's economic team was afraid the country was on the brink of another Great Depression. The president chose to go big. Article continues after sponsorship Michelle Obama's Emotional Farewell: 'The Power Of Hope' Has 'Allowed Us To Rise' Obama came into the White House eight years ago, hailed as the \"Great Communicator\" because of his lofty speeches, but as he leaves office \u2014 and delivers a farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago \u2014 by his own admission, Obama hasn't always been so adept at communicating his policies and achievements. He struggled to make the sell on the Recovery Act (known as the stimulus), the auto bailout and the Affordable Care Act. The man who will succeed him has chosen a decidedly different path. President-elect Donald Trump has on multiple occasions hyped up announcements by companies that they will add a few thousand or even fewer jobs, declaring victory and getting lots of attention for relatively small wins, as compared to the size of the U.S. economy. Obama has overseen 75 straight months of job growth. Employers added millions of jobs during the course of his presidency, but Obama hasn't been able to capitalize on that politically as well as his allies would have hoped. Biden To Democrats Objecting To Electoral College Results: 'It Is Over' Obama signed the Recovery Act in February 2009. And, in the speech he made that day, the challenges of explaining the behemoth $780 billion package were clear. \"Today does mark the beginning of the end,\" Obama said, \"the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for Americans scrambling in the wake of layoffs.\" He talked about the millions of jobs it would \"save or create,\" a metric so squishy it proved hard for Obama to claim credit for it later and made it easy for opponents to criticize the stimulus as a failure. He spent most of the speech talking about \"investments.\" \"Rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our faulty dams and levees, bringing critical broadband connections to businesses and homes in nearly every community in America,\" Obama said in what was a long list of projects. \"Upgrading mass transit.\" But Frank Luntz, who has advised Republicans on messaging, said in an interview with NPR, the word \"investment\" can sound, for some, like code for big-government spending. On Intelligence And Russian Hacking, Are Trump And His Team Missing The Point? \"There was real hostility early on,\" Luntz said, \"a feeling that it's just an expansion of Washington and nobody was going to benefit and everyone was going to get stuck with the tab.\" Obama's team overestimated Americans' appetite for stimulus spending, Luntz argued. Republicans in Congress, who never supported the Recovery Act, repeatedly derided it as a \"failed trillion-dollar stimulus.\" In reality, a big chunk of it went to tax cuts \u2014 and it helped pull the country out of the biggest recession since the Great Depression. In Obama's bill-signing speech, the mention of those tax cuts came near the end. \"About a third of this package comes in the forms of tax cuts \u2014 by the way, the most progressive in our history,\" said Obama to applause, arguing it would not only spur job creation, but put \"money in the pockets of 95 percent of hard-working families in America.\" Working 3 Jobs In A Time Of Recovery The way the tax cuts were distributed also limited any public relations benefit. The money just appeared in people's paychecks as a smaller payroll tax deduction. \"Nobody realized, nobody understood and, so, nobody celebrated it,\" Luntz said. \"There's a simple rule in politics: if you don't talk about it, no one knows you did it, and you get no credit for it. And that was the problem with the tax-cut component of Obama's stimulus package.\" The tax cut was carefully designed by the Obama administration to target low- and middle-income Americans. But it ultimately had little traction with the public \u2014 or with Republicans whom it was intended to help sway. \"At one point in the first year,\" Goolsbee said, remembering a moment of great frustration, \"there's a poll that comes out in which something like 60 percent of the country said that they were sick of the tax increases that had come from the stimulus, when, in fact, 95 percent had gone down.\" Goolsbee said that is when he began to realize that reality was relative \u2014 something that has truly taken hold in American politics now. \"And at that point, you know the president was basically asking the economic team, 'What is wrong with you people?' and I just felt like punching myself,\" said Goolsbee with a laugh. Economists widely view the stimulus as having helped the economy avoid disaster. But politically, Obama got none of the credit for the tax cuts and a whole lot of grief for the spending. This was a pattern that would repeat itself throughout his presidency. As Trump prepares to enter the White House, his communications strategy is one of mass saturation, including rapid-fire tweets on multiple topics. Will that work out better than Obama's cool focus on facts and figures when trying to persuade the public? Or as he works to repeal some of Obama's policy achievements, will he have to adopt a different tactic to sell his proposals? ",

    "text": "\u201cFrom the parts of the report I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as Tea Party favorite, \u201cit seems silly.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are genuine concerns about Russia\u2019s cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.) Of the comments he had seen from fellow Trump supporters on Facebook and in emails, he added, \u201c90 percent of them are like, \u2018What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019\u201d The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in American elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries\u2019 elections. Even if the Russians did do it \u2014 which some were more willing to concede than others \u2014 what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, \u201cjust being sore losers.\u201d Photo Paul Emenes: As long as Donald J. Trump wasn\u2019t involved, \u201cit doesn\u2019t change the way I view him.\u201d Credit William Widmer for The New York Times \u201cI don\u2019t think the Russians posed as big a problem to the Clintons as the Clintons posed to themselves,\u201d said Paul Emenes, 49, while he sold ribs, shoulders and chops at a frigid outdoor farmers\u2019 market in Covington. Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Mr. Emenes said. He added that, as long as Mr. Trump was not involved himself, \u201cit doesn\u2019t change the way I view him.\u201d Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, La., front yard after the previous night\u2019s frost, had a similar attitude. \u201cTrump is Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cDo I think he\u2019s going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don\u2019t. I think \u2014 I hope \u2014 his focus will be on making America great again.\u201d Ms. Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. \u201cWhy would Putin even want Trump?\u201d Photo Tina Gunaldo, on Mr. Trump: \u201cI think \u2014 I hope \u2014 his focus will be on making America great again.\u201d Credit William Widmer for The New York Times Mr. Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Mr. Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Obama might do before he leaves office. Advertisement It was Mr. Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Mr. Putin get away with things, Mr. Yates continued. Mr. Trump would be much tougher. But Mr. Yates then added: \u201cWhy is everybody so afraid of Russia? I\u2019m not against Putin.\u201d This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was \u201ca basket case,\u201d and not the powerful foe it once was, said Mr. Marino, from his seat at McDonald\u2019s. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Ind. Ms. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as \u201csomewhere in the middle\u201d between friend and enemy, but agreed with Mr. Trump that the United States could work with them to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. \u201cWe may have to line up with people who may not be our \u2018friend\u2019 to make that happen,\u201d she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the Central Intelligence Agency. Photo Thurston Yates, on the intelligence report: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Why would Putin even want Trump?\u201d Credit William Widmer for The New York Times As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. \u201cThe idea of a fair election\u201d had been placed in doubt, Ms. Willis said. \u201cWe were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you\u2019re talking about espionage.\u201d The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Senator John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cOur president being in cahoots with the Russian government?\u201d Mr. Willis said. \u201cYes, I\u2019m very concerned about that.\u201d In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56, chain-smoked Eagle 20 cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Mr. Gubert came to a different conclusion. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d Campbell Robertson reported from Covington, La., and Mitch Smith from Valparaiso, Ind.

Listen as Emma Stone shows off her singing talent in this romantic musical with an old-Hollywood feel. USA TODAY NETWORK Andr\u00e9 Holland (left) and Trevante Rhodes star in the coming-of-age drama 'Moonlight.' (Photo: David Bornfriend) Awards season kicks into another gear this weekend\u00a0at the 74th annual Golden Globes, where the Hollywood Foreign Press Association fetes its favorite films \u2014 and we get the first glimpse at what could be true Oscar contenders.\u00a0USA TODAY predicts who will win and suggests who should win\u00a0in the top movie categories at the ceremony emceed by Jimmy Fallon\u00a0(NBC, Sunday, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT). Drama Will win:\u00a0Moonlight Should win:\u00a0Manchester by the Sea Without front-runner\u00a0La La Land in the mix, we'll get to see its major Oscar best-picture competition take home some gold \u2014 most likely\u00a0Moonlight, the acclaimed character study following the life of a gay black man. Yet Manchester, a drama about a New England family beset by tragedy, is the real standout of this pack\u00a0with its emotional power. The L.A. freeway becomes ground zero for the opening dance number of 'La La Land.' \u00a0(Photo: Dale Robinette) Sing Street Will win/should win:\u00a0La La Land Deadpool's appearance here gives the ceremony\u00a0some novelty, and if this was \"best coming-of-age '80s Irish musical,\" Sing Street would rule the category.\u00a0Instead, expect the vaunted La La Land to sing and dance the night away with a new trophy. Casey Affleck is a handyman who returns to his New England hometown in 'Manchester by the Sea.' \u00a0(Photo: Claire Folger) Casey Affleck,\u00a0Manchester by the Sea Joel Edgerton,\u00a0Loving Denzel Washington,\u00a0Fences Will win/should win: Casey Affleck The foreign press loves big names,\u00a0so Washington has a shot\u00a0as Fences' domineering former baseball star.\u00a0Just as 2016\u00a0was Leonardo DiCaprio's turn to round the bases toward Oscar glory, though, now it's Casey at the bat \u2014 and deservedly so, since Affleck smacks a homer with\u00a0Manchester's most\u00a0heartbreaking and multilayered performance. Natalie Portman plays the title first lady of 'Jackie.' \u00a0(Photo: Bill Gray) Will win:\u00a0Isabelle Huppert Should win:\u00a0Natalie Portman Playing first lady Jackie Kennedy in the turmoil following JFK's\u00a0assassination, Portman's effort is a thing of beauty. But an American icon may not resonate as much with the HFPA, so Huppert is a worthy upset pick: The French actress' complicated rape victim is the best part about the psychological thriller Elle. Colin Farrell stars as a man hoping to find love before he's turned into a crustacean in 'The Lobster.' \u00a0(Photo: Despina Spyrou) Ryan Gosling,\u00a0La La Land Hugh Grant,\u00a0Florence Foster Jenkins Jonah Hill,\u00a0War Dogs Will win:\u00a0Ryan Gosling Should win:\u00a0Colin Farrell Most of the heavyweights are in the drama category so Gosling should have a clear path hoofing it to victory\u00a0as La La Land's romantically crabby\u00a0jazz man. Worth consideration, on other hand, is the quirky nuance Farrell exhibits in the The Lobster as a man doomed to life as a\u00a0crustacean if he doesn't find love in 45 days. Emma Stone stars as an aspiring actress with a story to tell in 'La La Land.' \u00a0(Photo: Lionsgate) Annette Bening,\u00a020th Century Women Lily Collins,\u00a0Rules Don't Apply Hailee Steinfeld,\u00a0The Edge of Seventeen Emma Stone,\u00a0La La Land Meryl Streep,\u00a0Florence Foster Jenkins Will win/should win:\u00a0Emma Stone The category runs the gamut of\u00a0young talent and veteran thespians, with Steinfeld standing toe to toe with\u00a0legends like Bening and\u00a0Streep. The head of this class? Stone, whose aspiring actress finding love in La La Land gives the Hollywood musical its heart, soul and even a literal showstopper. Mahershala Ali stars as a drug-dealing father figure in 'Moonlight.' \u00a0(Photo: David Bornfriend) Jeff Bridges,\u00a0Hell or High Water Simon Helberg,\u00a0Florence Foster Jenkins Dev Patel,\u00a0Lion Aaron Taylor-Johnson,\u00a0Nocturnal Animals Will win/should win:\u00a0Mahershala Ali Bridges' High Water Texas Ranger\u00a0is a hoot and Patel's Lion journey is a weepy one, but this is Ali's Globe to lose. While only in a third of Moonlight, he showcases skill and artistry as a kindhearted drug dealer who becomes a father figure for an outcast boy. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis play a working-class Pittsburgh couple in 'Fences.' \u00a0(Photo: David Lee) Michelle Williams,\u00a0Manchester by the Sea Will win/should win:\u00a0Viola Davis It's the most talent-packed category of them all \u2014 as well as the most diverse. All five actresses are knockouts playing parents in a variety of emotional circumstances, personal and\u00a0professional, but Davis is next level as a 1950s mom who lives a calm home life until raging against patriarchal repression.

(Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) Several of the thousands who lined up Jan. 7, 2017, for tickets to President Barack Obama's farewell speech, to be held Jan. 10 in Chicago, share their thoughts on what the presidency meant to them. (Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) Tony Briscoe Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune While President Barack Obama 's farewell address was intended to be a free event for those hoping to hear his final oration as commander in chief, there appears to be no shortage of people looking to make a profit from the historic occasion. Obama, a former U.S. senator turned two-term president, will deliver his last presidential speech Tuesday evening at Chicago's McCormick Place. Free tickets were available on a first-come, first-served basis Saturday morning, prompting several thousand people to withstand single-digit temperatures to wait in line for tickets. By 7 a.m., Chicago police officials were warning hopefuls not already in line not to bother. The crowds had grown so large that all of the available tickets would be scooped up. By Sunday, advertisements to auction dozens of the elusive tickets had sprouted up on secondary market websites like eBay and Craigslist asking for as much as $5,000 apiece. Left unclear, however, was whether those tickets were legitimate or could be legally sold. Steve Bernas, Better Business Bureau of Chicago and Northern Illinois president, strongly warned against buying tickets. Whether its tickets to a Cubs game or the musical \"Hamilton,\" there are invariably reports of counterfeit tickets and other hoaxes, he said. \"Stay away from anyone selling these tickets,\" he said. \"You don't know who these people are. It's different buying a couch on Craigslist. You can see the couch. ... There's no way to verify these tickets.\" Though there were no complaints of fraud related to the Obama farewell as of Sunday, Bernas said generally people won't know they've been scammed until ushers stop them at the door. Bernas said it was unlikely police would pursue scalpers. Thousands lined up early on Jan 7, 2017, in the bitter cold for a shot at a free ticket to President Barack Obama's\u00a0farewell speech, which he will deliver\u00a0Jan. 10 at McCormick Place. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) \"Someone is always looking to make a profit on a situation, disaster or calamity,\" Bernas said. \"I guarantee someone will be turned away on Tuesday.\" Bernas also cautioned those who plan on attending the event against sharing pictures of tickets on social media. Scammers, he said, might be able to duplicate them as a result. Images of the tickets posted in some ads appeared to match those that people snagged Saturday. Those same images also had fine print clearly saying the tickets were \"not for sale or re-sale.\" Spokespeople for the White House and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, which owns and operates McCormick Place, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. John Holden, 55, of Edgewater, booked a hotel near McCormick Place in anticipation of the ticket release. While standing in line for 21/2 hours to get his ticket, he remembers officials telling the crowd that the tickets were not for resale, but he didn't note any precautions to ensure that resales didn't take place.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Within days, he could be confirmed as attorney general of the United States. Some cabinet nominees arrive at confirmation hearings with records that require considerable guesswork. Not Mr. Sessions. His rock-ribbed conservatism was forged in the deep poverty and isolation of rural Alabama, sharpened during 16 years as a federal prosecutor and state attorney general and polished as a senator. After one of the most liberal periods in Justice Department history, Mr. Sessions is expected to execute an about-face on the Obama administration\u2019s policies of immigration, criminal justice and \u2014 many critics fear \u2014 civil rights. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He argues that immigrants are siphoning billions in welfare payments, committing crimes and snatching jobs from Americans. He has questioned whether the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States, as the 14th Amendment states, and has insisted that the First Amendment doctrine of separation of church and state has been too broadly interpreted. He declared same-sex marriage an indisputable threat to American culture and once went to court to deny funding for gay student groups. Overreaching by the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, he has said, at times has led to \u201ccivil wrongs.\u201d He favors stiff, mandatory penalties for drug offenses, believes that the government has grown soft on crime and objects to what he sees as unwarranted criticism of police behavior. Mr. Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, has been a consistent voice for conservative policies for nearly two decades in the Senate. Here are some of his positions on the issues. Mr. Sessions is not a uniquely conservative pick; John Ashcroft, attorney general under President George W. Bush, held similarly strident views. But Mr. Ashcroft was a party stalwart whom any number of Republican presidents might have nominated. Mr. Sessions offers an uncompromising brand of conservatism that combines Christian and small-government values with strains of populism and a willingness to say the unpopular, or even offensive. He speaks to a disenchanted electorate that includes the white, nationalistic fringes of his party. In short, he is a uniquely Trump nominee to lead the Justice Department. To many Trump supporters, he is a rare public servant with the backbone to enforce the nation\u2019s laws strictly, regardless of political consequences. \u201cHe has been the leader of this populist revolt against the political elite,\u201d Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News Network who will be a senior White House adviser, said in February. Critics see Mr. Sessions as a throwback to a bygone South. \u201cHis whole life, he has been on the wrong side of every issue,\u201d said Wayne Flynt, a politically progressive Alabama history professor who has followed his career for decades. On questions about voting, gays and immigration, he said, \u201che has argued to narrow democracy, not broaden it.\u201d The roots of his ideology, and the combination of independence and tenacity that has carried Mr. Sessions to this point, can be found in rural Alabama, where he grew up. A Strict Code Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III was named after his father, who was named after his grandfather, who was named after the Confederate president Jefferson Davis, his parents once said. Buddy, as he was called, grew up an only child on the ragged edge of Alabama\u2019s famous Black Belt in Hybart, a one-crossing hamlet where his father ran a store. The family lived in a one-story house with no driveway, a small concrete front stoop and a heating system consisting of a fireplace and space heaters. Birmingham had a steel industry. Mobile had a port. But around Hybart, work was limited mostly to logging or farming. Neighboring Wilcox County, home to the nearest town of any size and Mr. Sessions\u2019s high school, then was one of the nation\u2019s poorest. It still is. Photo A 1969 yearbook photo of Mr. Sessions as a student at Huntingdon College in Montgomery. He led the student government association and the Young Republicans club there. He learned thriftiness from his parents, who grew up during the Depression. Upon becoming a United States attorney in 1981, he had only $750 in the bank, records show. Friends joke that even after he attained the comfortable life of a senator decades later, he refused to replace an aging car or the outdated kitchen countertops at his home in Mobile. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was an environment that fostered Mr. Sessions\u2019s belief in frugality and self-reliance, bounded by a strict \u2014 if much disputed \u2014 code of what was and was not fair. It also bred, even early on, a skeptic\u2019s eye toward elites. His parents were longtime Republicans in a state that had been run by Democrats since Reconstruction. In high school, as racial politics laid the foundation for the eventual Republican takeover of the South, Mr. Sessions was fascinated by Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s book \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d a catechism on the split between the Republican Party establishment and its right wing. The book enjoined true conservatives to topple the party\u2019s kingmakers and compromisers, presaging the rise of the Tea Party and Mr. Trump \u2014 and now, Mr. Sessions himself. Unpopular ideas did not faze him, even as a schoolboy. His mother told one reporter, \u201cThat boy could argue with a signpost.\u201d His high school yearbook photo bore the caption: \u201cHe is a host of debaters in himself.\u201d Alabama\u2019s economic struggles helped define his political priorities. As a young man, he watched timber imports eat into local logging jobs, cheaper foreign steel hasten the closing of Birmingham mills, and immigrants take jobs in the fields and chicken processing plants. Most economists say those changes were largely unavoidable as the United States shifted from an economy based on manual labor to one rooted in services and knowledge. But Mr. Sessions saw a threat to the hard-working families he had grown up with, former aides said. To Alabama voters, weary of decades of Democratic back-scratching and scandals, Mr. Sessions seemed a breath of fresh air when he emerged on the political scene in 1994, after 12 years as the top federal prosecutor in Mobile. As the state\u2019s attorney general, his first elective post, he slashed staff, pay, travel, cars and supplies. Republican leaders hoped he would come to the rescue of the former governor, Guy Hunt, who was removed from office after a 1993 ethics conviction. Instead, Mr. Sessions asked a federal appeals court to uphold the conviction. The business-dominated establishment wing of Alabama\u2019s Republican Party is closer to the state\u2019s senior senator, Richard C. Shelby. Mr. Sessions\u2019s political base included rural and suburban working-class and evangelical white voters \u2014 the same constituencies that proved crucial to Mr. Trump\u2019s success in November. \u201cSessions had a Trump movement before there was a Trump,\u201d Professor Flynt, of Auburn University, said. His record as Alabama\u2019s attorney general \u2014 he served just two years before winning election to the Senate in 1996 \u2014 showcases his fiercely conservative views. Mr. Sessions supported reviving chain gangs of volunteer inmates. He defeated a court order that would have directed more state money to schools in poor districts by arguing that a single judge had usurped management of the entire state school system. He supported efforts to tighten identification requirements for Alabama voters and backed a county judge who posted the Ten Commandments in his courtroom and opened court with a daily prayer.

Credit Terry Ashe/The LIFE Images Collection, via Getty Images Alabama liked what it saw: Seeking his fourth term in 2014, Mr. Sessions was the only United States senator to run unopposed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hide who he is. He\u2019s a conservative guy,\u201d said former Senator Mark Pryor, a Democrat from Arkansas who once led the Senate\u2019s weekly prayer breakfast with Mr. Sessions. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t represent Massachusetts. He represents Alabama.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story But his rigid views and his willingness to buck the Republican leadership isolated him in the Senate. A fervent budget hawk, he was ready with his own spending plan when Republicans captured the Senate after the 2014 elections. But party leaders passed him over for chairmanship of the powerful Budget Committee, leaving him the longest-serving senator without a committee to lead. Former aides describe the decision as payback for Mr. Sessions\u2019s relentless opposition to bipartisan efforts to ease immigration restrictions. Republican purists like the radio host Rush Limbaugh said Senate power brokers were punishing a courageous truthsayer. \u201cThat alone tells you where the Republican leadership mind-set is on this,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said on his program in 2014. \u201cThey want to take out the one primary voice of opposition.\u201d Civil Rights There is perhaps only one area in which Mr. Sessions\u2019s views are in question. It is the source of his sole setback in four decades of public life and most of the controversy over his nomination. As Mr. Sessions attended his church youth group and worked toward the rank of Eagle Scout in the early 1960s, Alabama was emerging as ground zero of the civil rights movement, the backdrop for violence and bravery since immortalized in museums. But as he has himself suggested, the era\u2019s historic tumult largely escaped him. Segregation permeated the rural Alabama of his youth. As late as 1985, his father told a local paper that he believed in it, although he stressed he was not speaking for his son. Wilcox County High School, where Jeff Sessions was voted senior class president in 1964, was an all-white institution. African-Americans, the majority of county residents, were largely illiterate, living in unpainted wooden shacks insulated with newspapers, their children shunted to squalid schools with no instructional materials. In March of Mr. Sessions\u2019s senior year, demonstrators from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference came to town, demanding that African-Americans be allowed to register to vote. Police officers responded with tear gas and smoke bombs. The same month, state troopers armed with billy clubs attacked African-Americans as they began a historic march in Selma, 35 miles north of Wilcox County High. A few months later, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 opened the polls to African-Americans. The year after Mr. Sessions graduated, the Justice Department pried open the doors of Wilcox County schools for African-American students, winning a court judgment against a school board that had flatly declared that \u201cdesegregation is not good for education.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story By then, Mr. Sessions was a history major at Huntingdon College, a small, all-white Methodist school in Montgomery. He led the Young Republicans club \u2014 maybe a dozen students, including Mary Blackshear, whom he met on a hayride and married soon after graduation. \u201cEven though we were in Montgomery at a time when so much was going on, it was like we were in a little bubble or something,\u201d said Phebe Lee, a college friend and club member. Mr. Sessions acknowledged as much in February, at a congressional ceremony honoring the Selma marchers . \u201cAs a child and a teenager, I saw evidence of discrimination every day,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, I feel I should have stepped forward more.\u201d Mr. Sessions co-sponsored legislation awarding Alabama\u2019s civil rights marchers and Rosa Parks Congressional Gold Medals, but he has expressed mixed views about the Justice Department\u2019s enforcement of civil rights. In the mid-1980s, he called the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited racial discrimination at the polls, \u201can intrusive piece of legislation\u201d and said that federal judges of that era \u201ccan be criticized legally for exceeding jurisdiction.\u201d Photo Speaker Paul D. Ryan presenting a Congressional Gold Medal to Frederick Douglas Reese, at a ceremony in February honoring the Selma civil rights marchers. Mr. Sessions, far left, co-sponsored legislation awarding the marchers. Credit Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press On balance, he said, the law was necessary, and he voted with every other member of the Senate in 2006 to extend its provisions for another 25 years. But in 2013, after the Supreme Court invalidated one of the act\u2019s core provisions that required Justice Department approval to change election laws in places with histories of discrimination, he called it \u201cgood news, I think, for the South.\u201d Mr. Sessions has long accused the department of overstepping its authority by promoting minority rights that conservatives argue have no clear basis in law. \u201cThere is a perception, not altogether unjustified, that this department\u2019s Civil Rights Division goes beyond fair and balanced treatment, but has an agenda,\u201d Mr. Sessions said last year. \u201cThat\u2019s been a troubling issue for a number of years, frankly.\u201d Critics fear such comments presage a rollback in civil rights enforcement. \u201cJeff Sessions is emblematic of too many white Southerners who learned very little from the civil rights movement, except how to be more creative in carrying out an anti-civil-rights agenda,\u201d said Allen Tullos, a history professor at Emory University. Under President Obama, the Justice Department has threatened civil rights lawsuits to force police departments to change policies on the use of force, advocated gay rights and told local school districts to let transgender students use bathrooms that match their gender identity. Advocates and career prosecutors see a shift in the department\u2019s work on gay, lesbian and transgender issues as all but certain under Mr. Sessions. As Alabama\u2019s attorney general in the mid-1990s, he defended a state law barring funding for gay student groups on state college campuses, arguing that their very existence encouraged violation of state sodomy laws. A federal appeals court disagreed, striking down the law as \u201cblatant\u201d discrimination. In the Senate, he voted against making it a federal hate crime to attack people based on their sexual orientation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sessions has also questioned the use of consent decrees \u2014 one of the Justice Department\u2019s most powerful civil rights tools \u2014 as \u201can end run around the democratic process\u201d and a dangerous exercise of raw government power. The Obama administration has relied on consent decrees, in which local governments agree to make new policies to avoid battling the federal government in court, to transform police training, improve conditions in prisons and change how officers make arrests and use force. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see the Civil Rights Division go back to its more traditional role in terms of law enforcement,\u201d said Larry Thompson, a former deputy attorney general and longtime friend of Mr. Sessions. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to countenance a police officer shooting someone under color of law, but more than the current administration, he\u2019ll make sure to stand up for law-abiding citizens when one of these unfortunate situations occur.\u201d Mr. Sessions\u2019s last nomination to a federal post, a federal judgeship in 1986, foundered over questions by senators of both parties about his commitment to civil rights. Accounts of the nomination battle typically focus on testimony about a string of racially insensitive comments he was accused of making as a federal prosecutor. Those included statements \u2014 which he said were taken out of context but did not deny \u2014 that the N.A.A.C.P. and the American Civil Liberties Union were \u201cun-American\u201d groups that \u201cdo more harm than good.\u201d But perhaps most crucial to his rejection was his 1985 prosecution of three longtime black community activists on ballot-fixing charges. One was Albert Turner, an adviser to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and one of the Selma marchers attacked by state troopers. In 1984, Mr. Turner, his wife, Evelyn, and Spencer Hogue Jr. were working to elect a black candidate for local office over another African-American who, they believed, was in league with white politicians. A federal grand jury convened by Mr. Sessions\u2019s office charged them with 29 criminal counts for allegedly altering about two dozen absentee ballots without the voters\u2019 consent. Photo Albert Turner, left, with his wife, Evelyn, and Spencer Hogue Jr., and a redistricting map of Perry County, Ala. In 1984, a federal grand jury convened by Mr. Sessions\u2019s office charged each of them with 29 criminal counts for allegedly altering about two dozen absentee ballots without the voters\u2019 consent. They were acquitted. The case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among local African-Americans and among civil rights lawyers, who saw it as part of a broader effort by the Reagan administration\u2019s Justice Department to intimidate black voters. At trial, the case collapsed; most voters testified that the defendants were trying to help them complete ballots, not fix them. A jury swiftly acquitted them . Among other concerns, Senator Howell Heflin, an Alabama Democrat who sat on the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, doubted that the case merited the full force of the federal government, Steve Raby, Mr. Heflin\u2019s former chief of staff, said in an interview. Losing the support of a home-state senator proved fatal. It was only the second time in 48 years that a judicial nomination died in committee. Mr. Sessions, who prides himself on methodical preparation, has said he was \u201ca babe in the woods\u201d before the committee. If so, he has learned his lesson: In recent weeks, a string of African-Americans, whom he has recruited, hired and promoted, have come forward to testify to his lack of racial animus. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sessions is also mounting a vigorous effort to show that he stood up for civil rights as a federal prosecutor. He cites his successful pursuit of two Ku Klux Klan members who in 1981 brutally murdered a black teenager. \u201cThere were a lot of Southern United States attorneys who were not very welcoming to attorneys from the Civil Rights Division in the 1980s,\u201d said Barry Kowalski, the Justice Department attorney on the case and a lifelong Democrat. \u201cAnd he was.\u201d Mr. Sessions has also revised a list of the 10 most important cases that he \u201cpersonally handled\u201d as a prosecutor to include four voting rights and school desegregation cases, even though his involvement was minimal, former Justice Department lawyers said. Mr. Sessions has stood behind the Perry County prosecution. And he still considers voter fraud a problem, though studies have consistently shown that it is extraordinarily rare. Albert Turner died in 2000. His son and namesake, who is a Perry County commissioner, now defends Mr. Sessions. \u201cHe is not a racist,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI believe him when he says he was simply doing his job.\u201d His mother, Evelyn Turner, 80, does not. In February, at the congressional ceremony that honored her husband and other Selma marchers, the senator tried to hug her, she said. \u201cBut I said, \u2018No, get off of me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI know he has not changed.\u201d Crime and Punishment After he was elected senator, taking a seat on the same Judiciary Committee that denied him the judgeship, Mr. Sessions seemed to bear no grudge against those who had humiliated him in 1986. He collaborated with Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts on a bill to reduce prison rape . He also worked with Democrats to correct sentencing disparities that resulted in harsher penalties for those convicted of crimes involving crack cocaine , who were predominately black, than those convicted of powder cocaine, who were more likely to be white. But in general, he was viewed in the Senate as a bill killer, not a bill sponsor. Photo Mr. Sessions at the Capitol in June 2013. A frequent topic he would raise on the Senate floor was what he saw as the Obama administration\u2019s leniency toward drug offenders. Credit Drew Angerer for The New York Times \u201cPreventing something bad from happening is just as important to him as getting something good done,\u201d said Marcus Peacock, a former senior aide. C-Span played endlessly in his office and, if something disagreeable caught his ear, he summoned staff members to help him craft an immediate response in pencil on a yellow legal pad. \u201cEven if you had meetings, the assumption is you\u2019d be there,\u201d Mr. Peacock said. Then the senator was off to the Senate floor, often to speak to an empty room. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A frequent topic was what he saw as the Obama administration\u2019s leniency toward drug offenders. Mr. Sessions served as a federal prosecutor in Mobile in the heyday of the nation\u2019s war on drugs, a time when Congress passed lengthy mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes and the prison population ballooned. He has proudly described himself as a lieutenant in the nation\u2019s drug war. Many politicians now regard that as a period of excessive punishments. The Obama administration \u2014 using clemency, discretion and more lenient sentencing laws \u2014 has undone many of that era\u2019s policies and helped reduce the federal prison population for the first time in decades. But Mr. Sessions believes those long prison sentences produced low crime rates. \u201cIt\u2019s mathematics,\u201d he has said: the more criminals in prison, the fewer on the street. When Mr. Obama likened marijuana to alcohol, Mr. Sessions was \u201cheartbroken.\u201d \u201cThis drug is dangerous,\u201d he said last year, adding, \u201cGood people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u201d Liberals may chafe at such rigidity, but Mr. Sessions shares their disdain for the philosophy of \u201ctoo big to jail\u201d \u2014 the notion that prosecutors should consider whether bringing charges against large companies would imperil the economy. \u201cThis is a dangerous philosophy,\u201d he said in 2010 amid Justice Department investigations into the banks at the heart of the financial meltdown. \u201cNormally, I was taught, if they violated the law, you charge them. If they did not violate the law, you do not charge them.\u201d A Defining Issue But no single topic energizes Mr. Sessions more than immigration. In 2013, when the Senate was considering a pathway to citizenship for immigrants, Mr. Sessions spent more time on the Senate floor than its top leaders, aides said. The issue has defined his Senate career and, along with trade, formed his link to Mr. Trump. Soon after his arrival in Washington, Mr. Sessions had received a visit from Roy Beck, an author who had recently formed the group NumbersUSA to advocate reduced immigration. Mr. Beck arrived at Mr. Sessions\u2019s fourth-floor Senate office building prepared to make a sales pitch. Immigrants, here legally or illegally, he said, were taking jobs from American workers. Democrats, because of their Hispanic constituencies, were reluctant to address this, he said. And Republicans were too aligned with big corporations that benefited from immigrant labor. Mr. Beck figured that, as a former prosecutor, Mr. Sessions might be sympathetic at least to the idea that America\u2019s immigration laws should be better enforced. Photo Mr. Sessions in December 2014, appearing with law enforcement officials from around the country to criticize President Obama\u2019s immigration policies. The issue of immigration has defined his Senate career. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Almost immediately, Mr. Sessions began finishing Mr. Beck\u2019s sentences. He noted with dismay the transformation of Alabama\u2019s poultry industry, which for years had provided jobs \u2014 grueling, punishing work, but jobs nonetheless \u2014 to even the poorest, least-educated workers. \u201cHe saw a work force that was maybe half white, half black become mostly foreign,\u201d Mr. Beck recalled. Advertisement \u201cThis is what justice is about,\u201d Mr. Sessions told him. \u201cYou don\u2019t put your finger on the scale against the poor person who\u2019s trying to make a living.\u201d Since then, Mr. Sessions has become the most reliable congressional ally of anti-immigration groups. He supported a state law in Alabama that, among other things, required public schools to verify the immigration status of students and their parents and made it a crime for immigrants to not carry their legal papers. The goal was to make every aspect of life for illegal immigrants so unbearable that they would deport themselves. Federal courts ultimately gutted the law. Mr. Sessions\u2019s views have made him a target of critics who say he works too closely with people who have racist, xenophobic views. Several of the groups he has worked alongside were founded or nurtured by the activist John Tanton, who has described the anti-immigration fight in racial terms. \u201cFor European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority,\u201d Mr. Tanton once warned a friend . In 2015, Mr. Sessions received the annual Keeper of the Flame award from the Center for Security Policy, a Washington think tank that promotes anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. Its founder, Frank Gaffney, has argued, among other things, that Mr. Obama is secretly a Muslim and that the crescent in the new logo of the Missile Defense Agency is a veiled sign that the United States has submitted to Islamic law. Mr. Sessions has for years heard claims that his views are rooted in a fear of foreigners. He has steadfastly denied it. \u201cIt is not xenophobic but our patriotic duty to defend the integrity of our borders and the rule of law,\u201d he said in 2014. When business leaders said more foreign workers would help the economy, Mr. Sessions mocked them for playing \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d from behind the high fences of their estates. His office was a font of research that he sometimes personally thrust into the hands of fellow senators. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a traditional base of Republican support, strongly supported immigration legislation and went so far as to say that Republicans should not bother running a presidential candidate in 2016 if they did not pass it. \u201cGosh,\u201d Mr. Beck said to Mr. Sessions. \u201cHow far can you go on this?\u201d \u201cHow many votes does the Chamber of Commerce have?\u201d Mr. Sessions quipped. When it became clear that, over his vehement objections, the Senate would pass an immigration bill in 2013, Mr. Sessions helped rally conservative House members to defeat the bill and make sure it would not become law. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As attorney general, Mr. Sessions would oversee the hiring of immigration judges and the operation of immigration courts. Though the Department of Homeland Security directly enforces immigration laws, the Justice Department is involved in helping set immigration legal policy and in prosecuting people who return to the country after being deported. \u201cThroughout the debate on comprehensive immigration reform, no one was more anti-immigrant than Jeff Sessions,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cAnd for me that outweighs the fact that he is a colleague and someone that I have worked with well on other issues like trade.\u201d The Trump Campaign For years, Mr. Sessions envisioned a day when the Republican Party would shed its big-business, country-club image and become a workers\u2019 party. But his arguments gained little traction. In 2012, he believed, Mitt Romney handed Mr. Obama a second term by failing to appeal to voters earning less than $50,000. By 2015, Mr. Sessions was disillusioned and saw his party in disarray. In a 23-page memo to his colleagues that January, Mr. Sessions said the road to capturing working-class voters was clear: The party, he wrote, had to show how lax immigration policies had stolen their jobs and erased their prospects for moving up the social ladder. \u201cRepublicans cannot win in 2016 without these voters,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand Republicans cannot win these voters unless they prove that they are willing to break from the donor class.\u201d When Mr. Trump announced his presidential bid six months later, Mr. Sessions saw a potential political mold-breaker. Within weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign announcement, the two men talked by telephone about trade and immigration. In a 90-minute meeting in the senator\u2019s office in September 2015, Mr. Trump assured Mr. Sessions that he was in the race to win. The senator\u2019s staff shared position papers and a top aide, Stephen Miller, joined the campaign. When Mr. Sessions sent Republican candidates his questionnaire, every candidate except Mr. Trump ignored it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy\u201d to gain Mr. Sessions\u2019s support, Mr. Trump said after winning his endorsement late last February, just before sweeping a string of Southern primaries. \u201cI put in a lot of work on the subject matter.\u201d Advertisement Nor was it easy for the senator. Longtime Republican allies called to express their fury. Others refused to take calls from his staff. An article in the conservative National Review branded him \u201c a prostitute .\u201d Photo The Republican National Convention in July of last year. Mr. Sessions had the idea of inviting people whose relatives were murdered by illegal immigrants, according to Rudolph W. Giuliani, who credits the senator with shaping Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration views. Credit Alex Wong/Getty Images But Mr. Sessions did not waver, even at the lowest points of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. When Mr. Trump was denounced for his anti-immigration rhetoric, colleagues said, Mr. Sessions offered reassurance. He helped craft a crucial immigration speech and prepare for the presidential debates. It was the senator\u2019s idea to bring to the Republican convention people whose family members had been murdered by illegal immigrants, according to Rudolph W. Giuliani, a campaign adviser who credits Mr. Sessions with shaping Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration views. A Crucial Test For all that is known about Mr. Sessions, one thing that is unclear is how he will measure up to what he has declared to be a crucial test of an attorney general\u2019s qualifications: the willingness to stand up to the president, who in this case plucked him from obscurity. Critics point to his support for President George W. Bush\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program and Justice Department memos authorizing waterboarding as signs that Mr. Sessions takes a broad view of presidential power. But his supporters point to a track record of insisting on Justice Department oversight and independence. Mr. Sessions chastised the Obama administration for refusing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, saying that senior Justice Department lawyers should have told the president that they insisted on doing so, as a matter of principle. Mr. Sessions also did not support Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch\u2019s nomination because she stood behind Mr. Obama\u2019s authority to enact immigration policy through executive orders, which he called an abuse of presidential authority. The Justice Department can help the president achieve policy goals, he said, but must stand firm against overreaching. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be prepared to say no,\u201d he said in 2011. \u201cAnd if you do, politicians normally come around. You don\u2019t have to do it publicly. You just tell him, \u2018Mr. President, you cannot do that.\u2019\u201d Now, as Mr. Trump embarks on a presidency in which he promises to remake Washington and dispense with many of its traditions, it will fall to Mr. Sessions to decide if and when to say no. And his reputation for standing up to the powers that be, consequences be damned, may face its stiffest test yet. Emily Bazelon, Campbell Robertson and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.

Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images Israeli security forces and emergency personnel gather at the site of a vehicle-ramming attack in Jerusalem on Sunday. Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images At least four people were killed and 15 more injured after a truck plowed into pedestrians in Jerusalem, say Israeli police. According to police spokeswoman Luba Samri, the driver swerved into a group of Israeli soldiers who had just gotten off a bus at the Armon Hanatziv promenade. The driver \"has been neutralized,\" Israeli police say. They are describing the killing as a terrorist act by a man who hails from Jabel Mukaber, a predominantly Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Israeli police have placed a gag order on further details pending an investigation. \"You don't need more than two to three seconds to find a terrorist target. The soldiers at the scene reacted immediately and killed the attacker,\" Israeli Police Chief Roni Alsheich said, according to the news service Haaretz. In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned the attack, connecting the suspect to ISIS. \"We know the identity of the attacker, according to all the signs he is a supporter of Islamic State,\" Netanyahu said, according to Reuters. \"We have sealed off Jabel Mukabar, the neighbourhood from where he came, and we are carrying out other actions which I will not detail.\" Article continues after sponsorship Israeli emergency services say that the four people \u2014 three women and one man \u2014 killed in the attack were in their 20s. At least 15 people have been hospitalized. The Guardian offers more details from the scene of the attack: \"The attack took place during a visit by a large group of Israeli soldiers to a scenic outlook overlooking Jerusalem and the Old City. \"The scene of the attack is also a few blocks from the American consulate in the city which speculation has suggested could be controversially re-designated as a future US embassy by Donald Trump's administration if he moves the embassy to Jerusalem although there was no immediate indication what motivated the driver. ... \"The driver was shot dead by other soldiers and one of the tour guides with the group that was hit as the driver reversed back towards the dead and injured.\" As reporter Daniel Estrin tells NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro, this is the first major attack on Israelis since early November. But for more than a year before that, there had been a spate of stabbings and shooting attacks against Israelis by Palestinians. Sunday's truck attack comes amid renewed scrutiny on Israeli settlements in land the country captured during the 1967 Six-Day War. Late last month, the United Nations Security Council voted 14 to 0 to condemn those settlements, as the U.S. abstained and allowed the resolution to pass. Last week, in a rare move, an Israeli military court convicted one of its soldiers of manslaughter for killing a Palestinian assailant. The case had become deeply divisive in the country. ",

(Photo: Jeff Hanisch, USA TODAY Sports) GREEN BAY, Wis. _ So long as the Green Bay Packers have Aaron Rodgers, they're never out of a game. Rodgers threw one of his trademark Hail Mary passes, connecting with Randall Cobb for a 42-yard score to complete a 14-point swing in the last four minutes of the first half in Sunday's wild-card game against the New York Giants. The Aaron Rodgers Hail Mary TD Trilogy. #GoPackGo pic.twitter.com/SYfIM3vuim \u2014 NFL (@NFL) January 8, 2017 With time for just one play, Rodgers hung on the ball just long enough to give his receivers time to get to the end zone. Cobb took up position in the end zone behind\u00a0Landon Collins, Eli Apple, Tevin Wade and Keenan Robinson all in front of him. Giving Collins a little shove, Cobb gave himself just enough space to leap and grab the ball, setting off pandemonium at Lambeau Field. After booing the Packers earlier in the half, fans serenaded them with cheers and chants of \"Go Pack Go!\" as players ran off the field and into the locker room with a 14-6 lead. Are u fresking kidding me?? Looks like they are trying to get an cheap interceptions instead of knocking the damn ball down. SMH!! \u2014 Antrel Rolle (@antrelrolle26) January 8, 2017 The score is just the latest in Rodgers' list of last-ditch heroics. He saved Green Bay's season last year with one in Detroit, and threw another in last year's divisional playoff game at Arizona. The play was in almost the same spot as Eli Manning's Hail Mary to Hakeem Nicks in a 2011 playoff game against the Packers. The Hail Mary came one possession after the Packers had taken the lead on Rodgers' thread-the-needle pass to Davante Adams. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

JAN. 8, 2017 8:02 PM ET Photo Emma Stone is nominated for her performance in \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Credit Jordan Strauss/Invision, via Associated Press Dave Itzkoff Reporter 7:33 PM ET Good evening, everyone! The 2017 awards season begins tonight with the 74th Golden Globes, and we\u2019re here to keep you company, to comment and to commiserate throughout the whole three-hour show. I\u2019m Dave Itzkoff, a culture reporter for The New York Times. I\u2019m joined by Wesley Morris, critic-at-large, and Melena Ryzik, a fellow reporter and awards-season veteran. Melena Ryzik Reporter 7:33 PM ET Thanks Dave and hello all! Happy to be part of this viewing party. Jimmy Fallon is hosting, which means it will likely veer towards silly escapism, instead of the social wit of the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler years or the barbs of the cringy Ricky Gervais era. Expect an opening song-and-dance number in the vein of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Damien Chazelle\u2019s musical love letter to Los Angeles. But Fallon also knows his Hollywood audience, so he\u2019ll doubtless riff on the president-elect \u2013 perhaps to atone further for his softball \u201cTonight Show\u201d interview with his fellow NBC personality during the campaign. (He already did some penance, opposite Tina on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d) And given the unusually diverse spate of TV nominees \u2013 including newcomers like Issa Rae of \u201cInsecure\u201d and Riz Ahmed of \u201cThe Night Of\u201d \u2013 expect some potentially political moments, stirring or grandstanding too. Melena Ryzik Here\u2019s a link to that SNL clip. http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update-denise-mcdonough-and-doreen-troilo/3112631 Wesley Morris Critic 7:34 PM ET Hello Dave and Melena and everybody else. This is going to be fun \u2013 even when some of what we\u2019re watching threatens to be the opposite of that. The Golden Globes have always been the chillest of these big awards extravaganzas. They\u2019re first up, for one thing. The stakes are lower (or they used to be), the vibe boozier, the winners occasionally more baffling. The top movies, expectations-wise, are \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cMoonlight.\u201d But, you know, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN (especially in the TV categories). But maybe it won\u2019t. Which actually, might be a weird comfort since anything is happening everywhere else. Let\u2019s do it! Dave Itzkoff Reporter 7:38 PM ET O.K., Wesley and Melena, I\u2019m going to make you stake out a prediction in advance. \u201cLa La Land\u201d seems a safe bet in the best musical/comedy film category. (Unless \u201cDeadpool\u201d surprises us all.) The real showdown, one assumes, will be between \u201cManchester By the Sea\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d in the best dramatic film category. Who goes home with the trophy? Melena Ryzik Reporter 7:42 PM ET My money\u2019s on \u201cManchester.\u201d With \u201cMoonlight\u201d picking up some acting awards, and maybe a screenplay trophy \u2013 although that\u2019s another category where they\u2019re neck-and-neck. Wesley Morris Critic 7:44 PM ET Yeah it is. I\u2019d say the folks at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (they give these things out) will go with \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d Wesley Morris But I\u2019m standing with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d since it stayed with me. Melena Ryzik Reporter 7:52 PM ET Amazon has put major muscle into its campaigning for \u201cManchester.\u201d But you also can\u2019t count out a dark horse action candidate, like \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d from a studio or from players who know how to finesse the game \u2013 in this case, an on-the-rebound Mel Gibson, the director of \u201cHacksaw.\u201d Remember that last year the Hollywood Foreign Press Association drama pick was \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d after a never-ending campaign by Leonardo DiCaprio. Tamara Best 8:08 PM ET Photo Casey Affleck is nominated for his performance in \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d Credit Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Dave Itzkoff Reporter 7:53 PM ET Give me your quick pick for Best TV drama: the grizzled veteran \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d or one of the newcomers: \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cThis Is Us\u201d or \u201cWestworld\u201d? Wesley Morris \u201cStranger Things\u201d \u2013 because something\u2019s gotta be in the Upside Down tonight. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 7:56 PM ET I\u2019ll take a chance and make a prediction of my own: 1980s me says \u201cStranger Things,\u201d 2017 me says \u201cThis is Us.\u201d Wesley Morris Critic 7:59 PM ET \u201cThis Is Us\u201d? It\u2019s like \u201cParenthood\u201d and \u201cCrash\u201d had a baby in the frozen aisle at Whole Foods. Dave Itzkoff It keeps me warm at nights. Dave Itzkoff Here we go: Show time. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:01 PM ET As was foretold, we\u2019re starting with a pretaped opening - unusual for the Golden Globes - that\u2019s a musical riff on \u201cLa La Land,\u201d with Jimmy Fallon singing his way through red carpet traffic. Tamara Best Jimmy Fallon in an opening sequence. Credit Getty Images Wesley Morris And it\u2019s all being politely sung in the key of Emma Stone. Dave Itzkoff The \u201cStranger Things\u201d kids rapping and singing was all that mattered to me. Wesley Morris Yeah \u2013 the \u201cStranger Things\u201d kids rapping will be worth my annoyance two hours from now. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:04 PM ET \u201cRoomful of stars, they\u2019ve been getting drunk since 3,\u201d Fallon sings. Truth is, the Globes are not the drunkfest they\u2019re made out to be. Dave Itzkoff If, say, one did not actually see \u201cLa La Land,\u201d does this still make sense? Melena Ryzik In West Hollywood. At the Abbey. Dave Itzkoff Also, did you know Jimmy Fallon was friends with Justin Timberlake? Melena Ryzik News to me and everyone else with an Internet connection. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:06 PM ET \u201cAlready the TelePrompTer is down, so this is a great way to start the show.\u201d Jimmy Fallon seems serious about this. Wesley Morris If this goes poorly for Jimmy, there will alway be that: Justin. Dave Itzkoff He\u2019s being amiable about it. Wesley Morris Reporter 8:07 PM ET \u201cThis is one of the few places left, where America still honors the popular vote\u201d \u2013 Fallon takes on Trump right away. Wesley Morris That might be the only election joke he makes. Dave Itzkoff How do we feel about Jimmy Fallon opening with a Chris Rock impression? Melena Ryzik I wonder how Chris Rock feels about it? Wesley Morris He likes it because it was funny. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:09 PM ET Fallon on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d: \u201cA lot of people have wondered what it would\u2019ve been like if King Joffrey had lived. Well, in 12 days we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d Wesley Morris Reporter 8:10 PM ET Here\u2019s one more \u2013 Fallon on \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d: \u201cThe character has been dubbed the world\u2019s worst opera singer. And even she turned down Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u201d Dave Itzkoff We did get the Trump jokes we were promised. Mekado Murphy 8:11 PM ET The winner for best supporting actor in a motion picture is Aaron Taylor-Johnson for \u201cNocturnal Animals.\u201d Mekado Murphy Aaron Taylor-Johnson, right, with Michael Shannon in \u201cNocturnal Animals.\u201d Credit Merrick Morton/Focus Features Melena Ryzik That\u2019s a surprise to me right out the gate. Melena Ryzik Mahershala Ali (\u201cMoonlight\u201d) was the favorite. Wesley Morris Critic 8:13 PM ET Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays a nasty hick in the scuzzy perfume ad also knows as \u201cNocturnal Animals.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Of him, yes. Of the movie, I don\u2019t know her. Mekado Murphy 8:13 PM ET The winner for best actor in a TV series drama is Billy Bob Thornton for \u201cGoliath.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Another shock to me, I\u2019ll say that. Wesley Morris It is! Are you guys watching \u201cGoliath\u201d? It\u2019s really good. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:15 PM ET Billy Bob says he\u2019s especially surprised he beat Bob Odenkirk, with whom he\u2019s \u201chad a feud since the 1940s when we did a movie with Van Johnson.\u201d Wesley Morris Apparently, the Electoral College is also voting for these awards. Wesley Morris Reporter 8:16 PM ET I like a beef in an awards show thank-you speech. Also, kudos to Billy Bob for sticking to the dark-glasses-indoors look. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:18 PM ET Two awards and two big shocks for me. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association just works differently, I guess. Wesley Morris Reporter 8:19 PM ET Well, how the H.F.P.A. works is anyone\u2019s guess \u2013 although they\u2019ve tried to clean up their act recently. Being schmoozed less openly by the studios and stars, for instance. Wesley Morris Critic 8:19 PM ET I told you guys: The Upside Down, man. But \u201cGoliath,\u201d which I like, is an Amazon show. Wesley Morris Keep your eye on that. Wesley Morris An Amazon sweep or something like that. Melena Ryzik Bezos being in the audience! Wesley Morris Oh snap. The Beez is in the house. Dave Itzkoff Who is fulfilling my Amazon orders right now? Wesley Morris The gang at Seeso, Dave. Dave Itzkoff All right Golden Globes, continue to surprise me. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:21 PM ET Fallon: \u201cI just got off the phone with Mariah Carey and she thinks Dick Clark Productions sabotaged my monologue.\u201d Wesley Morris Mariah: Still winning. Even when she\u2019s lost. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:22 PM ET In a weird way I think it\u2019s lucky Fallon had the TelePrompTer problems. They covered up for a fairly lackluster monologue. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:25 PM ET Guys, BTW: whatever you think about \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins,\u201d can\u2019t wait for Meryl\u2019s turn on stage (she\u2019s getting an honorary award). Because she\u2019s entered the don\u2019t-give-a-hoot stage of her career (a.k.a. the Mariah stage). Mekado Murphy 8:23 PM ET The winner for best actress in a TV series, musical or comedy, is Tracee Ellis Ross for \u201cblack-ish.\u201d Tamara Best Tracee Ellis Ross Credit Jordan Strauss/Invision Wesley Morris Agreed. He\u2019ll be fine from here on out. Dave Itzkoff That was a crazy competitive category. Can everyone win? Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:25 PM ET It was exactly as mild as any Fallon monologue. The TelePrompTer problem was the most memorable part of it. Wesley Morris Critic 8:25 PM ET I know. But I can go home now, the second-funniest woman on TV FINALLY wins something (sorry, Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Wesley Morris But not sorry. She\u2019s won everything. Wesley Morris Reporter 8:26 PM ET Tracee Ellis Ross: \u201cThis is for all the women, women of color, and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy and valid and important. But I want you to know that I see you, we see you.\u201d Melena Ryzik She also breaks a cardinal rule of Hollywood by revealing her actual age \u2013 44. Mekado Murphy The winner for best TV series, musical or comedy, is \u201cAtlanta\u201d on FX. Mekado Murphy Intense but reserved: Donald Glover in \u201cAtlanta.\u201d Credit Guy D'Alema/FX Dave Itzkoff Another stunner, but one I\u2019m very happy to see. Melena Ryzik This is the first of many awards for \u201cAtlanta.\u201d Wesley Morris Critic 8:28 PM ET OK, now we\u2019re black on Earth. I mean, \u201cback.\u201d Of course, yes. I meant \u201cback.\u201c Dave Itzkoff This show is in its first season, beating veterans like \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:28 PM ET Donald Glover: \u201cI really want to thank Atlanta, and all the black folks in Atlanta, for real. Just for being alive and being amazing people.\u201d Wesley Morris Critic 8:36 PM ET Vince Vaughn just introduced the clip from drama nominee \u201cHacksaw Ridge.\u201d And I got another surprise-winner chill. Mekado Murphy 8:36 PM ET The winner for best actress in a limited series or TV movie is Sarah Paulson for \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.\u201d Dave Itzkoff OK, this one was anticipated. Still satisfying! Dave Itzkoff Did she bring Marcia Clark tonight? Melena Ryzik If so, I hope Kerry Washington (\u201cConfirmation\u201d) brought Anita Hill. Wesley Morris Critic 8:38 PM ET The more I think about it, the more fantastic Sarah P. was on \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson.\u201d Wesley Morris She was the best in that class of people. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:39 PM ET Paulson on Marcia Clark: \u201cIf I could live my life with a fraction of your wit, integrity and your unapologetic fierceness, I would be on the road to doing it right.\u201d Mekado Murphy 8:39 PM ET The winner for best limited series or TV movie is \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d on FX. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:40 PM ET Since this was also expected, I\u2019ll just say that I love seeing people in the second tier of seating taking camera-phone pictures of the people in the first tier of seating. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:41 PM ET Or skulking behind them in the about-to-cut-to-commercial moments. I recognized a few H.F.P.A. members back there. Wesley Morris I love the flair on that producer\u2019s jacket. Wesley Morris Oh yes. Melena, spill the beans. Give us H.F.P.A. gossip? Who snores during screenings? Melena Ryzik None of them. They are all busy cozying up for photos. Melena Ryzik (Award-season screenings often involve meet-and-greets with the stars.) Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:44 PM ET I think I just heard two-time Golden Globe nominee Jason Lee doing the voiceover in an IHOP commercial for all-you-can-eat pancakes. Just to keep things in perspective. Melena Ryzik Dave, good on you for not muting the commercials. Tell me how you do it. Dave Itzkoff You know, it\u2019s all content. Wesley Morris Critic 8:45 PM ET Well, who\u2019s, like, the cozying-uppest? Nevermind. Let just marvel at this latest attempt, courtesy of AT&T, to over-dramatize what it\u2019s like to watch, say, \u201cKnight Rider\u201d on a phone. Wesley Morris Critic 8:47 PM ET So we just got back from commercial and Julia Louis-Dreyfus was on Questlove\u2019s turntable, playing Bruno Mars. That\u2019ll be a nice gag if they keep it up. Melena Ryzik I would 100% go to a party DJ\u2019d by JLD. Dave Itzkoff Mekado Murphy 8:48 PM ET The winner for best supporting actor in a series, limited series or TV movie is Hugh Laurie for \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:49 PM ET Thought Sterling K. Brown (\u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d), who won the Emmy, had this one in the bag too. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:49 PM ET A break in what will likely be a sweep for \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson,\u201d right? Wesley Morris Critic 8:49 PM ET Wow, indeed \u2013 Hugh Laurie. This is another shock even though, you know, it\u2019s Hugh Laurie, who will now give a Hall of Fame speech. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:50 PM ET \u201cThis is obviously a terrible mix-up,\u201d Hugh Laurie says humbly. He adds: \u201cI\u2019ll be able to say I won this at the last-ever Golden Globes. \u2026 It has the words Hollywood, Foreign and Press in the title. I also think that to some Republicans, even the word Association is slightly sketchy.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Before anyone jumps in, I don\u2019t believe those Sofia Vergara lines were accidental. Wesley Morris \u201cAnal tradition\u201d? I think not. Dave Itzkoff They\u2019ll make great moments on social media, though. Wesley Morris But all award shows are! Mekado Murphy The winner for best original motion picture score is Justin Hurwitz for \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:53 PM ET Any musical win for \u201cLa La Land\u201d is a gimme. Can we talk about the most GIF-able moments so far? The biggest may have come on the red carpet, between Jenna Bush Hager and Pharrell. Dave Itzkoff When she said he was a nominee for \u201cHidden Fences\u201d? Wesley Morris \u201cHidden Fences\u201d had Tracy Jordan\u2019s best acting yet. Dave Itzkoff Works as a GIF, really needs the audio to sell it. Just my 2 cents. Melena Ryzik Reporter 8:54 PM ET Dave, there you go being all technical about what makes a Gif. Do you also pronounce it Jif? Mekado Murphy 8:54 PM ET The winner for best original motion picture song is \u201cCity of Stars\u201d from \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Reporter 8:57 PM ET Those are composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. They had this one in the bag, I thought. Still, that\u2019s one award that didn\u2019t go to Lin-Manuel Miranda! Wesley Morris Critic 8:58 PM ET Well, fortunately, it\u2019s the EGOT not the EGGGOT. So hopefully he\u2019ll be OK. (That\u2019s Emmy Grammy Oscar Tony for newbies.) Wesley Morris Critic 8:59 PM ET But yeah, he could lose the Oscar, now, too. But LMM will win all the Oscars for \u201cHamilton the Movie.\u201d Wesley Morris Questlove is killing it. He just went to commercial on a lick of Billy Squire. Wesley Morris John Legend still looks like he\u2019s about to hand 11th-grade me a corsage. Mekado Murphy The winner for best supporting actress in a motion picture is Viola Davis for \u201cFences.\u201d Mekado Murphy Viola Davis with Denzel Washington in \u201cFences.\u201d Credit David Lee/Paramount Pictures Melena Ryzik Viola Davis was the favorite in this category. Dave Itzkoff Actual \u201cFences,\u201d not \u201cHidden Fences.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Reporter 9:03 PM ET I\u2019d wondered if Michelle Williams might sneak off with this one for \u201cManchester By the Sea.\u201d Melena Ryzik Reporter 9:03 PM ET She and Tracee Ellis Ross are going to have some of the strongest speeches of the night. Wesley Morris Viola\u2019s the best supporting actress who didn\u2019t support anybody. SHE\u2019S A LEAD. Wesley Morris Critic 9:04 PM ET But she won and she\u2019s giving a killer speech. So I\u2019ll just let my welled-up eyes speak for me. Melena Ryzik Reporter 9:05 PM ET Ah but that\u2019s the game \u2013 very judicious decision by the powers-that-be to put her in the supporting actress category for the film. She won best actress at the Tony Awards for the same role. Dave Itzkoff Reporter 9:05 PM ET Viola Davis: \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that Hollywood thinks of translating a play to screen. It doesn\u2019t scream money-maker, you know. But it does scream art. It does scream heart.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Reporter 9:05 PM ET \u201cTo the original Troy, my father, Dan Davis. Born in 1936, groomed horses, had a 5th grade education. Didn\u2019t know how to read until he was 15. But you know what, he had a story and it deserved to be told and August Wilson told it.\u201d Wesley Morris Critic 9:09 PM ET You\u2019re right, Melena. But as you know, I hate that kind of positioning. It\u2019s not the most competitive year for lead actress, and the one who gave the best performance (Isabelle Huppert in \u201cElle\u201d) will never win. Viola Davis could have won. But whatever. She\u2019s winning anyway. Mekado Murphy 9:10 PM ET The winner for best supporting actress in a series, limited series or TV movie is Olivia Colman for \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d Dave Itzkoff Reporter 9:11 PM ET Since Olivia Colman\u2019s not on hand to accept, I liked fellow nominees Chrissy Metz and Mandy Moore of \u201cThis Is Us\u201d holding hands. That\u2019s all. Wesley Morris ",

REUTERS/Wissm al-Okili Email BAGHDAD - A wave of attacks in and around Baghdad on Sunday killed at least 23 people, the latest in a series of assaults blamed on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS .) A suicide car bomb ripped through a wholesale market in the sprawling Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City, killing at least seven people and wounding 15, said Brig. Gen. Saad Maan, the Interior Ministry spokesman. He said a member of the security forces spotted the bomber and opened fire but was unable to prevent the attack. A policeman and two medical officials gave a higher toll, saying 16 people were killed in the attack and another 47 wounded. At a hospital where victims of the attack had been taken, a body exploded inside a morgue refrigerator. The medics said it appeared to have been a second attacker who was killed by shrapnel from the first explosion. After more than two years of ISIS occupation, Iraq's second-largest city is being taken back by the Iraqi Army. Lara Logan reports from Mosul. ISIS claimed the attack, saying it was targeting Shiites. The Sunni extremist group views Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority as apostates deserving of death. Elsewhere in the city, a suicide bomber killed nine shoppers and wounded 16 others at a fruit and vegetable market in a mainly Shiite neighborhood. Three additional bombings in and around the capital killed seven people and wounded 24 others. Police and medical officials confirmed the casualty figures. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information. ISIS has carried out a string of bombings in Baghdad over the past week, killing dozens of people. A suicide bomber struck Sadr City last week, killing more than 40 people. The latest attacks come as Iraqi forces are trying to drive ISIS militants from the northern city of Mosul in a massive operation launched in mid-October. In recent days, troops have pushed closer to the Tigris River, which splits the city in half. Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, fell to ISIS in the summer of 2014, when the militants swept over much of northern and western Iraq. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Kovacs and his family were going through security when gunfire erupted yesterday. They had returned from a Caribbean cruise and were on their way home to Vancouver, Canada. In the mayhem after the shooting they lost their shoes, passports and ID's. (AP Photo/Kelli Kennedy) 0 Shares Email Dan and Janice Kovacs and their two children were passing through airport security when the gunfire erupted. They were shoeless \u2014 with wallets, passports and carry-on items chugging along a conveyer belt \u2014 when they sprang into the mass of people running to safety. Now they're among stranded travelers at Fort Lauderdale trying to recover what the airport director says are 25,000 pieces of luggage, cellphones and other belongings separated from their owners during Friday's shooting rampage. \"We have no IDs, we have no passports, no money,\" Janice, 39, said Saturday afternoon, wearing sandals borrowed from a brother-in-law. \"We just had to leave our stuff and run.\" \"All our stuff is being processed. We might not even get that until Monday. I have an 11-year-old who is freaking out. This has been traumatic for her,\" she said. The shooting Friday afternoon, which killed five people and wounded six, also stranded about 12,000 outgoing and incoming travelers, many returning from cruises or arriving ahead of the usual Saturday departures of the massive ships based in the tourism hub's Port Everglades terminal. Some travelers were kept on planes for more than seven hours while police put the airport on lockdown; others scrambled to protected corners or were hustled out onto the tarmac. The Kovacs, on the way home to Vancouver, British Columbia, after a Caribbean cruise, went out onto that rough surface barefoot. The Florida Highway Patrol sent computer-equipped buses to the airport Saturday afternoon to issue temporary ID cards to help travelers get out of state and even abroad. \"We are doing what we can to help,\" Sgt. Mark Wysocki said. Sydney Rivera, a 21-year-old Purdue University student, received a temporary Florida identification card that is nearly identical to the state's driver's license. On Friday, she had been about to board a flight home to Indianapolis in another terminal when people scattered over false fears of a second shooter. \"This will make it a lot easier to get through security,\" Rivera said as she rushed to finally catch a flight. Gov. Rick Scott said cruise ship companies were asked to accept travelers with provisional IDs. Once authorities began allowing travelers to depart the airport Friday evening, buses took thousands of them to the cruise terminal. Airport spokesman Greg Meyer said most bags won't be available until Monday. The airport hired an outside firm to collect discarded bags and sort them by where they were found so they can be identified by their owners. Those with lost luggage were told to call a toll-free number. But there were exceptions as airport officials scrambled to work with individuals. Jessie Khalastchi, a 21-year-old college student from London, left her carry-on bag and laptop that contained a paper for school when she fled the gunfire. She was reunited with her belongings Saturday afternoon, just in time to catch a flight out of Miami. The Kovacs also received some of their luggage late Saturday but were still waiting for their IDs, cellphones, passports and wallets. Richard Lanbry, his wife and 15-year-old daughter were about to board a plane home for Montreal when the shooting began. Amid the commotion, he was separated from the other two and frantically searched for them for about an hour. \"I was pushed down, my wife was pushed down too. It was violent ... people screaming, people crying, old and young. It was very scary,\" said the 61-year-old, who was vacationing in Pompano Beach. On top of that, they now have no luggage, no keys to their home and no coats or sweaters to wear once they arrive in chilly Montreal, only the T-shirts they we wearing the day before. Larry and Joy Edwards were about to board their flight home to Columbus, Ohio , after a Caribbean cruise. They ran out the skyway and down stairs onto the tarmac, where they were told to drop their carry-on bags and dash out to the runway. They eventually were taken to a hangar and bused to Port Everglades. That's where they spent most of the night. \"The Red Cross came. They gave us food and blankets and pillows. Everybody did what they could,\" Joy Edwards said. At 4:30 a.m., they were bused to a Miami motel. They had come back to the airport in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve their luggage, which contained their passports, medicine and other essentials. Larry Edwards, a retired electric lineman, said they won't be able to get home until Monday and pointed to the clothes they had put on Friday morning. \"All we have is this and our smelly selves,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

Damien Chazelle's bright-hued Los Angeles musical \"La La Land\" dominated the Beverly Hills, California, ceremony with seven awards \u2014 a Golden Globes' record \u2014 including best motion picture, comedy or musical, further cementing its Oscar favorite status. But perhaps its stiffest Academy Awards competition, Barry Jenkins' tender coming of age drama \"Moonlight\" \u2014 which competed largely in separate dramatic categories \u2014 took the night's final award, best motion picture, drama. It was its only hardware despite six nominations. MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR Yet the night belonged to Meryl Streep, this year's Cecil B. DeMille Award honoree, who most articulated an argument for the inclusivity of the movies \u2014 an ongoing theme of the night \u2014 over the platform of the president elect. Streep, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention, called the president-elect's mocking of a disabled reporter on the campaign trail the year's performance that most \"stunned her.\" Arguing for the international makeup of Hollywood, Streep listed off the far-flung homes of stars from Dev Patel to Ryan Gosling. \"Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners and if you kick them all out, you'll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts,\" Streep said to loud applause. \"La La Land\" came in with a leading seven nominations, and won everything it was nominated for, including best film, musical or comedy. Chazelle won both best director and best screenplay. Gosling won best actor in a comedy or musical, as did Emma Stone for best actress. It also took best score (Justin Hurwitz) and best song for \"City of Stars.\" \"I'm in in daze now, officially,\" said the fresh-faced, 31-year-old Chazelle accepting his award for directing. In one of the evening's more emotional acceptance speeches, Gosling dedicated his award to the late brother of his partner, Eva Mendes. \"While I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer,\" said Gosling, referring to Juan Carlos Mendes. The Beverly Hills, California, ceremony got off to a rocky start, with a broken teleprompter initially froze Fallon. \"Cut to Justin Timberlake, please,\" implored a desperately improvising Fallon. It was the second fiasco for Globes producer Dick Clark Productions, which presented the infamous Mariah Carey flub on New Year's Eve. Video: Jimmy Fallon's Golden Globes intro Watch the cold open for the 2017 Golden Globe Awards. Watch the cold open for the 2017 Golden Globe Awards. See more videos The \"Tonight Show\" host started the show with a cold open ode to \"La La Land\" in a lavish sketch more typical of the Academy Awards than the Globes. Fallon did a version of the film's opening dance scene, with starry cameos from Timberlake, previous Globes host Tina Fey, Amy Adams and the white Ford Bronco of \"The People v. O.J. Simpson.\" In a more truncated monologue, Fallon's sharpest barbs weren't directed at the stars in the room (as was the style of frequent host Ricky Gervais) but president-elect Trump. He compared Trump to the belligerent teenage king Joffrey of \"Games of Thrones.\" His first line (at least once the teleprompter was up) was introducing the Globes as \"one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote.\" Film and television industry-ites arrive on the red carpet at the 2017 Golden Globes at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. That, though, isn't quite true. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a collection of 85 members, has its own methods of selecting winners. Best supporting actress winner Viola Davis, the co-star of Denzel Washington's August Wilson adaptation \"Fences,\" alluded to the group's reputation for being wined and dined. \"I took all the pictures, went to luncheon,\" said Davis, to knowing chuckles through the ballroom, as she clutched her award. \"But it's right on time.\" Davis continued what appears to be a certain path to the Oscar. Another favorite, Casey Affleck, also padded his favorite status. The \"Manchester by the Sea\" star took best actor. Coming a year after a second-straight of OscarsSoWhite protests, the night was notable for the widespread diversity of its winners, in film and TV. Donald Glover's \"Atlanta\" won best comedy series over heavyweights like \"Veep\" and \"Transparent,\" and Glover later added best actor in a comedy. Glover looked visibly surprised. \"I really want to thank Atlanta and all the black folks in Atlanta,\" said Glover. \"I couldn't be here without Atlanta.\" Tracee Ellis Ross, accepting the award for best actress in a TV comedy for \"Black-ish,\" dedicated her award to \"all of the women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy and valid and important.\" \"I want you to know that I see you, we see you,\" said Ross. The British actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson took best supporting actor for his performance in Tom Ford's \"Nocturnal Animals.\" It was a surprise that Taylor-Johnson was even nominated, so his win over favorites Mahershala Ali from \"Moonlight\" and Jeff Bridges from \"Hell or High Water\" was a shock. \"The People v. O.J. Simpson\" taking best miniseries, as well as an award for Sarah Paulson. But other winners were less prepared. Hugh Laurie, star of \"The Night Manager,\" looked even more surprised when he won best supporting actor in a limited series or TV film over the likes of John Travolta (\"The People v. O.J. Simpson\") and John Lithgow (\"The Crown\"). Laurie was one of the few early winners to pepper his acceptance speech with comments about Trump. \"I accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere,\" he said. \"The Night Manager\" won two more awards, including best actor for Tom Hiddleston. Paul Verhoeven's \"Elle\" won best foreign language film and its star Isabelle Huppert was crowned best actress in a drama. Disney's \"Zootopia\" took best animated feature. Other winners included Tracee Ellis Ross (\"Black-ish\") and Billy Bob Thornton (\"Goliath\"). Associated Press\u00a0 ",

The deployment -- which also includes 3,500 U.S. Troops -- is to protect Eastern Europe against a potential Russian invasion. In the dock area of the German city of Bremerhaven all around is American military hardware just off the boat -- everything from Humvees to tanks.\u00a0 The official name for this display of military muscle is Operation Atlantic Resolve.\u00a0 Its purpose is to reassure America\u2019s nervous European allies that the U.S. military will stand with them against any aggressive moves by Russia. Moves, like the 2014 invasion of Crimea, when Russian troops arrived in what had been Ukraine -- and seized it for the Kremlin.\u00a0 Trump acknowledges Russia may have meddled in the U.S. election America\u2019s response is a decision to stop the draw down of U.S. troops in Europe, and reverse it -- in the first buildup since the end of the Cold War. \u201cWe intend to reassure all those here in Europe that we are committed to peace and security, and to send a signal to anybody else who would differ with that, that that\u2019s not gonna work,\u201d said Lt. General Timothy Ray, deputy commander of the U.S.\u2019s European command. That anybody else would be Vladimir Putin, who is on record as saying its stupid and unrealistic to think that Russia would attack anyone.\u00a0 But just in case, Operation Atlantic Resolve is big and very visible deterrent. Over the next week all the equipment will leave Germany and be sent to Poland, and from there, be deployed across Eastern Europe.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "UK's May Vows to Seek Ambitious EU Deal and Work With Trump By jill lawless, associated press LONDON \u0097 Jan 8, 2017, 2:26 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2016 file photo, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to attend the weekly Prime Ministers' Questions session, in parliament in London. Prime Minister Theresa May's office says Thursday Jan. 5, 2017, the British leader will meet Donald Trump in Washington in the weeks following his Jan. 20 inauguration as U.S. president. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, File) 0 Shares Email Prime Minister Theresa May said Sunday she will announce details of Britain's European Union exit plans in the next few weeks, and denied a former diplomat's claim that the government is \"muddled\" about Brexit . In her first interview of 2017, May also said Donald Trump had made \"unacceptable\" comments about women \u2014 but stressed she's had \"good\" conversations with the U.S. president-elect about the vital trans-Atlantic relationship. May has said for months that she will invoke Article 50 of the EU's key treaty, triggering two years of EU exit talks, by March 31. But she has refused to reveal details of Britain's goals or negotiating strategy. May argues that to do so would weaken Britain's hand, but the lack of detail has fueled allegations that government plans for Brexit are in disarray. Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain's EU envoy last week, criticized politicians' \"ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking\" about the EU exit. In an interview with Sky News, May insisted the government is \"not at all\" muddled. \"I will be setting out some more details in the coming weeks,\" she said. She signaled the U.K. is likely to leave the bloc's single market in goods and services, saying Britain won't try to keep \"bits of membership\" once it leaves. Many U.K. businesses \u2014 especially in London's huge financial-services sector \u2014 argue that access to the single market is vital. But EU leaders say membership is impossible unless Britain continues to allow the free movement of workers from other EU countries. May said free movement would end because Britain has voted to take control of its borders. But she also said she did not see immigration and trade as \"a binary issue\" or \"a zero-sum game.\" She said Britain would seek an \"ambitious trade deal ... that allows our companies to trade in and operate in the European single market.\" May, who took office in July, also faces the challenge in 2017 of forging a relationship with a new U.S. president. The prime minister, a long-time campaigner for women's equality, was asked about Trump's vulgar 2005 remark that his celebrity allowed him to grope women and \"grab them by the p----.\" \"I think that's unacceptable,\" she said. \"In fact, Donald Trump himself has said that and has apologized for it. \"But the relationship that the U.K. has with the United States is about something much bigger than just the relationship between the two individuals as president and prime minister,\" she added. May's top advisers have met Trump's transition team, and the Foreign Office said Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was in the U.S. on Sunday to meet \"close advisers to the president-elect and senior Congressional leaders.\" May said she has had two \"very good, positive\" phone calls with Trump since the Nov. 8 U.S. election. \"From the conversations I've had, I think we are going to look to build on that relationship, for the benefit of both the U.S. and the U.K.,\" she said. Trump tweeted Sunday that \"I look very much forward to meeting Prime Minister Theresa May in Washington in the Spring. Britain, a longtime U.S. ally, is very special!\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Rafsanjani, Iran Leader Whose Life Mirrored Nation's, Dies By nasser karimi, associated press TEHRAN, Iran \u0097 Jan 8, 2017, 6:42 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE -- In this Dec. 21, 2015 file photo, former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani waves to journalists as he registers his candidacy for the elections of the Experts Assembly, in Tehran, Iran. Iranian media said Sunday, Jan. 8, 2017, that Rafsanjani, who served as president from 1989 to 1997, has been hospitalized because of a heart condition. The official IRNA news agency reported that Rafsanjani was taken to a public hospital north of the capital, Tehran. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi, File) 0 Shares Email Iran's former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani died Sunday after a decades-long career in the ruling elite, where his moderate views were not always welcome but his cunning guided him through revolution, war and the country's turbulent politics. The political survivor's life spanned the trials of Iran's modern history, from serving as a close aide to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during the 1979 Islamic Revolution to acting as a go-between in the Iran-Contra deal. He helped found Iran's contested nuclear program, but later backed the accord with world powers to limit it in exchange for sanctions relief. Rafsanjani, who showed ruthlessness while in power but later pushed for reforms, died Sunday after suffering a heart attack, state media reported. He was 82. Iranian media said he was hospitalized north of Tehran earlier Sunday, where doctors performed CPR in vain for nearly an hour and a half before declaring him dead. A female state newscaster's voice quivered as she read the news. Rafsanjani, \"after a life full of restless efforts in the path of Islam and revolution, had departed for lofty heaven,\" she said. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Rafsanjani an \"old friend and comrade\" and said his loss is \"difficult and life-decreasing.\" The government announced three days of mourning, and a funeral was expected to be held on Tuesday. Rafsanjani served as president from 1989 to 1997, during a period of significant changes in Iran. At the time, the country was struggling to rebuild its economy after a devastating 1980s war with Iraq, while also cautiously allowing some wider freedoms, as seen in Iran's highly regarded film and media industry. He also oversaw key developments in Iran's nuclear program by negotiating deals with Russia to build an energy-producing reactor in Bushehr, which finally went into service in 2011 after long delays. Behind the scenes, he directed the secret purchase of technology and equipment from Pakistan and elsewhere. In an interview published in October, Rafsanjani acknowledged the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, which killed some 1 million people, led Iran to consider seeking nuclear weapons. \"Our basic doctrine was always for a peaceful nuclear application, but it never left our mind that if one day we should be threatened and it was imperative, we should be able to go down the other path,\" he said. \"But we never went.\" The cleric managed to remain within Iran's ruling theocracy after leaving office, but an attempt to return to the presidency in 2005 was dashed by the electoral victory of the more hard-line Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Rafsanjani was later branded a dissenter by many conservatives for his harsh criticism of the crackdown that followed Ahmadinejad's re-election in 2009. But after years of waning influence, Rafsanjani was handed an unexpected political resurgence with the 2013 victory of a fellow moderate, Hassan Rouhani, giving him an insider role in efforts that would culminate in the 2015 nuclear agreement. Some analysts believe Rafsanjani was kept within the ruling fold as a potential mediator with America and its allies in the standoff over Iran's nuclear program. His past stature as a trusted Khomeini ally also offered him political protection. Rafsanjani was a top commander in the war with Iraq and played a key role in convincing Khomeini to accept a cease-fire after years of crippling stalemate. His image, however, also had darker undertones. He was named by prosecutors in Argentina among Iranian officials suspected of links to a 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people. Some Iranian reformers accused him of involvement in the slaying of liberals and dissidents during his presidency \u2014 charges that he denied and that were never pursued by Iranian authorities. \"The title of Islamic Republic is not just a formality,\" he said in 2009 in the chaos after Ahmadinejad's re-election. \"Rest assured, if one of those two aspects is damaged we will lose our revolution. If it loses its Islamic aspect, we will go astray. If it loses its republican aspect, (the Islamic Republic) will not be realized. Based on the reasons that I have offered, without people and their vote there would be no Islamic system.\" Rafsanjani \u2014 a portly man with only sparse and wispy chin hairs in contrast to the full beards worn by most Islamic clerics in Iran \u2014 first met Khomeini in the Shiite seminaries of Qom in the 1950s and later became a key figure in the Islamic uprising that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979. He was elected as head of Iran's parliament in 1980 and served until 1989, when he was elected for the first of two four-year terms as president. Here, Rafsanjani began to build his multilayered \u2014 and sometimes contradictory \u2014 political nature: A supporter of free enterprise, a relative pragmatist toward foreign affairs and an unforgiving leader who showed no mercy to any challenges to his authority. Rafsanjani took a dim view of state control of the economy, even in the turbulent years after the Islamic Revolution, and he encouraged private businesses, development of Tehran's stock market and ways to boost Iranian exports. He built roads and connected villages to electrical, telephone and water networks for the first time, earning the title of Commander of Reconstruction by his supporters. There were certain self-interests at play as well. Rafsanjani was assumed to be the head of a family-run pistachio business, which grew to become one of Iran's largest exporters and provided the financial foundation for a business empire that would eventually include construction companies, an auto assembly plant, vast real estate holdings and a private airline. In 2003, he was listed among Iran's \"millionaire mullahs\" by Forbes magazine. His economic policies won him praise from Iran's elite and merchant classes, but brought bitterness from struggling workers seeking greater state handouts. Rafsanjani also faced warnings from the ruling theocracy about pushing too far. None of his reforms dared to undercut the vast power of the Revolutionary Guard \u2014 which Rafsanjani briefly commanded, and which controls every key defense and strategic program. Rafsanjani's complex legacy also was shaped by the times. He took over the presidency in a critical time of transition just after the death of Khomeini. He tried to make overtures for better ties with the U.S. after the American-led invasion of Kuwait in 1991 to drive out Iraqi forces, arguing that Iran paid too high a price for its diplomatic freeze with Washington. But he could not overcome opposition from Iranian hard-liners and failed to win the backing of Khomeini's successor as supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for bold foreign policy moves. He also angered the West by strengthening Iran's ties to armed groups such as Lebanon's Hezbollah. \"One of the wrong things we did, in the revolutionary atmosphere, was constantly to make enemies,\" he said in a 1987 interview. \"We pushed those who could have been neutral into hostility.\" Rafsanjani was born in 1934 in the village of Bahraman in southeastern Iran's pistachio-growing region of Rafsanjan. He was jailed for several years under the shah. He then helped organize the network of mullahs that became Khomeini's revolutionary underground. In 1965, he is reputed to have provided the handgun for the assassination of Iran's prime minister, Hassan Ali Mansoor. Only months after the revolution, Rafsanjani was shot once in the stomach by gunmen from one of the groups vying for power amid the political turmoil. He was not seriously wounded \u2014 and neither was his wife, who jumped in front to shield him from the attack. \"Great men of history do not die,\" Khomeini said in announcing that Rafsanjani had survived. During the 1980s, he used his links with Lebanese Shiite extremists to help secure the release of Western hostages in Lebanon and was a key middleman \u2014 identified as \"Raf\" in Pentagon documents \u2014 in the secret Iran-Contra dealings to funnel U.S. arms to Iran in exchange for money used to fund Nicaraguan rebels. Although Rafsanjani was seen by Washington as a potential ice breaker, his views were far from solidly pro-Western and displayed conflicted positions. Shortly after becoming president in 1989, he hinted that Palestinians should kill Westerners to retaliate for Israeli actions in the occupied territories. \"It is not hard to kill Americans or Frenchmen,\" he said. In February 1994, Rafsanjani survived a second assassination attempt. A lone gunman fired at him as he was speaking to mark the 15th anniversary of the revolution. Unhurt and unshaken, Rafsanjani calmed a crowd of thousands and continued his speech. The Iran-Contra fallout is an often-told tale about the dangers of crossing Rafsanjani. After word was leaked to a Beirut magazine about Rafsanjani's involvement, he ordered the arrest of the source, a senior adviser to the ruling clerics named Mehdi Hashemi, for treason and other charges. Hashemi and others were executed in September 1987. Later, however, he was dismayed at the brutal crackdown against opposition groups and others claiming Ahmadinejad won re-election in June 2009 through vote rigging sanctioned by the ruling theocracy. Khamenei decided to throw his backing behind Ahmadinejad, effectively snubbing Rafsanjani and his complaints. Later, Rafsanjani fell short on efforts to mobilize enough moderate clerics in the Assembly of Experts \u2014 the only group with the power to dismiss the supreme leader \u2014 to force possible concessions from Khamenei on the postelection clampdowns. Rafsanjani was forced out of the post in 2011, but remained as head of the Expediency Council, an advisory body that mediates disputes between the parliament and the Guardian Council, a watchdog group controlled by hard-line clerics. However, his family did not escape so easily. In January 2012, a court sentenced Rafsanjani's daughter, Faezeh Hashemi, to six months in prison on charges of criticizing the ruling system. A court in 2015 sentenced his younger son, Mahdi, to a 10-year prison term over embezzlement and security charges. Rafsanjani is survived by his wife, Effat Marashi, and five children. On Sunday night, Rouhani and others visit the hospital to see Rafsanjani one final time before his body was taken to a mosque ahead of burial. \"He was a revolutionary and freedom-seeking cleric who stuck up for the peoples' votes,\" said Saeed Karimi, a supporter outside the hospital. \"It is such a pity that the nation has lost a political leader and guide.\" Others were critical. Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran, said that during Rafsanjani's term as Iran's president more Iranian \"dissidents were assassinated abroad than any other time in the life of the Islamic Republic.\" She said that included the killings of three members of her group. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell and Adam Schreck in Dubai, United Arab Emirates , and Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report. Biographical material in this story was written by former AP staffer Brian Murphy. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Can Evolution Have a \u2018Higher Purpose\u2019? Robert Wright Photo Credit Llu\u00eds Real/Getty Images About 25 years ago, a conversation between me and one of the greatest biologists of the 20th century took a weird turn. I was talking to William D. Hamilton, who was famous for coming up with the theory of \u201ckin selection,\u201d which explains patterns of altruism among close relatives in various species, including ours. This and other seminal ideas had earned Hamilton a place in the pantheon of thinkers who ushered in the modern Darwinian understanding of social behavior. Richard Dawkins, in the preface to his landmark 1976 book,\u201cThe Selfish Gene,\u201d paid tribute to Hamilton and the three other \u201cdominant figures\u201d in social biology whose ideas formed the book\u2019s foundation. I was interviewing Hamilton at the University of Michigan, where he was on sabbatical from Oxford. A video camera was rolling. I had been researching a book about evolutionary psychology, and I was hoping to create a documentary on the subject. The documentary never materialized, and Hamilton died in early 2000 . My interview with him sat unwatched until earlier this year, when I tracked down the tape containing it. During the interview, I was trying to steer Hamilton toward philosophical topics, and at one point he went further than I had expected. He said, \u201cI\u2019m also quite open to the view that there is some kind of ultimate good which is of a religious nature \u2014 that we just have to look beyond what the evolutionary theory tells us and accept promptings of what ultimate good is, coming from some other source.\u201d That\u2019s an unusual thing for a great evolutionary biologist to say, but the most unusual part was still to come. Continue reading the main story Hamilton continued, in his British accent, \u201cI could enlarge on that in terms of the possible existence of extraterrestrial manipulators who interfere, and so on, but I think this would be getting too far from the general topic of discussion.\u201d Well, maybe, but this sounded at least as interesting as the general topic of discussion. I asked him if he meant that there was some kind of \u201ctranscendental purpose\u201d that we humans are generally oblivious to. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He answered: \u201cYes, yes. There\u2019s one theory of the universe that I rather like \u2014 I accept it in an almost joking spirit \u2014 and that is that Planet Earth in our solar system is a kind of zoo for extraterrestrial beings who dwell out there somewhere. And this is the best, the most interesting experiment they could set up: to set up the evolution on Planet Earth going in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters \u2014 humans who go around doing things \u2014 and they watch their experiment, interfering hardly at all so that almost everything we do comes out according to the laws of nature. But every now and then they see something which doesn\u2019t look quite right \u2014 this zoo is going to kill itself off if they let you do this or that.\u201d So, he continued, these extraterrestrials \u201cinsert a finger and just change some little thing. And maybe those are the miracles which the religious people like to so emphasize.\u201d He reiterated: \u201cI put it forward in an almost joking spirit. But I think it\u2019s a kind of hypothesis that\u2019s very, very hard to dismiss.\u201d The headline almost writes itself: \u201cWorld-Class Scientist Says Miracles Can Happen!\u201d The subhead would add: \u201cExtraterrestrials may play a role.\u201d William D. Hamilton, July, 1992 \u00a9 MeaningofLife.tv Video by MeaningofLife.tv But that\u2019s the headline you\u2019d write if you were just trying to maximize clicks. If you wanted to capture the philosophical significance of what Hamilton was saying, you\u2019d take another tack. Rather than focus on miracles, you\u2019d focus on the idea of \u201chigher purpose\u201d \u2014 the idea that there\u2019s some point to life on earth that emanates from something that is in some sense beyond it. And \u2014 in hopes of generating as many clicks as possible, notwithstanding the philosophical significance \u2014 you\u2019d put this in listicle form, laying out several misconceptions that Hamilton had implicitly dispelled. You could call these the \u201cThree Great Myths About Evolution and Purpose.\u201d Myth number one: To say that there\u2019s in some sense a \u201chigher purpose\u201d means there are \u201cspooky forces\u201d at work. When I ask scientifically minded people if they think life on earth may have some larger purpose, they typically say no. If I ask them to explain their view, it often turns out that they think that answering yes would mean departing from a scientific worldview \u2014 embracing the possibility of supernatural beings or, at the very least, of immaterial factors that lie beyond scientific measurement. But Hamilton\u2019s thought experiment shows that this isn\u2019t necessarily so. You may consider aliens spooky, but they\u2019re not a spooky force. And they\u2019re not supernatural beings. They\u2019re just physical beings, like us. Their technology is so advanced that their interventions might seem miraculous to us \u2014 as various smartphone apps would seem to my great-, great-grandparents \u2014 but these interventions would in fact comply with the laws of science. More to the point: If you ask how Hamilton\u2019s aliens had initially imparted \u201cpurpose\u201d to life, the answer is that they did so in concrete fashion: by planting simple self-replicating material on earth a few billion years ago, confident that it would lead to something that would keep them entertained (keeping them entertained being, in this scenario, life\u2019s purpose). Which leads to: Myth number two: To say that evolution has a purpose is to say that it is driven by something other than natural selection.

You are already subscribed to this email. Privacy Policy The correction of this misconception is in some ways just a corollary of the correction of the first misconception, but it\u2019s worth spelling out: Evolution can have a purpose even if it is a wholly mechanical, material process \u2014 that is, even if its sole engine is natural selection. After all, clocks have purposes \u2014 to keep time, a purpose imparted by clockmakers \u2014 and they\u2019re wholly mechanical. Of course, to suggest that evolution involves the unfolding of some purpose is to suggest that evolution has in some sense been heading somewhere \u2014 namely, toward the realization of its purpose. Which leads to: Myth number three: Evolution couldn\u2019t have a purpose, because it doesn\u2019t have a direction. The idea that evolution is fundamentally directionless is widespread, in part because one great popularizer of evolution, Stephen Jay Gould, worked hard to leave that impression. As I and others have argued , Gould was at best misleading on this point. And, anyway, even Gould admitted that, yes, on balance evolution tends to create beings of greater and greater complexity. A number of evolutionary biologists would go further and say that evolution was likely, given long enough, to create animals as intelligent as us. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In fact, that idea is implicit in Hamilton\u2019s saying the aliens could have \u201cset up\u201d evolution in such a way that \u201cit would produce these really interesting characters \u2014 humans.\u201d This part of Hamilton\u2019s scenario requires no intervention on the part of the aliens, because he believed that evolution by natural selection has a kind of direction in the sense that it is likely, given long enough, to produce very intelligent forms of life. (When speaking more precisely, as he did in other parts of the interview, Hamilton would say that the human species per se wasn\u2019t in the cards \u2014 that it wasn\u2019t inevitable that the first intelligent species would look like us.) With these three myths dispelled, you\u2019re left with this philosophically liberating upshot: You can entertain the possibility that evolution has a purpose, a kind of goal (a \u201ctelos,\u201d as philosophers say), without departing from a strictly Darwinian view of evolution \u2014 without abandoning belief in natural selection as evolution\u2019s only engine, and without surrendering your credentials as a modern, scientifically minded kind of person. In case you\u2019re still feeling a little uneasy about becoming a purpose ponderer, I should emphasize that not all teleological scenarios that pass scientific muster involve space aliens. Indeed, some scientists have suggested that natural selection has a purpose that wasn\u2019t instilled by any kind of intelligent being. This scenario emerges from one version of physicist Lee Smolin\u2019s theory of \u201ccosmological natural selection.\u201d Smolin thinks our universe may itself be a product of a kind of evolution: maybe universes can replicate themselves via black holes, so over time \u2014 over a lot of time \u2014 you get universes whose physical laws are more and more conducive to replication. (So that\u2019s why our universe is so good at black-hole making!) In some variants of Smolin\u2019s theory \u2014 such as those developed by the late cosmologist Edward Harrison and the mathematician Louis Crane \u2014 intelligent beings can play a role in this replication once their technology reaches a point where they can produce black holes. So through cosmological natural selection you\u2019d get universes whose physical properties were more and more conducive to the evolution of intelligent life. This might explain the much-discussed observation that the physical constants of this universe seem \u201cfine-tuned\u201d to permit the emergence of life. Crane, in a recent dialogue on my website meaningoflife.tv , told me that in this scenario \u201chuman life\u2014and I don\u2019t mean on an individual scale, but as a whole\u2014has a purpose in the same sense that a chicken\u2019s egg has a purpose. The purpose of a chicken\u2019s egg is to create a chicken.\u201d Crane isn\u2019t using language carelessly here. Some philosophers are comfortable talking about animals having a \u201cpurpose\u201d imbued by natural selection (to spread their genes). So if biological evolution is a product of cosmological natural selection, it has a purpose in a defensible sense of that term\u2014and we\u2019re part of that purpose. So add another item to our listicle: Myth number four: If evolution has a purpose, the purpose must have been imbued by an intelligent being. That said, one interesting feature of current discourse is a growing openness among some scientifically minded people to the possibility that our world has a purpose that was imparted by an intelligent being. I\u2019m referring to \u201csimulation\u201d scenarios, which hold that our seemingly tangible world is actually a kind of projection emanating from some sort of mind-blowingly powerful computer; and the history of our universe, including evolution on this planet, is the unfolding of a computer algorithm whose author must be pretty bright. You may scoff, but in 2003 the philosopher Nick Bostrom of Oxford University published a paper laying out reasons to think that we are pretty likely to be living in a simulation. And the simulation hypothesis has gained influential supporters. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and America\u2019s de facto astronomer laureate, finds it plausible. The visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk says there\u2019s almost no chance that we\u2019re living in \u201cbase reality.\u201d The New Yorker reported earlier this year that \u201ctwo tech billionaires\u201d \u2014 it didn\u2019t say whether Musk is one of them \u2014 \u201chave gone so far as to secretly engage scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story I\u2019m guessing that will take awhile, and meanwhile I\u2019d like to note an irony. When an argument for higher purpose is put this way \u2014 that is, when it doesn\u2019t involve the phrase \u201chigher purpose\u201d and, further, is cast more as a technological scenario than a metaphysical one \u2014 it is considered intellectually respectable. I don\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t plenty of people who dismiss it. I\u2019m talking about how people dismiss it. The Bostrom paper drew flack, but a lot of it was from people who thought the chances that we\u2019re living in a simulation are way less than 50 percent, not from people who thought the idea was wholly crazy. If you walked up to the same people who gave Bostrom a respectful hearing and told them there is a transcendent God, many would dismiss the idea out of hand. Yet the simulation hypothesis is a God hypothesis: An intelligence of awe-inspiring power created our universe for reasons we can speculate about but can\u2019t entirely fathom. And, assuming this intelligence still exists, it is in some sense outside of our reality \u2014 beyond the reach of our senses \u2014 and yet, presumably, it has the power to intervene in our world. Theology has entered \u201csecular\u201d discourse under another name. Personally, I\u2019m fine with that. I think discussion of higher purpose should be respectable even in a scientific age. I don\u2019t mean I buy the simulation scenario in particular, or the space alien scenario, or the cosmological natural selection scenario. But I do think there\u2019s reason to suspect that there\u2019s some point to this exercise we Earthlings are engaged in, some purpose imbued by something \u2014 and that, even if identifying that something is for now hopeless, there are grounds for speculating about what the point of the exercise is. I won\u2019t elaborate much on this, since I\u2019ve done that elsewhere , arguing that higher purpose can be framed as a hypothesis, and that evidence for or against the hypothesis can be marshaled. But I will say that the evidence I see for purpose includes not just the direction of biological evolution, but the direction of technological evolution and of the broader social and cultural evolution it drives \u2014 the evolution that has carried us from hunter-gatherer bands to the brink of a cohesive global community. And if the purpose involves sustaining this direction \u2014 becoming a true global community \u2014 then it would seem to include moral progress. In particular, our purpose would involve transcending the psychology of tribalism that can otherwise divide people along ethnic, national, religious and ideological lines. Which would mean \u2014 in light of recent political and social developments in the United States and abroad \u2014 that our work is cut out for us.

One of the big issues the GOP is facing: Many of the communities with the biggest increases in health insurance coverage since 2008 were Republican-leaning places that voted for President-elect Donald Trump. In December, a Wall Street Journal story outlined how many counties that voted heavily for Trump also saw increases in health insurance coverage greater than the overall national increase. Those counties, categorized by the American Communities Project , were largely rural and white, with many holding large evangelical populations, and scattered throughout the key states that won Trump the presidency. Below is a look at some counties in swing states that went heavily for Trump and that also saw noteworthy drops in their uninsured rates during Barack Obama's time in the White House. Data from Gallup showed that between 2008 and 2016, there was a 3.9% decrease in the number of uninsured Americans. All these counties saw larger drops than that between 2008 and 2014, according to numbers for the Census Small Area Health Insurance Estimates. There are many more. (The most recent set of data is from 2014.) To be clear, an increase in coverage does not necessarily equal support for the ACA. Just because people follow a government mandate doesn't mean they support the mandate. But the data suggest that if the ACA is \"repealed\" and not \"replaced,\" communities that voted for Trump would see some of the biggest drops in coverage. That's likely one of the big reasons why the \"replace\" part of the GOP equation has gotten much more of the attention recently. Just this past week, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway stressed that, \"We don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance.\" Opposing the ACA is one thing. But taking away health coverage is not the kind of approach that keeps current voters happy or wins new ones. That's the complicated terrain the GOP now finds itself facing as it tackles Obamacare. And as the idea of \"repeal and replace\" gets closer to reality, you can expect those political concerns to exert an increasingly strong pull on the coming Trump administration and the new Washington.

That part is right. I don't think it should be a military or purely military response,\" he said. And he warned that North Korea's nuclear weapons capabilities are a \"serious threat\" to the nation. \"Their nuclear weapons and ballistic missile defense programs are a serious threat to us. We try to stay ahead of that and we are staying ahead of that with our missile defenses to make sure we've upgraded their number, their type, so that we're sure we can defend ourselves,\" he said. Carter said the Defense Department's job is \"to stay one step ahead of the North Koreans,\" and that they're prepared to shoot down a North Korea missile launch or test \"if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of our friends and allies.\" Play ",

Anadolu Agency/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Iraqis inspect the scene of a Sunday car bomb attack at a Baghdad market. Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Several bombings tore through Iraq's capital city just hours apart on Sunday. The attacks in and around Baghdad, which are believed to have primarily targeted Shiite Muslims, killed more than two dozen people and left dozens more wounded. Early Sunday in Sadr City, a predominantly Shiite suburb, Iraqi government officials say an attacker drove a car rigged with explosives into a large fruit and vegetable market. \"A soldier at the gate of Jamila market opened fire on a suicide car bomb after noticing a suspect vehicle but the terrorist blew up his car,\" Iraq's interior ministry spokesman Saad Maan said, according to Agence France-Presse. Al-Jazeera reports that at least 12 people were killed and 50 more \u2014 including the soldier who opened fire on the car \u2014 were wounded in the bombing. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted online. Shortly afterward, a suicide bomber detonated explosives at a market elsewhere in the city, in another predominantly Shiite neighborhood, according to The Associated Press . The AP says nine shoppers were killed and another 16 wounded in that bombing, adding: \"Three additional bombings in and around the capital killed seven people and wounded 24 others.\" Article continues after sponsorship No group has immediately claimed responsibility for those attacks, but they, too, are believed to be the work of ISIS, which has conducted a campaign of concentrated violence in Baghdad in recent weeks. In fact, Sadr City was targeted with another suicide bombing just days ago. The Islamic State, a group of Sunni jihadi militants, considers Shiite Muslims to be apostates and frequently targets members of the religious sect. ISIS has escalated its attacks on civilians even as it has lost territory in recent months. In Mosul, one of the militant group's last major strongholds, government forces pushed jihadi fighters back to the Tigris River for the first time Sunday, Reuters reports , citing an Iraqi special forces spokesman: \"It was the first time Iraqi forces in the city itself have reached the river, which bisects Mosul, since the offensive to drive out Islamic State was launched in October. Iraqi forces already control the Tigris to Mosul's south. \"The CTS [Iraq's elite counterterrorism service] has spearheaded advances inside Mosul and is part of a 100,000-strong force backed by U.S. air power of Iraqi troops, Kurdish fighters and Shi'ite militias fighting the militants. After a period of stuttering advances in Mosul, Iraqi forces have gained momentum in a new push since around the start of the year.\" ",

The 22-second recording, first obtained by TMZ , shows a man casually strolling among travelers before taking out the pistol. The man is able to fire his gun several times as others barely have a chance to react. You can see horror on people's faces as they begin to realize what is going on, then they try to run and find cover wherever they can. A blurred out figure appears to stumble onscreen as a result of the shooting. Five people were killed and six more were injured in the shooting. Esteban Santiago, 26, has been charged with performing an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation and two other counts, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida said. The charges could lead to the death penalty if he is convicted. Related: 'We Have to Do More': Defense Secretary Carter on PTSD in Wake of Airport Shooting A screengrab of surveillance footage shows Esteban Santiago as he fires his first shots in the baggage claim area of Florida's Ft. Lauderdale International Airport, Jan. 6, 2017. Footage courtesy of TMZ In an interview with Santiago, investigators learned that the Iraq War veteran had planned the attack and traveled from Anchorage with just the handgun and two magazines in his check luggage. Court documents revealed that Santiago told the FBI after the shooting that he planned the attack, and had purchased a one-way ticket from Anchorage, Alaska \u2014 his luggage was a legally checked Walther 9mm handgun and two magazines of ammunition. According to a criminal complaint, Santiago told the FBI that after landing he retrieved the checked handgun case from baggage claim, went to a bathroom and loaded the weapon, then tucked it into his waistband. He told investigators that he shot the first people he saw when he left the restroom, the complaint states. Phil McCausland ",

    "text": "DEC. 30, 2016 The typical American diet includes far too much added sugar. Can you stay under a healthy limit? I\u2019ve recently tried to reduce the sugar I eat , having been persuaded by the research on its damages \u2014 and alarmed by how much sugar has snuck into our diet. To give you a sense of how common it is, we\u2019ve created a challenge: Construct a day\u2019s worth of eating, from items at a typical supermarket we visited, that meets the guidelines for added sugars. Health experts recommend most adults eat no more than 50 grams (that\u2019s 12-and-a-half teaspoons) of added sugars per day \u2014 and, ideally, closer to 25 . Unfortunately, food companies aren\u2019t ( yet ) required to disclose how much added sugars are in their products. They must disclose only total sugars, including the natural ones in fruits, vegetables and dairy. But that still lets you make good decisions. That\u2019s because while the reality is that natural sugars aren\u2019t much healthier than added sugars, experts focus on added sugar because Americans don\u2019t tend to overeat fruit and vegetables. A useful rule of thumb is: Don\u2019t worry about anything with only natural sugar. (In this challenge, we haven't.) So get to work. Pick food for three meals and, if you\u2019d like \u2014 and have the sugar to spare \u2014 a snack and dessert. Good luck! Choose items to eat for each meal breakfast ",

(Photo: Patrick Dove, Treasure Coast Newspapers) It begins like any normal scene on a Friday afternoon at a busy U.S. airport. Tired travelers\u00a0rolling\u00a0luggage or shouldering backpacks through a baggage terminal. One man casually strolls through, talking on his cellphone, while two young\u00a0children plod along ahead of him. Until a bearded man in a long-sleeve\u00a0blue shirt and black pants walks into view, picks up his pace, pulls\u00a0a semiautomatic handgun from his\u00a0waistband, turns to the right \u2014 and starts to fire. Video of First Shots in Ft. Lauderdale Shooting (VIDEO) https://t.co/G2VJYqCtoJ \u2014 TMZ (@TMZ) January 8, 2017 A\u00a0dramatic video that emerged Sunday, broadcast by TMZ and CNN and taken from what appears to be surveillance video at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood\u00a0International Airport, shows\u00a0the\u00a0first few seconds of Friday's shooting rampage. The shooting begins 12 seconds into the 22-second video. After the first shots are fired, the gunman disappears from view, and for a split-second some stunned travelers freeze. One jumps and clasps her hands to her ears. Everyone then\u00a0scatters through the terminal, some taking cover behind the baggage carousel, others grabbing fellow travelers and diving\u00a0to the ground. A few try to\u00a0seek\u00a0shelter behind\u00a0a luggage trolley. Some race up an escalator or staircase. Esteban Santiago, 26, was arrested in the incident that resulted in\u00a0five deaths and six people injured. Santiago is accused\u00a0of an act of violence at an international airport resulting in death, along with\u00a0two firearms offenses. More charges are likely as the investigation into the attack continues. Santiago will be arraigned on Monday.

In a report released by the intelligence community Friday, U.S. officials said they \"assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.\" \"I think that what is true is that the Russians intended to meddle and they meddled,\" Obama said on ABC. He also warned against letting partisanship undermine faith in U.S. intelligence-gathering. \"One of the things I am concerned about is the degree to which we\u2019ve seen a lot of commentary lately where there are Republicans or pundits or cable commentators who seem to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans are Democrats,\" Obama said. \"That cannot be.\" Obama acknowledged that he underestimated Russia's hacking abilities. \"I don't think I underestimated (Vladimir Putin), but I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation, for cyber hacking and so forth, to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating,\" he said. Obama urged Trump and Congress to strengthen the nation's cybersecurity and prevent any more foreign interference in U.S. elections. \u201cI think it's important that Congress, on a bipartisan basis, work with the next administration, looking forward to make sure that this kind of (foreign) influence is minimized,\" the president said. \"We have to remind ourselves we\u2019re on the same team. Vladimir Putin\u2019s not on our team.\" Obama also said he has talked to Trump about Trump's fondness for using Twitter to communicate with the American people. \"I've said to him, and I think others have said to him, that the day that he is the president of the United States, there are world capitals and financial markets and people all around the world who take really seriously what he says, and in a way that's just not true before you're actually sworn in as president,\" Obama said. Obama said he told Trump that running the country is much different than running a business. \"You can't manage it the way you would manage a family business,\" Obama said. \"You have to have a strong team around you. You have to have respect for institutions and the process to make good decisions because you are inherently reliant on other folks.\" The president said his private conversations with the incoming commander-in-chief have been \"cordial\" and that Trump has been open to his advice. \"The main thing that I've tried to transmit is that there's a difference between governing and campaigning, so that what he has to appreciate is as soon as you walk into this office after you've been sworn in, you're now in charge of the largest organization on Earth,\" Obama said. Obama said he and Trump are opposite in many ways but that they have one big thing in common \u2014 confidence. \"It's probably a prerequisite for the job, or at least you have to have enough craziness to think that you can do the job,\" Obama said.

Just before 5 a.m. Sunday, a 21-year-old man in Terminal 3 of the second-busiest airport in the country breached a checkpoint and tried to get on an airplane. Chicago police said the man\u2019s attempt was unsuccessful \u2013 he never boarded an aircraft. Officers stopped the man from entering the gate. The man then attacked officers and hit them in their faces and bodies, according to a news release. Two Chicago police officers and two Transportation Security Administration agents were battered by the man, according to police. One Chicago officer was taken to Presence Resurrection Medical Center for treatment of injuries to the face and a Chicago sergeant was treated at the scene; treatment information for the TSA agents was not released.\u00a0 The man was taken into custody and directed to Presence Resurrection\u00a0Hospital for evaluation. On Friday, five people were killed and six others were wounded in a shooting at\u00a0Florida\u2019s Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport . Authorities arrested Esteban Santiago , 26, of Anchorage, Alaska, who faces\u00a0three federal charges\u00a0that hold the death penalty as the maximum sentence. Though he complied with regulations and declared his handgun when departing Anchorage, Santiago is accused of taking his weapon out of its firearms case and loading it inside a Fort Lauderdale airport bathroom, from which he came out shooting, according to witness accounts. Santiago, who was extensively interviewed by authorities in the aftermath of the mass shooting, had trouble controlling his anger after serving in Iraq and told his brother that he felt he was being chased and controlled by the CIA through secret online messages. When he told agents at an FBI field office his paranoid thoughts in November, he was evaluated for four days, then released without any follow-up medication or therapy. Authorities continue to investigate the unrelated Chicago case. ",

Don\u2019t believe it, one longtime Clinton confidante said Sunday -- 2016 was Clinton\u2019s last campaign ever. \u201cI don\u2019t expect her to ever run for any elected office again,\u201d Neera Tanden, the head of the think tank the Center for American Progress and a former top Clinton aide, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Tanden was asked about the New York City mayor possibility after the New York Post editorial board ran a piece encouraging her to challenge incumbent Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio, who will be up for reelection this fall. \u201cNew York City needs Hillary Clinton to run for mayor,\u201d the editorial board wrote. It\u2019s not just the Post, either: New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote a column imagining the clashes between a mayor Clinton and President Trump in New York City. \u201cThe potholes near his properties go unfilled. Those neighborhoods are the last to be plowed. There\u2019s a problem with the flow of water to his Bronx golf course, whose greens are suddenly brown,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd the Russian Consulate keeps experiencing power failures.\u201d Tanden said Clinton, who has kept a low profile since Election Day, won\u2019t recede entirely from public life -- but that she\u2019ll likely focus on her work for children and families, rather than pure politics. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to figure out ways to help kids and families,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s been what she\u2019s been focused on her whole life, and a lot of issues that are affecting them, over the next couple of years.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Trump's Cabinet nominees get their day before Senate, as partisan wrangling intensifies Published               January 08, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Confirmation hearings begin this week on Capitol Hill for Alabama Sen. Jeff Session as U.S. attorney general and other Cabinet picks from President-elect Donald Trump -- amid increasing partisan threats about derailing nominees and calls to keep politics out of the process. The most recent exchange began Saturday when Democrats called for a delay in the hearings -- including at least seven this week -- because several of Trump\u2019s nominees have purportedly failed to complete ethics reviews to avoid conflicts of interest. Democrats called for the delay based on letter this weekend from the Office of Government Ethics to Senate leaders stating that some of the nominees scheduled for hearings have yet to complete their ethics review process. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday the complaints are merely \u201cprocedural\u201d and are being raised by Democrats frustrated about him and fellow Republicans now controlling the House, Senate and White House. \"I understand that. But we need to sort of grow up here and get past that,\u201d the Kentucky senator told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe confirmed seven Cabinet appointments the day President Obama was sworn in. We didn't like most of them either. But he won the election.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the ethics review is to ensuring wealthy Cabinet members work for the American people instead of \"their own bottom line and that they plan to fully comply with the law.\" Republicans are intent on getting as Trump nominees through the arduous confirmation process before the incoming Republican president takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. Several of Trump\u2019s picks are wealth Americans with far-reaching business connections -- Republican mega-donor Betsy DeVos, for education secretary; ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson, for secretary of state; Billionaire private-equity investor Wilbur Ross, for commerce secretary and former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin for treasury secretary. Despite all of the wrangling ahead of the Senate confirmation hearings, Trump\u2019s nominees will almost certainly get enough votes in the chamber's GOP-led committees. However, they could run into delays when both parties cast final votes on the Senate floor, despite needing only 51 \u201cyeahs.\u201d Democrats could use procedural moves to extend the debate on each of the nominees. But they don\u2019t have the power to use the filibuster to block the nominations, because in the last Congress they changed the threshold on such filibusters from 60 to 51 votes. The hearings begin Tuesday with Sessions in the Senate Judiciary Committee, the same panel that in 1986 denied him a federal judgeship, following allegations that he had made racist remarks and called the NAACP \"un-American.\" Still, Session, an immigration hawk and the first U.S. Senator to endorse Trump, a fellow Republican, is expected to be confirmed without much delay or fight. Still, civil rights groups are urging a thorough vetting of Sessions. Last week, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks and other group members were arrested after a sit-in protest in Sessions' Mobile, Alabama, office, and could do something similar on Capitol Hill. \u00a0 The two-day hearing includes a day for Sessions to address the committee, and a day for rebuttal witnesses from those opposing his nomination. Session will be followed Tuesday by retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, the nominee for the post of Homeland Security secretary. Tillerson\u2019s hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to run the State Department, arguable the most important and high-profile Cabinet post, could be the most contentious. His job leading oil giant ExxonMobile, which included deals with Russia and connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is raising concerns, especially after a recent U.S. intelligence report stated both meddled in this year\u2019s presidential election. However, the expected showdown with Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain -- who last week suggested he\u2019d vote for Tillerson when \u201cpigs fly\u201d -- appears less likely. McCain said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that still has questions but that a meeting last week with Tillerson eased concerns. \u201cEvery president should have the benefit of the doubt as to their nominees,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there has to be a compelling reason not\u201d to vote for him. Democrats and others argue that Ross, who founded the private equity firm WL Ross & Co., is the type of Wall Street tycoon that Trump has vowed to keep out of Washington. But Ross' record has so far shown no potentially damaging conflicts of interest. Schumer and other Democrats have purportedly targeted DeVos, Sessions and Tillerson as well as Mnuchin and South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, for the Office of Management -- whose hearings have yet to be scheduled. \u201cIf Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they\u2019re sorely mistaken,\u201d Schumer said last week. One of the committees that hasn't yet received the ethics review forms is the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which will hold the DeVos hearings. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee said it had also not received the forms for Ross, though a spokeswoman said they expect them soon. Committee aides said they have received ethics forms for Sessions, Tillerson, Treasury Secretary nominee and retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis and Elaine Chao, for transportation secretary. The Government Ethics office did not list which of Trump's Cabinet choices hadn't turned in their disclosures. Other confirmation hearings next week include Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Ben Carson for housing secretary. The Associated Press contributed to his report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

U.S. Navy Capt. Bill Salvin, a spokesman for the U.S. mission in Afghanistan , said the Marines will begin deploying this year and will remain in the province for nine months, where they will work with the Afghan army and militarized national police. \"The Marine Corps has a long operational history in Afghanistan, particularly in Helmand Province. Advising and assisting Afghan defense and security forces will assist in preserving gains made together with the Afghans,\" he said. The U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of 2014, but thousands of troops remain in the country, where they train and assist Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism operations. The Taliban are battling Afghan forces on a number of fronts, and the fighting has been particularly intense in Helmand, where the insurgents have repeatedly assaulted the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, in recent months. Helmand is the main source of poppies for Afghanistan's thriving opium trade, which is worth an estimated $4 billion a year, much of which funds the insurgency. Provincial officials estimate the Taliban controls 85 percent of the province, up from just 20 percent a year ago. In northern Afghanistan, meanwhile, a roadside bomb killed two police officers and wounded another three, according to Sakhi Dad Haidari, head of the Badakhshan province's criminal investigation department. The Taliban claimed the attack. Over the past week, Afghan forces have been carrying out clearing operations in different parts of the province. Haidari said around a dozen insurgents have been killed and wounded. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is rejecting bipartisan calls for a special committee to investigate Russian interference in the U.S. election, which American intelligence says was aimed in part at helping Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton . The likely meddling by Russia... Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is rejecting bipartisan calls for a special committee to investigate Russian interference in the U.S. election, which American intelligence says was aimed in part at helping Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton . The likely meddling by Russia... (Tribune news services) But Senate Republicans strongly disputed Shaub, noting that at least some hearings have been held before the OGE completed reviewing a nominee's past. Take the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, for example. The panel requires a nominee to complete a questionnaire - part of which is released publicly, while a portion containing personal information remains private. The committee also requires that a nominee undergo an ethics review by the OGE and an FBI criminal background check. In January 2001, the committee held a confirmation hearing for Roderick Paige, George W. Bush's choice to lead the Education Department, eight days before the OGE completed its review, aides said. That month, the committee met with Elaine Chao , tapped to serve as Bush's labor secretary, five days before the OGE sent its findings to Capitol Hill. This year, Chao is nominated to serve as Trump's transportation secretary, and her ethics and FBI background checks have been completed ahead of her hearing, scheduled for Wednesday with the Senate Commerce Committee, aides said. Her hearing will occur amid a flurry of other televised meetings with Trump nominees, including Sen. Jeff Sessions , R-Ala., to be the next attorney general, set to meet with the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, and Rex Tillerson to serve as secretary of state, set to appear before the Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. All of Sessions's paperwork is completed, including the FBI background check, according to Senate aides. Tillerson turned in his ethics report a few days after being nominated but is awaiting the results of an FBI check, said those aides, who are not authorized to speak publicly about the reviews. Betsy DeVos, Trump's choice for education secretary, has yet to submit her ethics report, but her FBI check is completed ahead of her Wednesday hearing with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, aides said. Paperwork for retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security, also has been completed ahead of his Wednesday hearing. On Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee will meet with Ben Carson, Trump's choice to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, while the Senate Commerce Committee will meet with Wilbur Ross, Trump's choice to lead the Commerce Department. Both nominees are still undergoing ethics and FBI reviews, aides said. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., on Sunday again faulted Republicans for the confirmation schedule. \"No administration, Republican or Democrat, has tried to do what these Republicans are trying to do with their nominees,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"Rather than ensuring that nominees are thoroughly vetted and will remove themselves from conflicts of interests, Senate Republicans are trying to ram them through as quickly as possible.\" \"Until these nominees have fully cooperated with the ethics review process, the hearings and confirmation schedule should not be rushed,\" he added. A former general counsel and acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, Don W. Fox , said his former agency should not be faulted for slowing down the confirmation of Trump's Cabinet. \"I would not fault OGE at all\" for this circumstance, he said. \"There is no lack of sophistication there among the staff on complex financial arrangements. But it is a small agency, and the laws are exacting.\" As a result, cooperation and communication with the agency are required, Fox said. Given the number of wealthy nominees and reports of a lack of communication between the ethics office and Trump's team, \"it's not surprising that this is where we are,\" he added.

Brotman, who learned last week that he\u2019ll be replaced by a younger, vocal Trump supporter, said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d about the inauguration committee\u2019s decision. \u201cI was destroyed,\u201d he told local Washington D.C. news station WJLA. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 60 years.\u201d Brotman, who has been the lead announcer for 11 presidents\u2019 inaugural parades, will still be honored as the \u201cannouncer chairman emeritus,\u201d according to a statement from the presidential inaugural committee\u2019s director of communications, Boris Epshteyn. Brotman was offered a VIP seat as well. But the new voice of the parade will be 58-year-old Steve Ray, a Trump campaign volunteer who\u2019s also a local freelance announcer and audio engineer. \u201cWe are thrilled for Steve Ray to be introducing a new generation of Americans to the grand traditions of the inaugural parade,\u201d Epshteyn said in his statement. The job, according to a Washington Post report, is unpaid. Brotman seemed to attribute the replacement as \u201cageism,\u201d he said in an interview with The Daily Beast. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re afraid I might drop dead at the mic,\u201d he suggested. But the inauguration icon, also known for his time as an announcer for the Washington Senators baseball team, said he wishes Ray the best on Jan. 20. \u201cI want [Ray] to do good,\u201d Brotman told WJLA. \u201cAs opposed to, boy, I hope he fouls up so they say, \u2018We want Charlie back.\u2019 No. I don\u2019t want that at all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m saying, \u2018You know what? Good luck, young man. I hope you do spectacular,\u2019\u201d he said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Visiting the attack site, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was strong evidence the attacker was a supporter of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) and suggested a link to previous vehicle attacks in Europe. \u201cWe know that there is a sequence of terror attacks. There definitely could be a connection between them, from France to Berlin and now Jerusalem,\u201d he said. Netanyahu offered no evidence to support the claim. While Israel has arrested several Palestinians who allegedly traveled to Syria to join ISIS, the group is not known to have any serious presence in Israel or the Palestinian areas. Israel has said that two gunmen who carried out a deadly attack in Tel Aviv last June were also inspired by ISIS.\u00a0 The attacker, identified as 28-year-old Fadi Qunbar, came from the Palestinian neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber in east Jerusalem -- located near the attack site. The\u00a0 Palestinian Hamas movement \u00a0praised the truck-ramming attack, but did not claim responsibility. \u00a0 Hamas spokesman Abdul-Latif Qanou called it a \u201cheroic\u201d act and encouraged other Palestinians to do the same and \u201cescalate the resistance.\u201d Qanou says Sunday\u2019s attack proves the wave of Palestinian violence has not ended, despite a recent lull. He says \u201cit may be quiet, it may linger, but it will never end.\u201d Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, is pledged to Israel\u2019s destruction. Paramedic Chen Lendi Sharon was among the first to arrive on the scene of the Jerusalem attack and described 10 bodies trapped beneath the truck. Israel\u2019s rescue service MDA said the four casualties were in their 20s and included three women and a man. Of the 15 wounded, one was in serious condition. Israel\u2019s police chief Roni Alsheich told reporters the attacker was from an Arab neighborhood in east Jerusalem and forces had no advance warning. He refused to elaborate and a gag order was placed on further details pending an investigation. It would rank as one of the deadliest in a more than yearlong wave of Palestinian shooting, stabbing and vehicular attacks against Israelis that had slowed of late. Sunday\u2019s incident marks the first Israeli deaths in three months. On Friday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, invited Trump to visit the West Bank and urged him not to move the embassy. Abbas said that doing so would mark a \u201cred line that we don\u2019t accept.\u201d He promised to use all \u201cdiplomatic and political tools\u201d to fight any such move, but ruled out a violent response, saying \u201cwe renounce terrorism.\u201d Since September 2015, Palestinian attackers have killed 40 Israelis and two visiting Americans. During that time, 230 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire. Israel says most of the Palestinians killed were attackers while the rest died in clashes. The Palestinians and rights groups have accused Israel of using excessive force in some confrontations. Israel says the violence is driven by a Palestinian campaign of incitement, while Palestinians say it\u2019s the result of nearly 50 years of Israeli occupation and dwindling hopes for an independent state . \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Former Army reservist Esteban Santiago, 26, walked into an Alaska FBI office with his infant child on Nov. 7 \"to report that his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency,\" Special Agent in Charge Marlin Ritzman told reporters Saturday. Agents then called Anchorage police, who retrieved a gun from his car outside. \"Santiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS,\" Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley said in a news conference Saturday. Esteban Ruiz Santiago, 26, in a police booking photo. Broward County Sheriff's Office / AP The FBI confirmed that Santiago's child was taken into the \"constant custody and care of the FBI\" until Santiago's girlfriend, the child's mother, could pick him up. His brother Bryan Santiago told NBC News partner Telemundo in Puerto Rico that Esteban was taken by police to a mental health evaluation but was released after only four days. Police returned the handgun to him one month later, officials said. On Sunday, federal law enforcement sources told NBC News that they believe that the gun authorities seized was the same weapon he allegedly used in Friday's shootings, a Walther 9mm pistol. Ritzman said it's normal for people to deliver walk-in complaints at FBI offices across the country. He added that nothing in Santiago's actions or history indicated a need to do anything more than to take him to the mental health facility.

I want to be clear, during our initial investigation we found no ties to terrorism,\" Ritzman said. \"He broke no laws when he came into our office making disjointed comments about mind control.\" In January 2016, however, Santiago was arrested and charged with assault and criminal mischief after a violent argument with his girlfriend in Anchorage. She told investigators that he broke down the door, choked her and hit her on the side of the head. Nevertheless, on Nov. 17, Anchorage police sent Santiago a letter inviting him to pick up his gun from evidence lockup, Tolley said. The former soldier went by the police station on Nov. 30 to pick up his weapon. But law enforcement officials said Santiago was unable to leave with his weapon that day, as police felt compelled to discuss the issue with the local FBI office. Police then made an appointment with Santiago for Dec. 8 to pick up his weapon. The U.S. attorney for Alaska, Karen Loeffler, said federal law requires that someone be \"adjudicated mentally ill\" for him or her to be prohibited from owning a handgun, which she said is difficult. Surveillance video shows Esteban Santiago as he fires his first shots in the baggage claim area of Florida's Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport on Friday. TMZ \"This is not somebody that would have been prohibited [from having a gun] based on the information that they had,\" she said. \"Law enforcement acted within the laws that they had.\" In interviews with the gunman, law enforcement officials learned that Santiago had planned the horrific attack. He traveled from Anchorage to Fort Lauderdale with just the handgun and two magazines legally in his checked baggage, which he took to the bathroom to assemble. In a chilling video obtained by TMZ , Santiago is seen walking casually in baggage claim with the weapon tucked in his waistband. He then pulls it out and begins shooting. Related: Fort Lauderdale Shooting: Three Victims Were Headed to Vacations Santiago told law enforcement that he believes he fired 15 rounds before being arrested. Five people were killed, and six others were wounded. The U.S. attorney's office for southern Florida has charged him with performing an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation and two other counts. If he's convicted, Santiago could face the death penalty. Phil McCausland ",

    "text": "No film has won more than four Globes since 1979, when the crime drama \u201cMidnight Express\u201d received six, the previous record-holding number. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI\u2019m in a daze now officially,\u201d said the force behind \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Damien Chazelle, 31, as he accepted the directing award. Noting the \u201cLa La Land\u201d plot \u2014 star-crossed dreamers try to make it in show business \u2014 Emma Stone said in accepting the award for best actress in a musical or comedy, \u201cI think that hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world, and that\u2019s what this movie is about.\u201d \u201cLa La Land,\u201d made by Lionsgate, also won Globes for song, score, screenplay and actor. The bliss felt by the \u201cLa La Land\u201d cast and crew was likely mirrored by the disappointment of those involved with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d the night\u2019s second-most-nominated film. Despite six nominations, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d about a young black man growing up in Miami, received a lone trophy \u2014 albeit an important one: best drama. \u201cPlease, tell a friend, tell a friend, tell a friend,\u201d Barry Jenkins, the director of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d said in accepting the award, trying to boost the art film\u2019s box office performance. A year after Hollywood was excoriated for its lack of diversity at the Oscars, inclusion was a major theme on Sunday. \u201cThis is for all of the women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy,\u201d said Tracee Ellis Ross, as she accepted the best television actress Globe for her role in the ABC series \u201cblack-ish.\u201d \u201cI want you to know that I see you. We see you.\u201d Ms. Ross was the first black woman to win in the category since 1983, when Debbie Allen won for \u201cFame.\u201d There were several surprises. Isabelle Huppert took best actress in a drama for the French film \u201cElle,\u201d beating Natalie Portman, who was favored to win for \u201cJackie.\u201d (\u201cElle,\u201d a thriller about a businesswoman who tracks her rapist, also won best foreign film.) The foreign journalists who bestow the Globes are known for spreading their awards far and wide, but several films received nothing, including \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins,\u201d \u201cLion,\u201d \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d and \u201cHell or High Water.\u201d \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d despite five nominations, was honored only in the best actor category for Casey Affleck. HBO, despite 14 nominations, the most of any network, was shut out altogether. The first award of the night, for best supporting actor, dropped jaws: Aaron Taylor-Johnson won for his performance in Tom Ford\u2019s little-seen \u201cNocturnal Animals,\u201d beating favorites like Mahershala Ali of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d \u201cI made it \u2014 thank you,\u201d Mr. Taylor-Johnson said, looking a bit startled. To the surprise of almost no one, Viola Davis took the supporting actress prize for playing a 1950s homemaker in \u201cFences.\u201d After doling out two kisses, one to her husband and one to Denzel Washington, who directed \u201cFences\u201d and stars in it, Ms. Davis thanked its producers for taking a risk on the film. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t scream moneymaker,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it does scream art. It does scream heart.\u201d Early television awards were widely distributed. The slow-burning FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d about an aspiring rapper and his manager cousin, was honored as best comedy and Donald Glover won for best comedic actor for his performance in the show. Beating the likes of Rami Malek (\u201cMr. Robot\u201d) and Bob Odenkirk (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d) for best actor in a drama was Billy Bob Thornton, honored for his performance in \u201cGoliath,\u201d a show with little buzz. Best actress in a TV drama went to Claire Foy, who plays a young Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown,\u201d which won for best dramatic series. As expected, \u201cThe People vs. O. J. Simpson: Crime Story\u201d was named best mini-series, and Sarah Paulson, repeating her win at the Emmys, collected a trophy for her portrayal of the prosecutor Marcia Clark in that show. A misty-eyed Ms. Paulson was showered with hugs from A-listers as she returned to her seat. Jimmy Fallon keeps things light The night got off to a jerky start. After the host, Jimmy Fallon, opened the show with the taped \u201cLa La Land\u201d-themed number, he became befuddled after a teleprompter malfunction. Still, he kept it breezy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cLet\u2019s make tonight a celebration,\u201d Mr. Fallon said in hismonologue. Despite promises in preshow interviews to zing Donald J. Trump ahead of his inauguration, Mr. Fallon even kept his political jokes to a minimum. \u201cOne of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote,\u201d he said, almost in a mumble. For casual movie fans, the annual Oscar race starts with the Globes. (Oscar nomination ballots are due on Friday.) But the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the Globes, has worked in recent years to make its television honors more relevant by leaning toward rookie shows like \u201cThe Affair\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d Hollywood stylists spent most of the week fretting about the weather forecast. For days, it looked like torrential rain would threaten a repeat of the 2010 Globes ceremony, when the red carpet turned into a swamp. On Sunday, however, Angelenos awakened to \u201c another day of sun ,\u201d to borrow a lyric from \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Photo Meryl Streep Credit Paul Drinkwater/NBC Meryl Streep gets political in speech When Meryl Streep, a 30-time Globes nominee and eight-time winner, accepted her Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, she gave an impassioned speech that, while never mentioning Mr. Trump by name, was a clear reaction to the election. \u201cTake your broken heart, make it into art,\u201d she said, quoting Carrie Fisher. Mr. Trump, in a brief telephone interview , said that he had not watched the Globes or Ms. Streep\u2019s speech, but that he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d that she and some other entertainment figures had criticized him during the Hollywood event. \u201cMeryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep\u2019s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of Mrs. Clinton. While winners steered away from directly criticizing Mr. Trump, several used their moment onstage to take clear jabs. The British actor Hugh Laurie, collecting a best-supporting actor award for \u201cThe Night Manager,\u201d said: \u201cI can say I won this at the last-ever Golden Globes. I mean, it has the words \u2018Hollywood,\u2019 \u201cForeign\u2019 and \u2018Press\u2019 in it.\u201d He added, \u201cI also think to some Republicans, even the word \u2018Association\u2019 is sketchy.\u201d Some Trump supporters, either anticipating the barbs or irritated that many Hollywood stars have been outspoken in their horror at his election, made #BoycottGoldenGlobes trend on Twitter early on Sunday. Photo Ruth Negga Credit Jordan Strauss/Invision, via Associated Press An eye on the red carpet The Golden Globes are great fun, and so is its red carpet. Among this year\u2019s first arrivals were the Stallone sisters, this year\u2019s Miss Golden Globes, shepherded about by their father Sylvester\u2019s old-school, no-nonsense publicist; no buttering up of reporters. A news crew from Canada was promised a question with the sisters but then told \u201cThey need to go do Twitter\u201d first. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Issa Rae and Donald Glover were among the luminaries who admitted to feeling slightly intimidated to being there. Mr. Glover said he really wanted to meet Ms. Davis, and that he was still shocked at the huge response to \u201cAtlanta,\u201d his FX series. \u201cIt was supposed to be a punk show,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they screened it at A.F.I. and Scorsese was laughing.\u201d Ms. Rae, of the HBO show \u201cInsecure,\u201d said she was still adjusting to her growing fame. \u201cI\u2019m an introvert, I barely leave the house,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be out here is a blessing but I\u2019m like: \u2018Wow, guys. It\u2019s just me.\u201d Photo Claire Foy and Matt Smith in \u201cThe Crown.\u201d Credit Robert Viglasky/Netflix \u2018The Crown\u2019 makes Netflix a winner Even though Netflix has upended the TV industry, that streaming service had never won in the best drama or comedy category at the Globes (and the Emmys, for that matter). That changed this year with \u201cThe Crown,\u201d , which was named best drama. Claire Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth, won for best actress in a drama. \u201cThe Crown\u201d beat out \u201cStranger Things,\u201d also from Netflix; \u201cWestworld,\u201d the HBO series that practically requires a Ph.D. to understand it; NBC\u2019s feel-good \u201cThis Is Us\u201d; and HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Photo Winona Ryder in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d from Netflix. Credit Netflix Another closely watched television race was for best comedic actress, where Ms. Ross beat out some stiff competition to become the first black woman to win in the category since Debbie Allen in 1983. Also nominated were the four-time Globe winner Sarah Jessica Parker, for her role as a 40-something suburban mother in HBO\u2019s \u201cDivorce\u201d; Ms. Rae, nominated for her much-loved performance in HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d; Julia Louis-Dreyfus from the network\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d; and last year\u2019s winner, Rachel Bloom (\u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d). Still raucous after all these years Globe voters have ardently tried to leave behind their reputation for paying more attention to celebrity than honoring the year\u2019s best performances. Once upon a time, Globe attendees also bellied up to the open bar in a boozy spectacle, but nominees \u2014 heeding the scolding eyes of their publicists \u2014 have largely started sticking to water. Despite moments of seriousness, however, the Globes lived up its raucous reputation. The \u201cModern Family\u201d star Sofia Vergara made anus jokes from the stage. NBC censors bleeped expletives from Amy Schumer. Dinner guests in multiple instances chatted right through the speeches. As ever, the ballroom\u2019s smoking patio was chockablock with stars; at one moment, Sophie Turner from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d lit her cigarette off one held by her co-star Maisie Williams. The young \u201cStranger Things\u201d cast members ran around taking selfies. As ever, the ceremony\u2019s success will be determined by the Nielsen ratings. About 18.5 million people watched last year, down from 19.3 million in 2015. Televised award shows in general have been suffering from viewer erosion, partly because there is a seemingly endless array of them, but NBC had high hopes for Mr. Fallon. He has a much wider fan base than Mr. Gervais and has been using his \u201cTonight Show\u201d perch as a promotional platform for the gig. John Koblin and Patrick Healy contributed reporting.

According to the company\u2019s plan, the plant in Warren, Michigan will be made capable of producing a pickup truck currently built in Mexico.\u00a0 The Warren plant will make the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer large SUVs. A plant in Toledo, Ohio also will get new equipment to make a new Jeep pickup. The move by Fiat Chrysler follows a similar recent announcement made by a competing auto brand. On Tuesday, Ford said it would cancel a $1.6 billion plant planned for Mexico and instead invest $700 million in a Michigan assembly plant. Though CEO Mark Fields said the decision would have gone ahead whether or not Donald Trump was elected president, Fields also said Trump's \"pro-growth policies\" gave the company's executives confidence. The president-elect has taken many auto manufacturers to task for Mexican production and encouraged building more vehicles in the U.S. He tweeted at General Motors after the Ford announcement on Tuesday, threatening a \"big border tax\" for producing cars in Mexico and then selling them in the U.S. GM pushed back on that characterization of its business model. Sunday's announcement by Fiat Chrysler also follows news a day earlier that the company was recalling 100,000 mostly older trucks and SUVs to replace Takata air bag inflators. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Thomas Koehler/Photothek via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Thomas Koehler/Photothek via Getty Images Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, during a 2015 meeting with Germany's foreign minister in Tehran. Thomas Koehler/Photothek via Getty Images Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's fourth president and a towering figure in the country, has died at the age of 82, according to Iranian state media. For decades, the Shiite Muslim cleric played an outsize role in Iranian politics. An aide to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the country's 1979 revolution, Rafsanjani served on the Revolutionary Council that helped transform the newborn Islamic Republic from a monarchy into a theocracy. During the 1980s, Rafsjani boosted his public profile in weekly sermons to the country and helped guide Iran's military operations in a costly eight-year war with its neighbor Iraq. When Khomeini died in 1989, then-President Ali Khamenei was named his successor as supreme leader in Iran, and Rafsjani was elected president. He served in that role from 1989 to 1997, during which time he embarked on a program of economic reform and insisted on constitutional reforms that gave significantly more executive power to the office of the president. NPR's Peter Kenyon reports that Rafsanjani enjoyed a kind of renaissance as an influential reformer late in his political career. \"Rafsanjani tried to run for president again in 2005, but was defeated by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He made another attempt in 2013, but in a controversial move, Iran's guardian council disqualified him. \"Voters instead chose the candidate most aligned with Rafsanjani's pragmatic views, Hassan Rouhani. Many Iranians saw Rafsanjani as a mentor to Rouhani, and his influence rose.\" Article continues after sponsorship Rafsanjani played a crucial role as a bridge between moderates of modern Iranian politics and some of the hard-line politicians of the preceding generation. This was particularly true in the debate over diplomatic relations with the U.S. \"Rafsanjani was a man who was always anti-American, stuck to Iranian ideology, but at the same time was preaching that there should be relations with the United States \u2014 that there should be an update domestically of Iran's harsh ideological rules,\" Thomas Erdbrink, Tehran bureau chief for The New York Times, tells NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro. Erdbrink adds: \"He is and was a good friend of [Iranian Supreme Leader] Ayatollah Khamenei, but at the same time had the stature to criticize his and other policies. With him gone, it will be harder to voice certain criticisms.\" Just months from Iraq's presidential election in May, Rafsanjani's death also leaves President Rouhani without his \"political soul mate,\" in the words of The Washington Post . Rouhani, whose signature nuclear deal with the U.S. is already in danger, now faces an even more inclement political climate with Rafsjani gone. ",

The President also warned against letting partisan divides undermine U.S. intelligence. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, George, one of the things I am concerned about is the degree to which we\u2019ve seen a lot of commentary lately where there are Republicans or pundits or cable commentators who seem to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans are Democrats. That cannot be,\u201d Obama said. President Obama 'Heartbroken' for Victims' Families After Fort Lauderdale Shooting Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on U.S. intelligence on Russian hacking and today, even after being briefed on the matter, insisted any cyberattack had \"absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\" The president warned of the threat to future elections if the United States doesn\u2019t address the issue of cybersecurity. \u201cYou have I think the clear example of how, if we're not vigilant, foreign countries can have an impact on the political debate in the United States in ways that might not have been true 10, 20, 30 years ago, in part because of the way news is transmitted and in part because so many people are skeptical of mainstream news organizations that everything's true and everything's false. You know, nothing is settled. Everything is contested,\u201d the president said. Obama said he had an additional piece of advice for the president-elect. \u201cOne of the things that I've urged the president-elect to do is to develop a strong working relationship with the intelligence community,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI think it's important that Congress, on a bipartisan basis, work with the next administration, looking forward to make sure that this kind of influence is minimized.\u201d \u201cWe have to remind ourselves we\u2019re on the same team. Vladimir Putin\u2019s not on our team,\" Obama added. Asked by Stephanopoulos if he underestimated Putin, Obama said he doesn't think he did. \"I don't think I underestimated him, but I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation, for cyberhacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating,\" he said. \"There are going to be elections coming up among our NATO allies that we have to pay attention to,\" the president said. \"I anticipate that this kind of thing can happen again here. And so in addition to the report assessing what exactly happened, what we have also done is to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security and our intelligence teams are working with the various folks who run our elections.\" 0 Shares ",

The slight change of tune comes after an increasing number of Republicans lawmakers have voiced their concern about the consequences of repealing Obamacare without a plan to replace it. According to one nonpartisan study, repealing the ACA would cause nearly 30 million people to lose their health care , a number that would jump to 59 million by 2019. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, is the latest lawmaker to speak up, telling NBC News that it is \"unwise\" for Republicans to move forward on repeal without a replacement plan ready to go. \"I believe it is a fair statement to say that there is a diverse cross-section of the House Republican Conference who feel, as I did, that replacement should occur simultaneously of a repeal,\" Dent said in a telephone interview. Dent said it is \"careless\" to simply \"hope for the best\" after a repeal. Related: Tough Choices Loom on Long Road to Replacing Obamacare Dent, a moderate Republican, is not alone in his concern. Members of the conservative Freedom Caucus are also urging a quick replacement. They met with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, this week to discuss the repeal strategy. Paul was one of the first senators to express dissatisfaction with the initial plans to repeal the health care law without a replacement. He wrote an opinion piece urging that \"repeal and replace\" should be simultaneous, and he tweeted that he spoke to President-elect Donald Trump, who agreed. I just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 7, 2017 On Friday, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, an ally of Trump's, said on NBC's \"MTP Daily,\" \"I don't think we can just repeal Obamacare and say we're going to get the answer two years from now.\" Hours later, another Republican echoed him, saying the strategy to repeal, then replace is not wise. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, told reporters Friday: \"I think the president-elect's position was the right position, and again, if you look at some of his quotes recently, he continues to offer caution as it relates to this, that in fact in the campaign he said repeal and replace should take place simultaneously. That to me is the prudent course of action.\" McConnell, R-Kentucky, seems to be digesting his members' concerns. In December, he indicated that replacement could take time, saying that after repeal is complete, \"what comes next is what comes next. Then we will determine what the replacement is going to be.\" But Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\"McConnell said Republicans \"will be replacing it rapidly after repealing it.\" When pressed on a timeline, McConnell refused to provide specifics, saying only that it would be \"very quickly.\" Play ",

    "text": "Democrats, Top Ethics Official Urge GOP to Slow Down Confirmation Process By BENJAMIN SIEGEL WASHINGTON, D.C. \u0097 Jan 8, 2017, 6:50 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump's Transition Team Gears up for Senate Confirmation Hearings 0 Shares Email Democrats and the government ethics office are raising concerns about several nominees who haven't completed the standard ethics review process, as at least eight of Donald Trump 's Cabinet nominees prepare for confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill this week. \"The announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me,\" Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub said in a letter to top senators released by Sens. Elizabeth Warren , D-Massachusetts, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-New York. \"This schedule has created undue pressure on OGE's staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews.\" Shaub added that the delay has left some of the nominees with \"potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues.\" \"I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process,\" he said. According to a Senate Democratic aide, Gen. John Kelly, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security , education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos, treasury secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, and Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary nominee Ben Carson have not completed the OGE's review process. A Trump transition official said Kelly's ethics paperwork is complete, and that OGE is transmitting it to the Senate on Monday, while a GOP Senate Judiciary Committee aide says the panel has received all preliminary documents and paperwork from Sen. Jeff Sessions ahead of his hearing. Ten of President Obama\u2019s Cabinet picks were confirmed within the week of his inauguration , while three of his Cabinet selections were pulled from consideration. The Senate held confirmation hearings for four of his nominees on a single day in January 2009, before Obama's inauguration. Republicans have also argued that nominees from previous administrations sat for confirmation hearings before all of their forms had been submitted to the panels of jurisdiction, including Bush administration nominees Roderick Page, for education secretary, and Elaine Chao, nominated for labor secretary, in 2001. According to a HELP committee aide, the committee received Paige's paperwork eight days after the hearing, and Chao's five days after the hearing. The aide also said DeVos's paperwork is still in progress, but that committee precedent requires it to be ready before a vote on her nomination, and not the hearing. Democrats claim Republicans are ramming nominees through the confirmation process too quickly. Republicans have scheduled five confirmation hearings for Wednesday, the same day Trump is scheduled to give his first news conference since being elected president. They are pointing to a 2009 letter from Sen. Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky, to then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada, urging him to postpone confirmation hearings until OGE letters were completed and submitted to the committees of jurisdiction. The Senate is also going to have a marathon floor session on the budget this week, adding to the packed schedule. Kelly is scheduled to appear before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday, while the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is planning a hearing for DeVos on Wednesday. Carson is scheduled to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, and Ross will appear before the Senate Commerce Committee on the same day. The Trump transition team accused Democrats of politicizing the transition process. \"President-elect Trump is putting together the most qualified administration in history and the transition process is currently running smoothly. In the midst of a historic election where Americans voted to drain the swamp, it is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country,\" a transition official said in a statement. \"This is a disservice to the country and is exactly why voters chose Donald J. Trump as their next president.\" In an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, McConnell said the Senate confirmed seven of President Obama's Cabinet appointments on Inauguration Day in 2009, and said Democrats need to \"grow up\" and \"get past\" the election results. \"The real thing is the vote on the floor, and we want to have all of the records in, all of the papers completed before they are actually confirmed on the Senate floor,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

(Bucks County Prosecutor's Office) A Pennsylvania mother and her boyfriend acted out a \"rape-murder fantasy\" when they killed the woman's 14-year-old daughter in July, prosecutors said Sunday. Sara Packer, 41, and Jacob Sullivan, 44, planned Grace Packer\u2019s murder for more than a year, killed her in July, and then stored the body in the attic of their rented home in Quakertown for nearly four months and later cut it up, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported, citing a court affidavit charging Sullivan with the gruesome crime. The court papers say that before the killing Sullivan raped Grace while her mother watched, according to the paper. The affidavit also states that the body was preserved in the attic in kitty litter. \u201cThis was a sexual fantasy that was shared between Jacob Sullivan and Sara Packer, and Grace Packer was the object of that rape-murder fantasy,\u201d the paper quoted Bucks County Prosecutor Matthew Weintraub as saying. Sullivan appeared before a judge early Sunday on charges of homicide, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, unlawful restraint, kidnapping, possessing instruments of crime, endangering the welfare of a child, abuse of corpse, simple assault, tampering with physical evidence, and corresponding conspiracy charges. He was jailed without bail. Sara Packer was arrested hours later in Horsham Township on charges of homicide, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, possessing instruments of crime, endangering the welfare of a child, abuse of corpse, simple assault, tampering with physical evidence, and conspiracy to commit rape. Her arraignment was pending. They each could face the death penalty. Investigators said Sara Packer reported her daughter missing July 11. Hunters found the girl\u2019s dismembered remains in the woods on Halloween. Fox 29 Philadelphia reported in December that Packer had been accused of hindering the search for her daughter by withholding information and secretly moving to another town. The station also reported that Packer had pocketed $3,600 in disability benefits for her daughter after the disappearance. The affidavit says staff at a hospital called investigators Saturday to report that Sullivan had confessed to the girl\u2019s killing, WFMZ-TV reported. Sullivan and Packer had been hospitalized Dec. 30 after trying to kill themselves with pills. Weintraub said that under subsequent questioning by Bucks County detectives, Sullivan revealed in detail how the girl was assaulted and killed over the course of about 18 hours, beginning July 8. The affidavit states that after the rape, Grace was bound, gagged and left to die in a closet in the attic that Sullivan told investigators was \u201cextremely hot,\u201d the station reported. When she didn\u2019t die as expected, Sullivan then wrapped his arm around her neck and face, squeezing the life out of her, according to the affidavit. Sullivan told detectives that Grace\u2019s body was cut up in a bathtub after cops paid them a visit in October and then discarded in the woods. Two weeks before Grace\u2019s body was found her mother was captured on video buying a bow saw and two extra blades at a tractor supply store, the affidavit states. Advertisement ",

Watch our interview with @KellyannePolls : Russia \"did not succeed\" in attempts to sway election https://t.co/EZhgUIUbYx #MTP pic.twitter.com/KWK6vwlVY5 \u2014 Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) January 8, 2017 Conway, who served as Trump's campaign manager before being chosen as his top adviser, appeared on Meet the Press on Sunday morning to discuss Russia's attempt to interfere with the U.S. presidential campaign by hacking the Democratic National Committee and other political groups.The U.S. intelligence community issued a report Friday concluding that Russians were trying to help Trump and hurt Democrat Hillary Clinton. Asked if Trump accepts the report's conclusion Conway said, \"Look, we don't want any foreign government to interfere in the U.S.\" \"This man, Donald Trump, ran successfully on America first and he means it in every respect of the term,\" she said. \"In terms of Russia...they did not succeed in throwing the election to Donald Trump. That's very clear in this report...There is no evidence that Russia succeeded in any alleged attempt to disrupt our democracy or in fact to influence the election results.\" Conway clashed with Todd when she went on to claim that \"respectfully, many in the mainstream media also tried to attempt to influence our election results for Hillary Clinton.\" Todd responded: \"Wait a minute, let's not conflate here the crutch of always trying to attack the media.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2i7myiP Most Popular ",

    "text": "CBS News January 8, 2017, 10:12 AM An old horse and his friend A very old horse is Still Kickin\u2019 -- thanks to one very devoted friend. Tony Dokoupil has their story: \u201cMorning, kids!\u201d When Donnie MacAdams wakes up to feed the horses, there\u2019s one in particular that gets special attention. Waco Hanover in his harness racing days. Everett Kettler \u201cWaco! How ya doing? Want your grain?\u201d he yells out. Waco Hanover is a retired harness racer, living out his days on a farm in the Green Mountains of Vermont. Waco was never able to outrun most horses, but he\u2019s certainly managed to outlive them. This month Waco is celebrating a very rare birthday, for a horse: The big 4-0 -- that\u2019s about 120 in people years. Under an old rule of horseracing, January 1st is considered the universal birthday of runners. Since the life expectancy for a horse is about 25 years, he\u2019s one old horse. Donnie MacAdams is a big part of Waco\u2019s longevity. Living in an apartment above the barn, he\u2019s not only caretaker but kind of a roommate. But mostly, he\u2019s Waco\u2019s best friend. \u201cWatch the ice. Slow down, will ya?\u201d MacAdams manages a state information center just off Interstate 89. But for the past eight years his downtime has been utterly devoted to Waco.\u00a0 Waco and Donnie. Barbara Livingston It\u2019s not a warm and cuddly friendship, because MacAdams is not a warm and cuddly guy. \u201cNo talking?\u201d he admonishes Waco.\u00a0 And as luck would have it, neither is Waco. \u201cHe\u2019s a cranky old SOB,\u201d MacAdams said, \u201cjust like I am.\u201d But don\u2019t be fooled by their tough guy act. For fun? They eat animal crackers.\u00a0 A healthy appetite is relatively new for Waco. When MacAdams moved in, back in 2008, the horse was barely eating at all. \u201cI wanted to dig a hole, because I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d make it through the winter,\u201d he said. Amy Wall But as it turned out, Waco wasn\u2019t sick. He was lonely. MacAdams recalled, \u201cI just talked to him one day for about a half an hour, and got him to accept the fact that I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere, I\u2019m your buddy. It\u2019s been going on now for eight years.\u201d MacAdams\u2019 work at the information center has him dealing with people -- not exactly his thing. But at the end of the day, Waco is there. \u201cThere were times in the wintertime when I\u2019d walk into the barn, walk down there, just lean on the stall front. He would put his head on my shoulder and just chew, just chew, and just calm me down.\u201d Even after a heart attack, when MacAdams felt like he\u2019d never recover (\u201cI couldn\u2019t carry a five-gallon bucket of water, because it was too physically stressful\u201d), Waco was there. (\u201cNow, two five pound pails, let\u2019s go!\u201d) DoKoupil asked, \u201cDo you think about what would happen to him if something happened to you?\u201d \u201cOh yeah, yeah,\u201d MacAdams said. \u201cI think that\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m still around, honestly!\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ",

    "text": "4 Killed, at Least a Dozen Wounded In Jerusalem Truck Attack, Officials Say By Michael Edison Hayden Jan 8, 2017, 1:52 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Israeli Soldiers Run Down by Truck in Suspected Terror Attack 0 Shares Email Four people were killed and more than a dozen wounded in West Jerusalem today when a truck ran over a group of Israeli soldiers, authorities said. The Israeli police are calling the incident a terror attack. The driver of the vehicle, whom police said was a resident of East Jerusalem, was shot dead at the scene. The soldiers targeted by the assailant were on an educational trip along with several other groups, according to the Israeli paper Haaretz. AHMAD GHARABLI/AFP/Getty Images Israeli security forces gather around a flatbed truck at the site of a ramming attack in Jerusalem, Jan. 8, 2017. The mayhem occurred when the truck appeared to veer off course and barreled into the soldiers, who had just gotten off a bus, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. Security footage appeared to show the truck moving at high speed and the soldiers located well off the road at the time they were struck, according to The Associated Press. The AP also reported that the footage showed vehicle appearing to back up, running over more people as it did. The source of the footage was not immediately clear, the AP said. An instructor who was escorting the soldiers on the trip told Israeli media that he shot and killed the truck driver before anyone else was hurt. Other soldiers also opened fire, he said. MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP/Getty Images An Israeli soldier is consoled as she cries at the site of a vehicle-ramming attack in Jerusalem, Jan. 8, 2017. Trucks have been used as weapons in several high-profile terrorist attacks in recent years, including the Bastille Day attack in Nice, France, last July that killed over 80 people, and the Christmas market attack in Berlin, Germany, that killed a dozen people in late December. MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP/Getty Images Israeli security forces and emergency personnel gather at the site of a vehicle-ramming attack in Jerusalem, Jan. 8, 2017. According to the AP, since last year, Palestinian attackers have killed 36 Israelis and two visiting Americans in a series of mostly stabbing attacks. During that time, 229 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire. Israel says most of the Palestinians killed were attackers while the rest died in clashes. Israel says the violence is driven by Palestinian incitement. Palestinians say it's the result of nearly 50 years of Israeli occupation. Mark Toner, a deputy spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, issued a statement on today's truck attack. \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms today's horrific vehicular attack by a terrorist in Jerusalem. There is absolutely no justification for these brutal and senseless attacks,\" the statement said. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the four Israeli soldiers who were killed, and we hope for a full and fast recovery of those injured.\" ABC News' Molly Hunter and The Associated Press contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

In a statement, prosecutors said special forces arrested the suspect, who was transported to the Mexican attorney general's office. The suspect was not immediately identified, and details about a possible motive were not released. Surveillance video captured images of the suspect Friday in Guadalajara, Mexico. Facebook - consulate in Guadalajara The victim, who also was not identified, was recovering from what Secretary of State John Kerry called a \"heinous attack\" in a statement Sunday. The officer was shot Friday in Guadalajara. Later that day, the U.S. consulate released a video of the shooting that showed a man in dark blue shirt and pants waiting near a security gate. As a black car pulls up to the gate \u2014 and with someone sitting on a planter just feet away \u2014 the man points a gun at the windshield and fires. Then he turns and runs. In a statement on its Facebook page, the consulate said the FBI was offering $20,000 for information that could help identify the suspect. It was unclear whether someone would be eligible for that reward. Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city, is an economic powerhouse in a region wracked by violence. In 2015, a powerful cartel killed 25 police officers in two months, shot down a military helicopter and \"shut the state of Jalisco down\" with 40 road blocks, a U.S. State Department report said.

    "text": "Steven was born and raised in Miami, attended college in Israel, and became a freelance journalist, reporting from war zones where information was scarce, like Yemen, Benghazi, Libya and Syria where he went in the summer of 2013.\u00a0 Just before he crossed into Aleppo, he called his dad. \u00a0 \u00a0 Art Sotloff: He contacted me and told me not to worry, and, but if I don\u2019t hear from him within four days, that I should get in touch with one of his colleagues. Lesley Stahl: Oh, that\u2019s ominous. He didn\u2019t hear from his son. Not just for four days. It was four excruciating months. Then, finally they got a ransom letter with demands for the government to free all the Muslims in U.S. custody. Luke Somers in Sanaa, Yemen, July 2013. Close AP Note to readers: In reporting our story on Steven Sotloff, we spoke with, among others, the family of American photojournalist Luke Somers. Just a month after Sotloff was captured by ISIS in Syria in 2013, Somers was seized in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Like Sotloff,\u00a0 Somers tragically died in late 2014 while in captivity . Along with a South African teacher, Somers was shot by his captors during a Navy SEAL rescue attempt. Shirley Sotloff: \u201cThen there is a last option. \u20ac100 million will secure Steven\u2019s release.\u201d Lesley Stahl: --which is something like 100-- Art Sotloff: $137 million. Lesley Stahl: What was your reaction? Shirley Sotloff: Reaction was how the hell are we going to get this money together? They thought the U.S. government would help them, but they were bewildered and then infuriated when they say they met a stone wall, the U.S. policy forbidding the paying of ransom.\u00a0 Lisa Monaco: It\u2019s some of the hardest work that I\u2019ve done. Lisa Monaco, assistant to President Obama for counterterrorism, oversaw the hostage crisis. Lisa Monaco: These are horrible choices. On the one hand, if you don\u2019t pay a ransom, you are putting an innocent life at risk. On the other hand, if you do, you\u2019re fueling the very activity that\u2019s put them at risk in the first place. Lesley Stahl: Did you feel ever that the policy might be wrong? Lisa Monaco: The policy that\u2019s been a decades-old policy of not paying ransom, I think is the right policy. Lesley Stahl: So you didn\u2019t question that.\u00a0 Lisa Monaco: We didn\u2019t. We believed that that was important to maintain. But with the exception of the UK, most European countries do pay ransom -- without publicly admitting it. Steven was held with 22 other hostages, including the three Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller, who were all killed. Once the European governments paid ransom, ISIS released their citizens, one of whom smuggled out this letter from Steven. Steven Sotloff\u2019s letter to his family Close CBS News Art Sotloff: He was speaking how he can\u2019t stand seeing all the captives leave from all different countries. How could the United States just stand by and not do anything?\u00a0 As the European hostages came out and spoke of mock executions and waterboardings, the Sotloffs decided they would try to raise at least some of the money themselves. But then they and the other U.S. families attended a meeting in Washington with officials on the National Security Council. To learn about where to receive support for hostage victims and their families, visit\u00a0 Hostage US , an independent nonprofit that offers guidance during and after a kidnapping. Art Sotloff: All of us were saying, \u201cWell, why can\u2019t we try to save our kids?\u00a0 And they said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s against the law. We do not negotiate with terrorists.\u201d Lesley Stahl: Did they say you would be prosecuted? Art Sotloff: They said, \u201cYou could be prosecuted, and also your donors could be prosecuted.\u201d Lesley Stahl: So if I gave you money, I could be prosecuted? Shirley Sotloff: Yes-- Lesley Stahl: Did anybody say, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Art Sotloff: Yes, they did. Yes, they did. Lesley Stahl: So it was a little bit contentious. Art Sotloff: Oh yeah. We kind of verbally fought back. Lesley Stahl: They were threatened that they could be prosecuted. Is that true? Lisa Monaco: So what\u2019s true is that some families felt threatened. And that was unacceptable. And that should never have happened. Lesley Stahl: Are you suggesting they may not have been threatened? Lisa Monaco: No. What I\u2019m suggesting is, I wasn\u2019t present when any threats were made, but what matters, Lesley, is that these families felt that way as they were going through the most horrific time they will ever encounter. Lesley Stahl: But was that the policy?\u00a0 Was that true?\u00a0 Could they have actually been prosecuted?\u00a0 Could someone who contributed to pay ransom also be prosecuted? Lisa Monaco: So what\u2019s true is that the Justice Department has never prosecuted a family or friends of a family that has paid a ransom. Lesley Stahl: But was it the policy? Lisa Monaco: Well, what\u2019s, the, the policy is the United States Government will not pay ransoms or make concessions to terrorist hostage takers. That policy is based in part on a presumption that paying ransom invites more hostage taking. But that is refuted by a new study that examined the case of every known Western hostage taken since 911. It was co-authored by Peter Bergen, a counterterrorism expert, for the non-partisan New America Foundation. Peter Bergen: They don\u2019t know necessarily you\u2019re American when they take you. It\u2019s sort of a target of opportunity. So some countries are known to pay ransom \u2013 the French, the Germans, the Spanish. Lesley Stahl: Even though, they don\u2019t admit it. Peter Bergen: They don\u2019t admit it, but they do. Their citizens have much better outcomes than Americans.\u00a0 Americans are huge outliers here. You\u2019re twice as likely to have a negative outcome compared to every other Western hostage. Lesley Stahl: You say negative outcome. You mean murdered. Peter Bergen: Murdered, die in captivity or just remain in captivity. Fourteen of the European hostages held with Steven made it home. Those from countries that don\u2019t pay ransom didn\u2019t: four Americans and two Brits died. Lesley Stahl: I keep playing in my own head this horrible situation where the American hostages watched the other ones be set free. And I wonder if it wouldn\u2019t have been better if, if our government did what the European governments did, which was pay ransom but then deny it in order to save their citizens. Why couldn\u2019t we have done that? Lisa Monaco: We\u2019d still be fueling their terror activity. Whether it\u2019s hostage taking or whether it\u2019s terrorist plots, to kill Americans here in the homeland or elsewhere, is not activity that the United States government should be in the business of funding. Lesley Stahl: What do you say to critics of the policy of not paying ransom? That the beheadings of the Americans ended up having more value to ISIS than any money would have been. That\u2019s really what put them on the international map. These beheading videos were a gold mine for ISIS. Do you, do you see it that way? Lisa Monaco: I don\u2019t. And-- I think it\u2019s giving brutal, murderous thugs too much credit. Lesley Stahl: What about the argument that if you pay ransom you\u2019re just encouraging them to kidnap more? But also that the money is going to go toward terrorism. And so what\u2019s the come back to that? It\u2019s a hard thing. Art Sotloff: Going back to what President Obama said to us in person that he would do anything in his power to save his children if he was in the same situation. And I say that he should put himself in the same situation. And I think that the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens in whatever way that they can. Lesley Stahl: What do you say when you hear people argue that Steven knew he was putting his life at risk by going into Syria at that point and, you know, kinda the burden\u2019s on him? Art Sotloff: Steven was driven by truth. That he had to report the truth. He saw that there wasn\u2019t information coming out of these areas. And that\u2019s really what drove him. In the summer of 2014, nearly a year after Steven was abducted, President Obama ordered a military operation to rescue the hostages. Lisa Monaco: This involved a number of, a large number of military service members and special operators who\u2014 Lesley Stahl: Putting their lives on the line. Lisa Monaco: Putting their lives on the line. Going into the heart of ISIL territory in Syria. And as we were monitoring the operation, word came back, some very devastating words: \u201cIt\u2019s a dry hole,\u201d which meant that they weren\u2019t there. [Jihadi John: This is James Wright Foley.] About seven weeks later, James Foley became the first of three American hostages beheaded. Steven appears at the end of the video. [Jihadi John points knife at camera: The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.] The Sotloffs then received an audio message that sounds like Steven was forced to record, designed to pressure the U.S. government.\u00a0 It was given to them by the FBI. Surviving the death of a child Art Sotloff: This is always tough for me, because it\u2019s actually his voice. And it just makes me feel like he\u2019s still in the room with us. \u201cTo Mom, I do not have much time and will probably not get this opportunity again so I would like to get straight to the point. My life depends on Obama\u2019s next decision. Mom, please don\u2019t let Obama kill me. Mom you can still save my life just like the families of my previous cellmates whom I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve met. Fight for me, I love you.\u201d Shirley Sotloff: Powerful. Art Sotloff: I gotta blow my nose. I\u2019m sorry. If I could excuse myself. Lesley Stahl: It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s cruel. Shirley Sotloff: Very. I don\u2019t know what they wanted us to do. Lesley Stahl: And always saying \u201cmom\u201d like that. Shirley Sotloff: Mom. ",

Because of course it does -- and because those last-minute arrivals from the red carpet managed to miss the sit-down dinner. But Sly Stallone was all about the pralines. And the truffle pops? They\u00a0are so people don't get their fancy clothes dirty.

(Jordan Strauss / Invision / Associated Presss) While women's suiting was expected to play a major role at the Golden Globes this year -- and there were a few suits spotted on the red carpet (Olivia Spencer, Evan Rachel Wood and Kathryn Hahn , to name a few), the major fashion trends of this awards show were captured through feminine styles and forms including liquid metal, 3-D appliqu\u00e9 and A-line skirts. Stay tuned for our best and worst dressed photo gallery and Times Deputy Fashion Editor Adam Tschorn's recap of the big styles on red carpet at the Golden Globes. Jessica Biel , left, Carrie Underwood and Olivia Culpo. (Getty Images; Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) Film TV Jan. 8, 2017, 5:07 p.m. 'This Is Us' Mandy Moore didn't choreograph 'La La Land'; that's a different Mandy Moore Libby Hill Mandy Moore is nominated for her work on NBC's \"This Is Us.\" She is not the other Mandy Moore. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Thanks to the elaborate dance number opening\u00a0tonight's Golden Globes, the ceremony will feature the work of more Mandy Moores than you can shake a stick at. Which is to say, two. Jimmy Fallon's elaborate song and dance number was choreographed by one Moore, while another Moore is waiting in the wings to present. You may remember the Mandy Moore pictured above from her first career as a pop music star in the late '90s/early aughts. Her first album, \"So Real,\" went platinum, and she's sold over 10 million albums worldwide. Since first breaking onto the scene, Moore has transitioned from singing to acting, voicing the lead character in Disney's \"Tangled\" and appearing opposite Anne Hathaway in \"The Princess Diaries.\" In 2016, Moore returned to prominence with her emotional role on NBC's time-jumping family drama \"This Is Us.\" She's nominated tonight for supporting actress in a series, miniseries, or motion picture for TV. Mandy Moore choreographed \"La La Land.\" She is not the other Mandy Moore. (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times) This Mandy Moore played an integral role in the creation of awards season favorite \"La La Land,\" choreographing the film, including its show-stopping opening number. Choreographer Moore is Emmy-nominated for her work on Fox's \"So You Think You Can Dance\" and is helping to choreograph this evening's ceremony. There is, however, only one Tom Ford. Jan. 8, 2017, 5:10 p.m. 'This Is Us' could be the first network TV show to win the drama series Golden Globe in over 10 years Tracy Brown Milo Ventimiglia as Jack, second from left, and Mandy Moore as Rebecca in \"This Is Us.\" (Ron Batzdorff / NBC) NBC\u2019s freshman hit \"This Is Us\" notched three Golden Globe nominations going into tonight\u2019s awards, including in the coveted drama series category, and is among the top nominated drama shows this year. The series, which jumps between the past and present following family members who share the same birthday, is the only network TV show in a field that includes premium cable favorites \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Westworld,\" as well as streaming hits \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Crown.\" 2016 winner \"Mr. Robot\" is not even in contention this year. In fact, besides \"Game of Thrones,\" all of the shows are first-time nominees. But a win for \"This Is Us\" would be more than just a win for the show or NBC. It would mark the first time the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. recognized a network TV drama in more than a decade. The last time a network TV show won the Golden Globe for drama series was in 2006. The winner was \"Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\" which beat out \"24,\" \"Big Love,\" \"Heroes\" and \"Lost.\" The 2006 awards was also the last time network TV shows outnumbered cable or streaming shows among the drama series nominees. That said, the Golden Globes have continued to recognize network TV shows in the musical or comedy series category. While \"black-ish\" is the sole network show in the running in 2017, \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019s\" surprise win was just in 2013. Granted, the last two comedy series awards have gone to streaming shows: \"Mozart in the Jungle\" and \"Transparent.\" Jan. 8, 2017, 5:00 p.m. The award for nicest actor on the red carpet goes to.... Dev Patel Jen Yamato The red carpet at the Golden Globes is hardly known for its niceties -- except when Dev Patel is involved. The \"Lion\" star and\u00a0supporting actor drama nominee graciously thanked photographers with a smile Sunday evening, breaking with the dog-eat-dog atmosphere of your typical awards show arrival. In the jam-packed scrum\u00a0where\u00a0photographer\u00a0and fans vie for for quick snaps of stars\u00a0on their way down the\u00a0gauntlet, Patel\u00a0was the only celeb who took the time to return the appreciation rather than ambling along, guided by the iron hand of a publicist. Jan. 8, 2017, 4:57 p.m. How many times will Jimmy Fallon break down laughing during the show? Tracy Brown Jimmy Fallon is known for a number of things: \"The Tonight Show,\" \"Saturday Night Live\" and his tendency to break character during his performance. With that in mind, there are a couple of things fans can likely expect from tonight\u2019s Golden Globes telecast, which Fallon will host: no Ricky Gervais-style roasts or controversial comments; a musical skit;\u00a0and Fallon breaking character some point during the night. How many times do\u00a0you think Fallon will break down laughing during the Golden Globes? Fashion Film Red carpet Jan. 8, 2017, 4:55 p.m. The puppet star of 'My Life as a Zucchini' was on the red carpet, in a puppet tux Courgette, the lead character in animated feature nominee\u00a0\"My Life as a Zucchini,\" literally turned his frown upside down on the Golden Globes red carpet Sunday -- with a little help from director Claude Barras. \"Like that, we can change the emotions,\" Barras said after flipping his plus-one's mouth over and adjusting the little guy's eyes. Voila, Courgette went from sad to sassy. We're guessing Gaspard\u00a0Schlatter, the actor who gave him his voice in the film, had to employ a slightly deeper method. Red carpet Jan. 8, 2017, 4:45 p.m. 'Moonlight' has director Barry Jenkins optimistic I see this film's reception as optimism. I see it as a sign that we should tell the truth, our stories, more often and more consistently. They say black films don't travel but look at this.

A Golden Globes primer Given this year's television nominees, there's every chance that tonight's red carpet will be overrun with an inordinate number of children. Here's a guide to help you keep track of which kids belong where. \"Stranger Things\" Caleb McLaughlin, left,  Noah Schnapp, Millie Brown and Gaten Matarazzo from Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\" (Eric Charbonneau/Invision for Netflix/AP Images) Netflix's throwback to classic '80s films delighted fans and the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. alike. The show is nominated for television series, drama, so don't be surprised to see some of its child stars in their Sunday best. \"black-ish\" Marcus Scribner, left, Miles Brown, Marsai Martin, Yara Shahidi from ABC 's \"black-ish.\" (ABC/Tony Rivetti) Now in its third season on ABC, hit series \"black-ish\" has scored its first Golden Globes nominations, including nods for Anthony Anderson, Tracee Ellis Ross and the show itself. That the young stars of the show would appear at the ceremony to celebrate seems like a sure thing. \"This Is Us\" Mandy Moore, left, Mackenzie Hancsicsak, Milo Ventimiglia, Parker Bates and Lonnie Chavis in NBC's \"This Is Us.\" (Ron Batzdorff/NBC) NBC's heartwarming freshman drama, which shows characters both in the present and in the past,\u00a0was honored by the HFPA with nominations for supporting actress candidates Mandy Moore and Chrissy Metz, along with a nomination for the series for television series, drama. Though they play less prominent roles than the other young actors on this list, it's entirely possible that the show's child stars will make an appearance at Sunday's ceremony. Poll TV Jan. 8, 2017, 4:31 p.m. What awkward game will Jimmy Fallon have guests play at the Golden Globes? Tracy Brown Fans of \"The Tonight Show\" know that Jimmy Fallon has an endless vault of recurring games he likes to play with his celebrity guests. While hosting the Golden Globes may not be exactly the same as hosting a late-night show, it\u2019s hard to imagine the night not drawing on Fallon\u2019s brand of nice, fun-and-games entertainment. Will Fallon slow-jam his monologue? Probably not, but it\u2019s safe to say that it will be a stark contrast to what Golden Globes viewers have experienced during the years Ricky Gervais served as the host. The Golden Globes are most definitely not a dry affair, so perhaps Fallon will fall back on some classic drinking games like giant beer pong or\u00a0flip cup. What game do you think Fallon will have guests play at the Golden Globes? Jan. 8, 2017, 4:29 p.m. 'Loving' stars Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga continue their reign as fashion blockbusters on the red carpet \"Loving\" co-stars Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton attend the Golden Globes together. They were onscreen favorites portraying Richard and Mildred Loving in last year's bio pic \"Loving.\" And in real life, Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga have been quite fashionable in recent public appearances. With their Golden Globes looks tonight, the first-time nominees are clearly rising fashion stars. (After all, did you see them at the recent Palm Springs Film Festival?) For the Golden Globes, Negga wore a custom futuristic, shiny frock from Louis Vuitton, while Edgerton opted for a Brunello Cucinelli tuxedo with a vest. Jan. 8, 2017, 4:26 p.m. At the Golden Globes, even the Champagne guy is an actor Amy Kaufman (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times) This is Chris, 35, from Arizona. He got this gig through a buddy in his acting class \u2014 yep, he's trying to be an actor \u2014\u00a0who thought he might work well on the red carpet. \"I'm pretty calm under pressure,\" he said. He was hoping to hand out a bottle to Amy Adams, but so far his biggest \"get\" was Bernadette Peters. (Nida, who was handing out water near Chris, said the talent was taking bottles from her tray while while everyone else was grabbing Champagne.) (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times) ",

USA TODAY The House of Marley's Stir It Up turntable becomes available in the U.S. over the next two months. \u00a0(Photo: Jeremy Haik, House of Marley) LAS VEGAS -- Want to join -- or rejoin -- the vinyl movement? A wave of new turntables were on display at the Consumer Electronics Show here, all part of the resurgent interest in long-playing records. Various spins on the record player --\u00a0starting from under $100 to more than $15,000 -- could be found at the four-day technology trade show, which ended Sunday. The growing number of models reflects consumers' burgeoning affection for the seven decade-old format, which Nielsen says has seen sales rise for 10 straight years. Nostalgia for the format is what is driving some to give vinyl LPs another spin. But young music lovers, too, who grew up in the CD era are embracing records, too. 2017 International Consumer Electronics Show \"It\u2019s the warmth and even the noise, crackle, pop and hiss that have been filtered out of all the digital and streaming music. And it\u2019s that opening up a beautiful album of art to look at and read while you are listening and having to be actively involved with flipping the album over,\" said Josh Poulsen, director of product development, House of Marley , which is bringing its first turntable, the Stir It Up ($199), to market in the U.S. in the next two months.

It also has a USB output\u00a0so that albums can be converted into digital files, too. Elsewhere, the Crosley Radio booth had dozens of turntable models -- everything from an $89.95 Cruiser Deluxe portable player to a $12,000\u00a0jukebox that plays vinyl singles. The Crosley Radio booth at CES had a variety of turntables on display. \u00a0(Photo: Mike Snider, USA TODAY) Audio Technica USA's lineup includes the\u00a0$279\u00a0 AT-LP3 fully automatic belt-drive turntable coming this spring. The electronics company has expanded its lineup beyond models aimed at disc jockeys. \"Kids have discovered these big CDs up in the attic that belong to Mom and Dad,\" said the company's director of educational services Steve Savanyu.\u00a0 Audio Technica USA's booth at that 2017 CES sported multiple turntables. \u00a0(Photo: Mike Snider, USA TODAY) High-end turntables never went away, but some new ones are on the way to capitalize on the recent vinyl resurgence among well-heeled music aficionados. Technics, a favorite brand of DJs for years, displayed a new Grand Class audiophile turntable , expected to sell for about $2,000.

With a 20-pound platter and a 3D-printed tonearm, the turntable is priced starting at $10,000 and is due this summer.

By Greg Jaffe and Adam Entous January 8 at 6:47 PM Follow @GregJaffe The Iranian-supplied rockets were raining down on Gen. James N. Mattis\u2019s troops throughout the spring and summer of 2011 with greater and greater intensity. Six American soldiers were killed by a volley in eastern Baghdad in early June. A few weeks later, three more Americans died in a similar strike, driving the monthly death toll to 15. It was the worst month for U.S. troops in Iraq in more than two years, and Iran\u2019s proxies were vowing more rockets and more bloodshed. Mattis, the top American commander in the Middle East, was determined to send a clear message to Tehran to stop it. His proposal, crafted with the support of the ambassador and the senior American commander in Iraq, was to hit back inside Iran, said current and former senior U.S. officials, who took part in the debate. One option was a dead-of-night U.S. strike against an Iranian power plant or oil refinery, said the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations. \u201cYou could let them know that we have rockets, too,\u201d one senior U.S. official said of the options forwarded by Mattis to Washington. Mattis\u2019s proposals quickly reached the White House, which had a different view of how to curb Iran\u2019s increasingly aggressive behavior. To President Obama, a U.S. strike on Iranian soil would only inflame a volatile situation and widen a conflict that he had promised to end. Others in the White House worried that Mattis\u2019s proposal risked starting yet another war in the Middle East. The battle over how to respond to the mounting American casualties in summer 2011 reflected the deepening divide between the president and his top commander in the Middle East. In a White House worried about American overreach and the unintended consequences of military action, Mattis was the voice from the field consistently calling for a tougher response. \u201cThere were clearly White House staff who thought the recommendations he was making were too aggressive,\u201d said Leon E. Panetta, who was defense secretary at the time. \u201cBut I thought a lot of that was, frankly, not having the maturity to look at all of the options that a president should look at in order to make the right decisions.\u201d Ultimately, Mattis\u2019s advocacy and aggressive style alienated the White House and the president he was serving. Now Mattis will play a different role for a new commander in chief. As President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Pentagon, Mattis will oversee a force of nearly 1.3 million active-duty troops scattered across more than 150 countries. He will serve a president who has questioned the impartiality of America\u2019s intelligence agencies and has moved in often puzzling ways to embrace longtime adversaries, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has emphasized the value of unpredictability over careful deliberation and raw power over diplomacy. Mattis\u2019s falling out with the Obama administration, especially over Iran, offers a perspective into how the retired four-star Marine general will lead the world\u2019s largest military and the advice he will bring to Trump during the most sensitive Situation Room debates. The heated discussions in 2011 over how to respond to the Iranian rockets stretched on for weeks. \u201cThere were concerns about proportionality, effectiveness and whether the Iranians would escalate,\u201d said one former Pentagon official who took part in the discussions. \u201cCould you actually hit the guys who were responsible as opposed to some random entity? Would it be anything more than a pinprick? How do you do something more than a pinprick without starting a conflict?\u201d In the end, Mattis was authorized to take action inside Iraq against the leaders of the Iranian-backed militias. Senior White House officials said the American military response effectively deterred the Iranians and slowed the rocket attacks that were killing U.S. soldiers and Marines. Only 10 Americans died in Iraq during the last five months of 2011. \u201cIt was a very tough, tough period,\u201d a former senior White House official said. \u201cAnd it was a very tough response.\u201d Mattis and some of his allies who favored a cross-border operation had a different takeaway. The American response slowed the attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq, but it also demonstrated that the Obama White House was unwilling to take the fight directly to the Iranians, even when they drew American blood. \u201cThe American response solved the immediate problem of Iranian-backed attacks, but was not sufficient to deter Iran from further challenges to the U.S. military throughout the region,\u201d one senior U.S. official involved in the deliberations said. 3 priorities: Iran, Iran, Iran For much of the Obama presidency, Iran loomed as one of the toughest and most volatile foreign policy problems. A big part of that challenge was managing Israel, the United States\u2019 closest ally in the region, but one that might take unilateral action against Iran. Israeli leaders were sending mixed messages to Obama and his top advisers about how far they were willing to go to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Then-Defense Minister Ehud Barak briefed his Pentagon counterparts on secret plans to launch a commando-style raid on Iran\u2019s most heavily fortified nuclear site. Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence service, in turn, privately told the Americans that the Israelis could not act against Iran alone. The White House was never certain whom to believe . Mattis\u2019s job at Central Command was to be prepared if Israel triggered a war and to signal to the Iranians that the outcome of any wider conflict with the United States would be devastating for them. It was a responsibility that Mattis took seriously, sometimes too seriously for those at the White House and the State Department, current and former officials said. Soon after Mattis was tapped to lead U.S. forces in the Middle East in August 2010, Obama asked the general to spell out his top priorities. Mattis replied that he had three: \u201cNumber one Iran. Number two Iran. Number three Iran,\u201d said a senior U.S. official who was present. The general\u2019s singular focus unnerved some civilian leaders, who thought he should pay attention to a broader range of threats. His style and Marine swagger often struck the wrong chord in a White House that was focused on diplomacy and that was notably short of top officials with military experience. Mattis and his aides relentlessly drilled the U.S. military\u2019s war plan for Iran. During one planning session, which focused on the war\u2019s aftermath and included senior officials from Washington, Mattis repeatedly joked that Iran\u2019s navy would be at \u201cthe bottom of the ocean,\u201d participants said. His preparations for a possible conflict also rattled some U.S. diplomats whom Mattis invited to Central Command\u2019s regional headquarters in Qatar in 2011 for briefings on how Iran might strike back at U.S. allies and facilities. Some of the diplomats had the impression that Mattis was describing a \u201cWorld War III\u201d scenario, one ambassador said. Among the greatest dangers in the region was uncertainty, and some White House officials worried that Iran might misread Mattis\u2019s war preparations as an act of aggression. At the time, the United States had no direct channels of communication with the Iranian military to de-escalate tensions. On occasion, the U.S. military would conduct exercises designed to send messages to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps about America\u2019s seriousness. During and after those maneuvers, U.S. spy agencies would monitor the Iranians\u2019 reactions. Sometimes the Iranians missed the intended signal, suggesting to the Americans that they did not notice what the United States had done. At other times, they seemed to react to American actions that were not intended to be provocative. \u201cThe fog of war was enormous,\u201d a former senior Pentagon official said. Mattis proposed opening a direct channel with the Iranian military to mitigate the risk of miscalculation. But the White House, worried about sparking a diplomatic backlash, rejected the proposal. In this atmosphere of growing tension, Mattis began pressing for more authority to hit the Iranians hard if it looked as though Tehran was shifting to a war footing. Iran\u2019s first move in a fight with the United States or Israel probably would be to drop mines into the Strait of Hormuz, choking off the Middle East\u2019s oil supply. Mattis asked for permission to strike Iranian fast boats as soon as the United States had solid intelligence that the Iranians were loading them with mines. His rationale was that the boats were most vulnerable when they were still in port and that a swift blow could cripple Iran\u2019s war effort before it had even started. \u201cHis number one objective was to prevent the war from breaking out by being ready to preempt the Iranians,\u201d a former senior military officer said. \u201cIf he had taken the Iranian swarm boats out with mines in them, then that was going to be it for them.\u201d The White House worried that bad intelligence or a rash judgment could trigger an unnecessary war with Iran. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that if we were going to engage in an act of war in the Strait of Hormuz that the president ought to play a key role,\u201d Panetta said. But, Panetta added, it also was Mattis\u2019s job to offer the president his best military advice and options. The United States would have only a few hours to act after Iran began loading the mines. Once the mines were in place, Mattis knew reopening the strait could take three weeks and lead to U.S. casualties. The end result of the heated debate in late 2011 and early 2012 was a compromise: Obama would bypass the White House\u2019s careful and cumbersome policy process and decide on an expedited basis whether to strike the fast boats, Panetta said. America\u2019s \u2018sentinel\u2019 Mattis\u2019s bold moves were seen as helpful when the White House was trying to press Iran into talks to end its nuclear program. His brash style was also a reassurance to Israeli leaders threatening to launch unilateral strikes. The Israelis may have questioned Obama\u2019s willingness to use force against Iran to prevent it from building a nuclear bomb. But they believed Mattis was serious. In time, however, as secret talks with Iran got underway in the summer of 2012, some White House officials began to see Mattis as a potential liability. Each week, Mattis wrote a classified letter to the defense secretary that was forwarded to the White House. Typically, Mattis\u2019s updates focused on Iran\u2019s support for terrorism and its destabilizing activities throughout the region. To the White House, these threats were secondary to stopping Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and Mattis\u2019s hard-nosed approach, as outlined in the weekly letters, was seen by some as out of step with the president\u2019s top foreign diplomatic priority. Eventually, higher-ups in the Pentagon encouraged Mattis to shift his focus away from Iran and concentrate on the rest of the Central Command region, which encompassed all of the Middle East as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201cThe feedback was to tone down the Iran stuff in the letter,\u201d one former military official said. \u201cBasically, they said it wouldn\u2019t hurt to talk about something else.\u201d Mattis often said it was his role to act as America\u2019s \u201csentinel\u201d in the Middle East. He refused to soften his assessments. \u201cIt was a kind of culture clash,\u201d said Dennis Ross, who advised Obama on Iran policy. \u201cThere was such a preoccupation in the White House with not doing things that would provoke Iran or be seen as provocative. Mattis was, by definition, inclined toward doing those things that would be seen as provocative. And as time went by, this became increasingly less acceptable to them.\u201d In early 2013, the general was told he was being replaced five months early. Inside the White House, Mattis\u2019s early departure was not viewed as a firing. He had not behaved unethically or rebelled against his civilian chain of command. \u201cJim Mattis was not a runaway general,\u201d said Matthew Spence, a senior administration official who worked closely with Mattis. \u201cThere was a very unfair impression that he was coming out of the trenches and only saying go, go, go. In reality, he was one of the most thoughtful strategists in uniform that I have ever worked with.\u201d But Mattis had a different view of his departure. He was convinced that he had been dismissed early for running afoul of the White House, friends and former colleagues said. Now Mattis is poised to serve a new commander in chief whose brash approach could force the former general into a new and unfamiliar role. When Iranian naval vessels were harassing American warships this summer in the Strait of Hormuz, Trump responded with a verbal broadside . \u201cWhen they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,\u201d Trump said to thunderous applause at a campaign rally. As defense secretary, Mattis may be compelled to act as a check on an inexperienced president\u2019s instincts. There are already some signs that he is thinking along these lines and indications that his task will not be an easy one. Shortly after Trump tapped him to lead the Pentagon, Mattis asked Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, the front-runner for the defense secretary job in a Hillary Clinton White House, to consider serving as his deputy. Mattis\u2019s courtship of Flournoy suggested a bias for continuity over radical change and underscored his determination to be an independent voice in White House policy debates. Flournoy visited Trump Tower in New York to discuss the job with senior Trump foreign policy advisers. Soon after, she decided her differences with the president-elect were too deep to accept the position. Several weeks later, Mattis is still searching for a deputy. world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

    "text": "Airports Boost Security After Fort Lauderdale Shooting By WHITNEY LLOYD Jan 8, 2017, 4:31 PM ET 0 Shares Taimy Alvarez/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP WATCH Investigation of Ft. Lauderdale Airport Shooting Finds New Details 0 Shares Email There has been an increased security presence at airports across the country this weekend after a shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport left five people dead and another six people injured. The suspected gunman, Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old former National Guard soldier, flew from Anchorage, Alaska, connecting through Minneapolis and on to Fort Lauderdale on Friday morning with a gun legally checked in his luggage. He allegedly told the FBI that he took that gun and loaded it in a bathroom of Terminal 2 at the Fort Lauderdale airport and then opened fire in the baggage claim area. At New York City airports, Port Authority Police deployed officers with heavy tactical weapons, positioned armored vehicles outside terminals, stepped up K-9 patrols and increased random bag checks. In Los Angeles, police went into \"high visibility mode\" with officers patrolling terminals with long guns. Boston Logan maintained a rigorous security plan, including tactical units, commercial vehicle inspections and roadway blockades. Airports as varied in size as Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Tampa and San Diego have increased visible security on what's called the \"soft side\" of the airport -- those public areas before Transportation Security Administration checkpoints like check-in counters and baggage claim areas. In the wake of terror attacks last year in those public parts of airports in Brussels and Istanbul and a shooting at a TSA checkpoint at LAX in 2013, some security experts have suggested that a consistent presence of specially trained, armed officers stationed in those areas could help. \"It could serve not only as a deterrent but also speed up response times should a situation arise such as the one that occurred in Fort Lauderdale,\" John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ABC News contributor said. The TSA's responsibility for airport security begins and ends at the TSA checkpoint. Areas before the checkpoint are left to local authorities to patrol and secure. \"Local airport authorities should make it a priority to have uniformed law enforcement officers patrolling these nonsecured areas,\" Cohen said. \"These officers should be trained to recognize the behaviors of an individual who may be planning or preparing to carry out an attack and should also be trained to respond to a mass casualty attacker or active shooter.\" Airports nationwide declined to say how long passengers could expect to see these enhanced security measures remain in place, citing security concerns. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Jan 8, 2017 11:53 PM EST The stars of movies and television were out in force in Hollywood Sunday night for the 74th Golden Globe Awards, the first big night of awards season -- and a major bellwether for the Academy Awards -- and the night belonged to \u201cLa La Land\u201d and \u201cMoonlight.\u201d\u00a0 While Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d went home with all seven of the awards for which it was nominated, \u201cMoonlight\u201d nabbed just one Globe -- but it was a big one.\u00a0 Golden Globes 2017 list of winners \u00a0 This year\u2019s host, Jimmy Fallon, staked his claim on the show early with an opening number that riffed on the rousing musical number that opens \u201cLa La Land.\u201d The clip started with Fallon stuck in traffic on his way to the red carpet, singing along with Nicole Kidman, Amy Adams and many more.\u00a0 Golden Globes 2017 highlights The clip featured John Travolta sneaking in a \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d reference, the kids from \u201cStranger Things\u201d rapping from the back of a truck and the show\u2019s cult favorite, Barb, resurrected from the swimming pool where she disappeared.\u00a0 The \u201cLa La Land\u201d tribute continued with Fallon serenading -- and sharing a mint with -- a swooning Ryan Reynolds and dancing among the clouds with Justin Timberlake, who brought along a spot-on Fallon impression. But once the show went live things started to go wrong as the telemprompter malfunctioned, leaving Fallon to wing it.\u00a0 \u201cThis is the Golden Globes, one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote,\u201d he joked. Golden Globes 2017 red carpet While Fallon tried out some bits at the expense of Chris Rock, Matt Damon and \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d he brought along some backup from the \u201cTonight Show\u201d: Roots drummer Questlove, who served as DJ for the night. Reynolds and \u201cLa La Land\u201d star Emma Stone handed out the first award of the night, Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture, which went to Aaron Taylor-Johnson for \u201cNocturnal Animals.\u201d Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Priyanka Chopra then arrived to award Best Actor in a Television Series, Drama to Billy Bob Thornton for \u201cGoliath.\u201d\u00a0 Golden Globes 2017: Will Hollywood be in the mood to party? \u201cI do have to thank the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for picking me over Bob Odenkirk,\u201d Thornton joked, fabricating a feud with the \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d actor dating back to the 1940s.\u00a0 Hugh Grant then took the stage to introduce a look at his film, \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d -- but only after a technical issue caused the announcement to call Grant \u201calready a Golden Globe winner tonight.\u201d\u00a0 Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant then handed out the award for Best Actress in a Television Comedy, which went to \u201cblack-ish\u201d star Tracee Ellis Ross, who beat out \u201cVeep\u201d star Julia-Louis Dreyfus and last year\u2019s winner, \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d star Rachel Bloom, among others. \u201cThis is for all the women, women of color and colorful people who\u2019s stories are always not considered worthy or valid,\u201d Ross said during her speech.\u00a0 Barrymore and Olyphant then stuck around to announce the Best Television Series, Musical or Comedy, which went to Donald Glover\u2019s freshman series \u201cAtlanta.\u201d\u00a0 Meryl Streep slams Donald Trump in Golden Globes acceptance speech Sticking with the television categories, Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon then took the stage to award Sarah Paulson Best Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie for \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d -- the same role for which Paulson won an Emmy in September.\u00a0 Kidman and Witherspoon then announced the winner for Best Limited Series or TV Movie, which netted another win for \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson.\u201d\u00a0 Naomi Campbell and Matt Bomer then handed out another award for Limited Series or TV Movie, with Hugh Laurie taking Best Supporting Actor for \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d Laurie got political with his speech, worrying that this would be the last Golden Globes: \u201cIt has Hollywood, foreign and press in its name, so I just don\u2019t know,\u201d he cracked. \u201cI think to some Republicans, even the word \u2018association\u2019 is slightly sketchy.\u201d Sting and Carrie Underwood announced a pair of music-based awards, starting with the winner for Best Original Score, which went to Justin Hurwitz, securing the first award of the night for \u201cLa La Land.\u201d\u00a0 Best Original Song also went to \u201cLa La Land,\u201d for the track \u201cCity of Stars.\u201d\u00a0 Michael Keaton announced the winner for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture -- Viola Davis for \u201cFences\u201d -- but not before mangling the name of nominee Octavia Spencer\u2019s film, calling it \u201cHidden Fences,\u201d which may or may not have been a nod to Jenna Bush\u2019s screw-up on the red carpet during a chat with Pharrell Williams.\u00a0 Kristen Bell and a rather rambunctious Cuba Gooding Jr. took the stage to present the award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Limited Series or TV Movie, which went to Olivia Colman for \u201cThe Night Manager\u201d -- though she wasn\u2019t present to accept it. Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn then came out to comically butcher the reading of the nominees for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical before finally introducing the winner: Ryan Gosling, for \u201cLa La Land,\u201d greatly increasing the chances for the film to sweep all of its nominated categories.\u00a0 Gosling used his speech to pay tribute to his partner, Eva Mendes, and their two daughters before dedicating the award to Mendes\u2019 late brother.\u00a0 \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d stars Felicity Jones and Diego Luna continued the \u201cLa La Land\u201d sweep by giving Damien Chazelle the award for Best Screenplay.\u00a0 Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig introduced the Best Animated Film category, but not before they could share anecdotes about their first experiences watching an animated film that got very, very dark. Disney ended up taking the trophy, winning with \u201cZootopia.\u201d\u00a0 The trailer for Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds\u2019 new documentary just came out and it\u2019s heartbreaking Fallon then introduced a special tribute to Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher, honoring the mother-daughter duo who died less than two weeks ago.\u00a0 Though they play superheroes for rival companies, Chris Hemsworth and Gal Gadot came together to present the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, which went to France\u2019s \u201cElle,\u201d starring Isabelle Huppert, whom director Paul Verhoeven lauded from the stage.\u00a0 Anna Kendrick and Justin Theroux then announced Best Actor in a TV Series, Drama, which went to Tom Hiddleston , bringing home a third Globe for \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d\u00a0 Best Actress in a TV Series, Drama went to \u201cThe Crown\u201d star Claire Foy, beating out stars from \u201cThe Americans,\u201d \u201cWestworld\u201d and \u201cStranger Things.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI think the world could do with a few more women at the center of it,\u201d Foy said while paying tribute to her character, Queen Elizabeth II. The series also won for Best Drama Series, besting awards juggernaut HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\u00a0 Viola Davis then took the stage to pay tribute to the evening\u2019s recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for Lifetime Achievement, Meryl Streep. \u201cShe is an observer and a thief,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI can only imagine where you go, Meryl, when you disappear into a character.\u201d\u00a0 Audiences were then treated to a montage of Streep\u2019s 40 years on the silver screen, 30 Golden Globe nominations and eight wins.\u00a0 A very tearful Streep apologized for having lost her voice prior to the ceremony. \u201cThere was one performance this year that stung me,\u201d she said, referring to Donald Trump\u2019s mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter. \u201cI still can\u2019t get it out of my head because it wasn\u2019t in a movie.\u201d Golden Globes 2017 highlights \u201cDisrespect invites disrespect,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhen the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.\u201d Streep then called for an emboldened press to hold those in power accountable.\u00a0 Streep ended with a tribute to Carrie Fisher, relating advice the late actress had given her: \u201cTake your broken heart; turn it into art.\u201d \u201cLa La Land\u201d auteur Damien Chazelle then took home the Golden Globe for Best Director, while Donald Glover won for Best Actor in a Television Series, Musical or Comedy.\u00a0 Matt Damon then took the stage to present Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy to \u201cLa La Land\u201d star -- and Oscar frontrunner -- Emma Stone.\u00a0 \u201cI moved here 13 years ago this week,\u201d she said, thanking her family for their support. \u201cThis is a film for dreamers. I think hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world.\u201d \u201cHidden Fences\u201d trends after Golden Globes flubs Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne then took the stage -- after Fallon had pointed out that their names rhyme -- to present \u201cLa La Land\u201d with its final award of the night, Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy, cementing the film\u2019s sweep of its awards for the night.\u00a0 Brie Larson presented Best Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama to this season\u2019s frontrunner, Casey Affleck for \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d while Leonardo DiCaprio returned to present Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama. That trophy went to \u201cElle\u201d star Isabelle Huppert. \u00a0 Sylvester Stallone and Carl Weathers then re-teamed to present the final award of the night, Best Motion Picture, Drama, which went to indie drama \u201cMoonlight,\u201d directed by Barry Jenkins.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Here's everything you need to know about the 74th annual show that honors the best in TV and film. It airs Sunday at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT\u00a0on\u00a0NBC The show, which takes place at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif.,\u00a0will air live from coast to coast.\u00a0E! will have a\u00a0Red Carpet Live\u00a0arrival special starting at 7 p.m. ET, and Ryan Seacrest will begin NBC's pre-show coverage at 6 p.m ET. You can stream the show only if... ... you have a cable subscription. You need to select your TV provider to watch NBC from a streaming device. The red carpet will\u00a0 stream on Twitter \u00a0starting at 6 p.m. ET. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association picks the winners The HFPA is a small group of about 90 international journalists that are based in Southern California. Since the group is small (and has been accused of unfairly voting for glamorous stars), so\u00a0winners tend to be unpredictable. It's like the pre-game for the Oscars The Academy Awards is the most prestigious of the awards shows. The three-hour Golden Globes, on the other hand,\u00a0is a place where stars can try out fashion, sample parts of speeches and, frankly, get drunk. Talent in both TV and film are honored at the ceremony. ",

Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images An orca leaps out of the water at Shamu Stadium at SeaWorld San Diego. Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images Just days after the death of its most famous star, SeaWorld has begun the process of putting its headliner show to rest. The theme park's San Diego location is delivering its final One Ocean show on Sunday, ending the series of orca performances that elicited outrage after the 2013 documentary Blackfish. The principal subject of that documentary, an orca named Tilikum, died Friday at the age of 36. Tilikum, SeaWorld's Famed Orca And Subject Of 'Blackfish,' Dies The filmmakers pointed to the aggressive behavior of the nearly six-ton male orca as evidence of the cruelty \u2014 and the dangers \u2014 of holding these whales in captivity. Amid the outcry (and plunging stock value ) that followed, SeaWorld promised changes to its program. In 2015, SeaWorld CEO Joel Manby announced that the signature orca performances would abandon the traditional tricks and stunts in favor of a more informative show, in a more natural setting. Sunday's One Ocean finale in San Diego is the fruit of that promise. SeaWorld's locations in San Antonio, Texas, and Orlando, Fla., are expected to follow suit and end their versions of the popular show by 2019. In its place, SeaWorld will be introducing Orca Encounter , a series of shows it describes as a more educational experience. \"No longer a theatrical show, this live presentation will have the feel of an engaging documentary centered on the orca's natural behaviors, physical attributes, intelligence, social structures and unique relationship with mankind,\" according to a statement from the park. The San Diego Union-Tribune breaks down the changes visitors can expect : \"The reimagined orca attraction, billed as an educational presentation, will lose the current stage setting, now dominated by four LED screens and a giant depiction of a whale tail. Replacing it will be a new backdrop that incorporates a rugged coastal inlet, artificial Douglas fir trees, cliffs and waterfalls. An infinity high-definition screen will highlight orca movements in the wild, as well as replays of SeaWorld killer whale maneuvers in the stadium pool. \"In what will still be a pre-produced presentation with designated start times, trainers will cue the orcas through a series of more natural behaviors typical of killer whales in the wild \u2014 hunting, eating, communicating \u2014 accompanied by an informative narrative.\" Article continues after sponsorship Many of the theme park's critics don't buy that the changes will have a significant effect, however. \"The trainers aren't safe, and the whales aren't happy,\" Gabriela Cowperthwaite, the director of Blackfish, told CBS News . \"They're still just doing manic circles around concrete swimming pools.\" Naomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist with the Animal Welfare Institute, tells The Union-Tribune that while she appreciates the changes as steps in the right direction, they don't go far enough. \"Hopefully, SeaWorld will put these (orca) behaviors into context and stop exaggerating them and having them somersault in the air, which they never do in the wild,\" she said. \"Trust me, when a whale does a breach, even in the wild on a whale watch, everyone still goes aah. It's a huge, gasping moment.\" Last year, SeaWorld said that it would be ending its program of breeding in captivity. The Associated Press reports SeaWorld still has 11 orcas, which range in age from 2 to 52 years old. The park announced in December that when it opens a new park in Abu Dhabi, in 2022, it will do so without orcas entirely. ",

    "text": "DEC. 30, 2016 By The New York Times Jamie S. Gorelick, a WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration, said that while plans were not final, Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business. \u201cMr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,\u201d she said. He will resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, and though the law does not require it, she said he would divest \u201csubstantial assets.\u201d She did not name them, but Ms. Heller said they would include his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue. Just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen. Mr. Kushner\u2019s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies\u2019 properties, and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 Fifth Avenue. He also has a stake, through a family investment vehicle, in a private equity firm run by his brother, Joshua, with far-flung investments of its own. Mr. Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. Already he is involved in steering policy, making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders, the White House and the president-elect in ways that could affect his business, even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the president-elect\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner played a pivotal role in persuading Mr. Trump, who made the Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs a b\u00eate noire of his presidential campaign, to appoint the firm\u2019s president, Gary D. Cohn , as his chief economic adviser, according to several people involved in the transition. (Like a number of people interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.) Goldman Sachs has lent the Kushner Companies money and is an investor in a real estate technology company co-founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother. Photo A Bank Hapoalim branch in Tel Aviv. The bank has given multiple loans to Kushner Companies. Credit Nir Elias/Reuters Mr. Trump has said that his son-in-law, an Orthodox Jew, will play a central role in dealings with Israel , describing him as so talented that he could help \u201cdo peace in the Middle East.\u201d Mr. Kushner\u2019s company has received multiple loans from Israel\u2019s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim. The incoming Trump administration will inherit a Justice Department investigation into allegations that the bank helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, despite a lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of America\u2019s most complicated diplomatic relationships. Such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention should be relayed through his son-in-law, according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement. So when the Chinese ambassador to the United States called the White House in early December to express what one official called China\u2019s \u201cdeep displeasure\u201d at Mr. Trump\u2019s break with longstanding diplomatic tradition by speaking by phone with the president of Taiwan , the White House did not call the president-elect\u2019s national security team. Instead, it relayed that information through Mr. Kushner, whose company was not only in the midst of discussions with Anbang but also has Chinese investors. Ethics experts said that while the conflict-of-interest law is narrowly drawn, Mr. Kushner\u2019s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions. Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, said deals like the one with Anbang \u201cmight not be illegal under the conflict-of-interest rules, but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner\u2019s business to try to influence U.S. policy.\u201d Without knowing details of Mr. Kushner\u2019s holdings and divestiture plans, he said, the merits of his proposal are hard to assess. Even if he divests his stake in certain properties, Mr. Sanderson added, \u201cit strikes me as a half-measure\u201d that \u201cstill poses a real conflict-of-interest issue and would be a drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and cause the American people to question Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in policy making.\u201d Photo From left, Josh, Charles and Jared Kushner, in 2014. The family has extensive holdings in real estate and private equity firms. Credit Patrick McMullan The Family Business Like the president-elect, Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful father. In the 1980s, his father, Charles Kushner, took over the New Jersey-based construction business started by his own father, a Holocaust survivor from Poland. Charles expanded into office buildings and apartments, eventually assembling a $1 billion real estate business and becoming a leading Democratic donor , contributing to politicians in New Jersey and New York and winning appointment to the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But the company was upended when Charles became engulfed in a nasty family feud over how the business\u2019s proceeds were to be distributed. The fight, which played out in a federal courthouse in Newark, resulted in a plea deal for Charles, who in 2005 was sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations. The family infighting was so bitter that, at one point, Charles hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, videotaped the encounter and sent the footage to his sister. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jared, 23 at the time of his father\u2019s conviction, had recently graduated from Harvard. He was studying for an M.B.A. and law degree at New York University in 2006 when he bought The New York Observer, at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city\u2019s elite and high-end real estate. It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business. The company now says he became chief executive in 2008, but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012. Nevertheless, Mr. Kushner quickly became the company\u2019s public face as it expanded across the Hudson River into Manhattan, much as Mr. Trump had left Queens for the big city decades before. Charles Kushner was released from federal custody in August 2006. He immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today. Still, it was with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever: $1.8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day. It was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the United States \u2014 and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier. Around this time, Mr. Kushner met the woman he would marry: Ivanka Trump. \u201cJ-Vanka,\u201d the headlines blared , as the New York tabloids celebrated a match made in real estate heaven. Everything was looking up, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Within a year after the deal, the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans \u2014 and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue. To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity firm; Vornado Realty Trust, then a co-owner of two of Mr. Trump\u2019s largest properties; and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men. In the end, Mr. Kushner\u2019s company survived, and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international boldface-name circuit. In August, they were spotted with Wendi Deng, an ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, on the 453-foot yacht Rising Sun, owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen. Several weeks later, they were photographed watching the United States Open tennis finals with the art collector Dasha Zhukova, wife of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle. Since 2012, Kushner Companies has been on a buying spree. It has acquired at least 120 properties, mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New Jersey, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, a research firm. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Recent deals include the $340 million acquisition of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and $345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land. Mr. Kushner\u2019s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times building for $295 million in 2015 from Lev Leviev, an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia. Increasingly, the company is branching out across the country \u2014 to Philadelphia; Baltimore; Toledo, Ohio; and Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of AT&T. In all, the company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.

Credit Jean Catuffe/GC Images Investors and Creditors As the Kushners have expanded their businesses, they have also, by necessity, expanded their universe of investors and creditors. Lenders have included private equity giants like Blackstone, the French bank Natixis and Goldman Sachs. Another lender is Deutsche Bank, which recently reached a $7.2 billion settlement with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities. But it remains under investigation over allegations that it disguised trades that helped Russian clients move money offshore. Beyond real estate, Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall Street, health care and tech spaces. He has an indirect investment in Thrive Capital, a venture capital firm valued at about $1.5 billion that is run by his brother, Joshua. The company has made more than 100 investments in dozens of companies, both in the United States and abroad. Among them is Oscar , a health insurance company founded in 2012 to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle. Oscar\u2019s investors have included Li Ka-shing, who is one of Hong Kong\u2019s richest men, and China\u2019s Ping An Insurance, which has close ties to relatives of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China.

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times The Kushner brothers have counted the Russian billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner and the Chinese billionaire founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, as investors in another endeavor \u2014 Cadre , a tech-savvy real estate investment company they started with a friend. Goldman Sachs has invested in both tech ventures. But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner\u2019s real-estate investments remains a mystery. While the company lists dozens of partners on its website, it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies. One of the newest Kushner projects \u2014 a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in November in Jersey City \u2014 got nearly a quarter of its financing, about $50 million, from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified. The investors are beneficiaries of a federal program that grants two-year visas and a path to permanent residency in exchange for investments of $500,000. The program, known as EB-5, has become popular with real estate developers as a cheap form of financing; in fiscal year 2015, the State Department issued 9,764 of the visas \u2014 overwhelmingly to applicants from China . Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the program, which must be renewed periodically by Congress, has lately come under fire . The Government Accountability Office has issued several reports raising concerns about what it termed the program\u2019s insufficient background checks and lax safeguards against illicit financing. One applicant, the agency found, failed to report potential financial ties to a string of Chinese brothels . Then there are the Kushners\u2019 continuing negotiations with Anbang\u2019s Mr. Wu, one of the most politically connected men in China. Photo Kushner Companies\u2019 real estate holdings include, clockwise from top left, 666 Fifth Avenue; the former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses headquarters in Brooklyn; the old New York Times building; and Trump Bay Street in Jersey City. Credit Photographs by Pablo Enriquez for The New York Times, except top right by Edward Caruso for The New York Times Anbang Draws Scrutiny In 2015, Mr. Kushner began pursuing a grand vision for 666 Fifth Avenue. The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the 40-story, 1950s-era aluminum-clad office building, adding apartments, a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1,400 feet. But the plan needed money, and while Mr. Kushner had managed to hang on to his family\u2019s flagship building, it still had a lot of debt, with a $1.1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant. Anbang, which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004, had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate, and had begun investing in hotels. But it had encountered problems of its own; its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington. The Times reported last year that Anbang is owned by a few dozen companies, which in turn are owned by a number of shell companies that are controlled by roughly 100 people, many of whom have ties to a county in China that is the home of Mr. Wu, whose own power stems in part from marriage. In his case he married Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era. Mr. Wu also counts as a central business partner the son of a People\u2019s Liberation Army marshal, and he has recruited several former government insurance regulators to serve on his board. Photo Wu Xiaohui, the chairman and chief executive of Anbang Insurance, a Chinese financial behemoth which owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel and controls as much as $285 billion in assets. Credit Ben Asen/International Insurance Society Anbang\u2019s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, have opted not to advise the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their \u201cknow your client\u201d guidelines. Anbang\u2019s deep ties to the Chinese state have also led to a break in presidential protocol. Presidents have long stayed at the Waldorf, but when Mr. Obama visited New York for the opening of a session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, he decided to seek other accommodations . American officials were vague about the reasons for the change at the time; a senior national security official cited security, counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns. Advertisement Continue reading the main story National security concerns have also complicated Anbang\u2019s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States. One deal, to buy the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or state-connected companies. The Hotel del Coronado is near a naval base, and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny. Anbang was, however, able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection. Last year, Anbang tried to purchase the Starwood Hotels chain, outbidding Marriott with a $14 billion offer . It was widely reported that the deal would be subject to review by the committee. But though the parties expressed confidence that it would pass muster, ultimately Anbang walked away from the deal before submitting the kind of detailed inside information that process would entail. And while Anbang\u2019s planned $1.57 billion purchase of Des Moines-based Fidelity & Guaranty Life, first announced in November 2015, was cleared by the committee, also known as Cfius, it stalled after the New York State Department of Financial Services demanded more information about Anbang\u2019s shareholding structure. Photo Mr. Kushner, left, met with President Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Denis McDonough, at the White House on Nov. 10. Credit Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images But Anbang was nothing if not savvy. Company officials had cultivated a relationship with Benjamin M. Lawsky, who had earlier led the financial services agency, from May 2011 to June 2015. It was Mr. Lawsky, by then a consultant, who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies, according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about. Mr. Lawsky declined to comment. Mr. Kushner led the negotiations, his spokeswoman, Ms. Heller, confirmed. Kushner Companies would disclose little else about the joint venture, except to say that Anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building\u2019s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized. Anbang declined to comment. It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner\u2019s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election, Ms. Heller said, adding that it had been in the works for a while. By the time of the meeting, Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships, including the one with Anbang, to others at Kushner Companies, according to Ms. Heller, and it was for that reason that he invited his father and Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies. She said he planned to sell his stake in 666 Fifth before the closing of any Anbang deal, but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price Mr. Kushner hoped to get. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Heller stressed in her statement that the United States has \u201cnot found Anbang to be a state-owned enterprise\u201d \u2014 an important technical point, given that the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments. Should it consummate its deal with Anbang, she said, Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government. She expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee, citing the fact that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria. Come Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, that committee will be made up of his cabinet members, and the process is such that the president has the final say. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More It is a process with which Mr. Trump has some familiarity. During the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting, as secretary of state and member of the foreign investment committee, a deal that benefited donors to her family\u2019s charitable foundation while giving the Russians control of about 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium-extraction capacity. On China, Mr. Trump has talked a tough game, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war. But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen. The president-elect has his own financial entanglements with China: He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly $950 million to a group of lenders that includes the Bank of China, and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is another state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. With Anbang a magnet for controversy, Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps. But a week after the Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf, Mr. Kushner\u2019s father and Mr. Wu met at the hotel for lunch. After the elder Mr. Kushner departed, Mr. Wu was clearly elated. \u201cI love you guys,\u201d he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage, according to one person present.

By Margaret Sullivan Media Columnist January 8 at 4:00 PM Follow @sulliview Fake news is a real thing \u2014 as evidenced by these wholly invented stories created in Macedonia with the intent of fooling U.S. audiences. But the phrase is now being used as a catch-all insult and has lost its meaning. \u200b (Raphael Satter/AP) When Jim DeMint wanted to dis a TV interviewer\u2019s suggestion that Obamacare has merits as well as flaws, the former senator and tea partyer used a handy putdown: \u201cYou can put all that under the category of fake news.\u201d When conspiracy theorist Alex Jones wanted to deny a CNN report that Ivanka Trump would take over the East Wing offices traditionally occupied by the first lady, he used the same label. And when a writer for an arch-conservative website needed a putdown for ABC\u2019s chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, he reached for the obvious: \u201cfake-news propagandist.\u201d Fake news has a real meaning \u2014 deliberately constructed lies, in the form of news articles, meant to mislead the public. For example: The one falsely claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump, or the one alleging without basis that Hillary Clinton would be indicted just before the election. But though the term hasn\u2019t been around long, its meaning already is lost. Faster than you could say \u201cPizzagate,\u201d the label has been co-opted to mean any number of completely different things: Liberal claptrap. Or opinion from left-of-center. Or simply anything in the realm of news that the observer doesn\u2019t like to hear. \u201cThe speed with which the term became polarized and in fact a rhetorical weapon illustrates how efficient the conservative media machine has become,\u201d said George Washington University professor Nikki Usher. As Jeremy Peters wrote in the New York Times: \u201cConservative cable and radio personalities, top Republicans and even Mr. Trump himself . . . have appropriated the term and turned it against any news they see as hostile to their agenda.\u201d So, here\u2019s a modest proposal for the truth-based community. Let\u2019s get out the hook and pull that baby off stage. Yes: Simply stop using it. Instead, call a lie a lie. Call a hoax a hoax. Call a conspiracy theory by its rightful name. After all, \u201cfake news\u201d is an imprecise expression to begin with. \u201cFake news means different things to different people,\u201d Usher told me. \u201cIs it satire? Comedy news? Partisan conspiracy? Partisan journalism? Big mistakes reliable news institutions have made, or hoaxes they fell for?\u201d What\u2019s more, the term is being used to discredit \u2014 or at least muddy the waters for \u2014 legitimate fact-checking efforts. Glenn Kessler, who writes The Post\u2019s Fact Checker, put it this way: \u201cPeople seem to confuse reporting mistakes by established news organizations with obviously fraudulent news produced by Macedonian teenagers.\u201d (BuzzFeed reported in early November that young Macedonians were setting up sites on Facebook devoted to click-baity, pro-Trump deception, and reaping advertising profits.) Kessler noted that he\u2019s often asked by readers to investigate \u201cfake news\u201d that is nothing more than a correctable error in legitimate journalism. BuzzFeed, meanwhile, is digging deeper into the rise of deliberate deception in the form of news stories, with the appointment of debunking expert Craig Silverman, formerly of Poynter.org, as its media editor. Breitbart News \u2014 long run by Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 took a whack at that move in an article titled, \u201cHow BuzzFeed Editor Craig Silverman Helped Generate the \u2018Fake News\u2019 Crisis.\u201d Its point: That BuzzFeed ginned up the left\u2019s concern over these online lies by reporting on them just before the election when they had actually been around all along. (Breitbart writer Jerome Hudson noted that the Guardian had reported on the Macedonian sites earlier, but BuzzFeed\u2019s piece made it go viral.) Don\u2019t get me wrong. Lies in the form of news stories are a real problem, and in need of real attention. That became abundantly clear when a North Carolina man carried his assault rifle into a Washington, D.C., pizzeria recently to \u201cself-investigate\u201d what he\u2019d read on the Internet: made-up nonsense about a nonexistent child prostitution ring involving Hillary Clinton. We need to find a way to talk about it. Usher, for one, isn\u2019t ready to dispense with the term because she thinks it serves a purpose for \u201cthe politically independent, moderately informed, regular voter . . . who hasn\u2019t decamped yet to polarized media\u201d \u2014 a way to express concern about mistakes, misinformation and conspiracy all at once. Indeed, all those problems are real, and discussing them important. But putting them all in a blender and slapping on a fuzzy name doesn\u2019t move us forward. \u201cFake news\u201d has had its 15 minutes of fame. Let\u2019s put this tainted term out of its misery.

This Friday, May 16, 2014, file photo, shows the General Motors logo at the company's world headquarters in Detroit. (Paul Sancya / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter General Motors has no plans to change where it produces small cars because of criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, the company's top executive said Sunday night. CEO Mary Barra said the auto business has long lead times for where it produces vehicles, with decisions are made two to four years ahead. Last week Trump threatened on Twitter to slap a border tax on GM for importing the compact Chevrolet Cruze to the U.S. from Mexico. As it turns out, GM only imports a small number of Cruze hatchbacks from Mexico and Barra said it makes all of the sedans at a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, near Cleveland. Asked if she was worried about a possible tariff, Barra said it was too early to speculate on that. GM's strategy, she said, has much more in common with Trump's goals for trade and jobs than differences. \"I very much look forward to being part of the solution that allows the country to be strengthened along with business, along with our manufacturing capability,\" she said on the sidelines of an event unveiling the new GMC Terrain small SUV. Production of the Terrain will move to Mexico from a plant in Ingersoll, Canada, for the new model year. The Ingersoll plan will still make the Equinox, GM's best-selling small SUV. ",

The man was captured by the special forces of the state of Jalisco, and handed over to federal prosecutors, according to a tweet from the state of Jalisco. The Mexican attorney general's office and Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement this evening that \"an individual from the United States, allegedly involved in this incident was located and detained. The same individual will be expelled and repatriated to the United States of America where his legal status will be determined.\" The officer, identified by Mexican prosecutors as Christopher Ashcraft, was shot in his car on Friday as he was leaving the consulate. He was listed in stable condition. Surveillance video of the attack shows the shooter following the official in a parking garage. A second video shows the attacker waiting until the victim arrives at the exit to the garage, then fires a round through the car's windshield and immediately runs away. A Mexican official has called the shooting a \"direct attack,\" but authorities have said they do not know the motive. The State Department said it is working closely with Mexico on the case. Secretary of State John Kerry thanked Mexico for the quick work making an arrest in the shooting. \"On behalf of President Obama and the people of the United States, I want to thank the Government of Mexico for their swift and decisive arrest of a suspect in the heinous attack against our Foreign Service Officer colleague in Guadalajara, Mexico,\" he said. \"My thoughts and prayers remain with this officer and his family during this difficult time. I wish him a speedy recovery.\" 0 Shares ",
