    "text": "Jan 5 2017, 3:54 pm ET Department Stores Are Paying the Price for Underestimating Amazon by Martha C. White advertisement Department stores across the country are paying the price for underestimating Amazon this holiday season. Macy's and Kohl's both reported lower-than-expected sales during the all-important end-of-year retail period, and announced a spate of store closures that will lead to thousands of lost jobs. Sears has even been reduced to selling off one of its iconic brands after a double-digit sales slide. Industry observers blame online competition, as well as department store brands' own shortfalls in adapting to a fundamental shift in consumer behavior. \"For both retailers, the consistent themes of the shortfalls are weak traffic between Black Friday and Christmas,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann wrote in a research note addressing the bad news from Macy's and Kohl's, which drove both companies' stock prices lower by double-digit percentages by midday Thursday. Also on Thursday, Sears Holdings announced that it would sell off its Craftsman tools brand \u2014 considered one of the struggling company's prize assets \u2014 to Stanley Black & Decker for $775 million, and said sales at Sears and Kmart stores slid as much as 13 percent during the holidays. Amazon Takes the Prize Many point a finger at Amazon. The company, which reports quarterly results at the end of the month, characterized this holiday season as the \"best-ever\" in a press release issued two days after Christmas. \"[Amazon] may well have walked away with almost all the growth in e-commerce again, as well as taking share from brick and mortar stores,\" Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said via email. \"Traditional retail definitely continues to struggle in the face of stronger e-commerce sales.\" According to data from Adobe, stores raked in a collective $91.7 billion in online sales during November and December, an 11 percent increase from the previous year and $115 million higher than Adobe had predicted. Related: Online Sales Hit a Record $91.7 Billion Over the Holiday Period Department stores failed to adapt quickly enough to the online shopping boom in general \u2014 and underestimated the threat posed by Amazon in particular. \"Consumers are shopping in different ways and in different channels. It's happening so rapidly that they are losing share on the whole,\" said Liz Dunn, founder and CEO of Talmage Advisors. \"That's likely going to continue \u2014 they've been market share losers for 15, 20 years,\" she said. \"There's a hastening of the pace now because of the growth in e-commerce.\" Too Late for Catch-Up By the time many traditional department stores grasped the idea that customers wanted the same items in stores and online, at the same prices, their pure-play online competitors were moving on to sophisticated algorithm-based upselling and fostering a dialogue with shoppers by encouraging online reviews and continued contact via email or apps. \"Omnichannel is old and obsolete\u2026 Now we have to move on,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group. \"What they have to do is sell before, during, and after the transaction,\" he said. Instead, too many simply focused on pricing, which Dunn called a \"race to the bottom.\" Primed not to pay full price, consumers held out for sales and price-checked items before purchase as a matter of course \u2014 which put traditional department stores at a disadvantage. Related: Check This List to See if Your Local Sears, Kmart, or Macy's is Closing \"Customers shopped smart, which contributed to margin pressure,\" Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. analyst Richard Jaffe said in a research note. \"It's becoming increasingly clear that Amazon has built all kinds of very strong differentiators across logistics, brand, selection, and more that are making it very tough for others to compete on level footing,\" Dawson said. Out of Touch Shoppers this year also were less interested in clothes and accessories like handbags and watches \u2014 key department store categories. \"The hot products this year weren't traditional items that the department stores carry,\" Cohen said. Even relying on aggressive promotions didn't do department stores any favors, since that often came at the expense of product differentiation, brand loyalty and the in-store experience. \"The consumer is looking for more interesting, more compelling assortments,\" Dunn said. \"They're not so interested in just shopping based on price, to the extent they're looking for an in-store experience.\" If customers are going to bother going to a brick-and-mortar store today, they want special products and customized service. \"There's not as much of an emphasis on the strength of the product, the quality of the service,\" she said. \"The overall trend of department stores losing market share\u2026 is going to continue.\" Martha C.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic But bureaucratic turf wars have dogged the office of the director of national intelligence since its creation. Officials who run the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency, among others, have sought to maintain control over parts of the spying apparatus, and to exert influence with presidents and members of Congress. In 2009, for example, Leon E. Panetta, President Obama\u2019s incoming C.I.A. director, clashed with Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence at the time, after Mr. Blair sought to select the top American spies for overseas postings. Mr. Panetta sent a dispatch to the agency\u2019s employees telling them to ignore Mr. Blair\u2019s message \u2014 an assertion that the C.I.A. was in charge. The rivalries have weakened the national intelligence office and led some critics in the government to question its effectiveness. The year that Mr. Obama took office, an internal report criticized the office of national intelligence for adding to \u2014 not removing \u2014 bureaucratic bloat and doing little to end the tensions among the various spy agencies. In 2010, James R. Clapper Jr., the current director of national intelligence, insisted during his Senate confirmation hearings that he would not be a \u201chood ornament,\u201d saying that despite the inherent limitations on his job, he would try to bring an end to turf battles among the nation\u2019s spy agencies. Six years later, the job appears to have limited appeal to some intelligence professionals, several of whom were not eager to serve in the position for fear that they would not be empowered. Mr. Coats had been an early and strong contender for secretary of defense in the first term of President George W. Bush, until Mr. Bush\u2019s vice president, Dick Cheney, successfully pressed for Donald H. Rumsfeld. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Coats, 73, graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois, and served in the Army before studying at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. He began a career in life insurance in Fort Wayne, Ind., before joining the office of then-Representative Dan Quayle as a district representative.

One victim's daughter wept and grew angry as she recalled learning about the June 17, 2015 attack at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Another victim's daughter broke down as she described her mother's hugs. A third victim's sister cried when prosecutors displayed family photos. They were among 38 witnesses that the government said it plans to have testify to make the case for Roof's execution. The penalty phase of the trial began on Wednesday, and is expected to last about 10 days. Related: At Dylann Roof Penalty Trial, Victims' Families Shift Focus From the Killer Each of the witnesses have given highly emotional descriptions of victims, and several have wept before the jury. One of the most emotional recollections came from Denise Quarles, daughter of Myra Thompson, one of the nine people Roof shot to death after inviting him to join their evening Bible study class. Her memories of Thompson triggered tears, and then fury as she recalled learning that the killings had occurred in a sanctuary that had been integral to her family's life. \"For that to happen where I call home, it pisses me off,\" Denise Quarles said. Denise Quarles, daughter of Myra Thompson, at the trial on Thursday. Art Lien Quarles later shared a dream she had just before the attack in which her mother drowned. \"I knew that was my mom letting me know something happened,\" Quarles said, crying again. Several people in the packed courtroom in Charleston dabbed tears. Some got up and left. The outburst prompted a complaint from Roof, who is representing himself in the trial's penalty phase, and a warning from U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel that the testimony had toed the line on what was legally acceptable. Gergel told the jury that they could only consider the personal characteristics of the victim, and how their death impacted the witness \u2014 not the witness' feelings about the crime.

Related: Dylann Roof Tells Jury: 'There Is Nothing Wrong With Me Psychologically' Gergel then dismissed the jury and turned to prosecutors, asking how many more witnesses they planned to call \u2014 they'd submitted an initial list of 38 \u2014 and requested they be \"efficient.\" The judge said he would not deny any family members and friends the chance to speak, but he also had to make sure the testimony wasn't violating Roof's due process rights. \"The defense raises a good point that at some point it's going to be too much,\" Gergel said. \"Our guiding light must be a fair process.\" Roof's standby defense lawyer, David Bruck, grew frustrated, telling Gergel that Roof \"cannot protect his own rights.\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson shot back, \"He's the one who chose to kill nine people.\" Gergel denied Bruck's request to help Roof make objections, saying Roof had done a decent job so far. Rita Whidbee, best friend of Sharonda Coleman-Middleton, at the trial on Thursday. Art Lien The testimony continued with Rita Whidbee, a friend of victim Sharonda Coleman-Singleton. Whidbee cried on the stand as the court played a recording of Coleman-Singleton speaking during a funeral a week before the shooting. Coleman-Singleton's daughter came next. Cam'ryne Singleton cried hard as she recalled her mother's hugs. Singleton was followed by Bethane Middleton-Brown, sister of victim DePayne Middleton-Doctor. She, too, wept, after the court displayed photos of Middleton-Doctor. Two of Middleton-Doctor's daughters, Gracyn Middleton-Doctor and Kaylin Doctor, remembered their mother's readiness to sacrifice for family and for people she didn't know. Daniel Simmons Jr., son of the Rev. Daniel Simmons, recounted his panicked drive from Virginia to Charleston after the shooting, learning on the way that his father was going to die. Roof did not object or ask any of them questions. Gabe Gutierrez ",

    "text": "Read the story Angelenos may remember the 2005 storm because it was the first time it rained on the Rose Parade in 51 years. But Tolby, who lives in Lake Tahoe, remembers the storm differently. \u201cIt was pretty wild. I was here in 2005 and it was definitely the hardest rain I\u2019d ever seen. It didn\u2019t stop for 24 hours,\u201d he said. This weekend\u2019s storm could bring 36 straight hours of heavy rain from Mammoth Mountain to Susanville, Tolby said. In the mountains, the rain could pile onto the snow and trigger early snow melts, feeding extra water into watersheds already swollen from a week of rain. \u201cA combination of intense rain on saturated soils will lead to excessive runoff,\u201d the National Weather Service said in its weekend forecast. The Carson, Truckee and Susan rivers are all expected to become overwhelmed and the nearby communities may become increasingly isolated if the deluge triggers mud flows and rock slides. In Mono County, authorities offered sandbags to residents in preparation for the rain. In Yosemite National Park, authorities are cautioning visitors to check with the park before heading in \u2014\u00a0the weekend storm could close Yosemite if the Merced River floods, they said. Colfax, known as the turnaround town, is ready. \"It's something we prepare for \u2014 it goes with the snow, hand in hand,\" said Wes Heathcock, community services director for the tiny Placer County town that has perhaps one of the most used Interstate 80 on/off ramps in Northern California when it is a snow day. When snow conditions become too treacherous, the California Highway Patrol typically closes\u00a0Interstate 80 at Colfax, as it did Wednesday during a snowstorm that also brought a car-semi collision. Perched at an elevation of 2,400 feet, the official tagline of Colfax is \"above the fog, below the snow.\" The options for stranded travelers are slim in the Old West railroad town, whose most famous mention is a passing reference in Jules Verne's \u201cAround the World in 80 Days.\u201d Even Phileas Fogg did not stop. There is a Starbucks and a single motel. \"They're welcome to spend some tax money in Colfax, but generally you'll see they'll trickle back down, try to locate hotels a little closer to the [Sacramento]\u00a0Valley,\" Heathcock said. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Colfax\u00a0gears up for the die-hards, travelers who believe the solution to snow-blocked passes is to find another route to the same location. \"We all have this wonderful tool called GPS now,\" Heathcock said. From Colfax, California Highway 174 makes a long northerly loop to the narrow, hairpin turns of Highway 20, eventually depositing drivers into the thick. They hit Interstate 80 at Yuba Pass, just before Donner Summit. During Wednesday's storm, the city's public works crew joined the sheriff and California\u00a0Highway Patrol to stand along that road and ward\u00a0off drivers seeking the bypass. Wednesday's storm dropped up to 2\u00a0feet of snow in less than 24 hours in the Tahoe basin, at times coming down at more than 2\u00a0inches an hour. The Sierra Avalanche Center reported a slight improvement in backcountry conditions. The risk of avalanche was lowered to \"considerable\" even as the threat increased of historically large avalanches caused by slabs of snowpack as thick as 8\u00a0feet above a weak layer of ice laid down by a mid-December rain. Near Lake Tahoe on Thursday. two skiers were caught in an avalanche that closed a local highway. But they were not injured, officials said. Sierra residents are preparing for a third onslaught over the weekend, bringing up to 12 inches of rain below 8,500 feet, and more snow above that. A fourth storm system is forecast to roll across Northern California two days after that. After the weekend storm, another rain-making system is expected to hit Northern California on Tuesday. The storm moving through Southern California was significantly smaller than the one in the north. But it still caused problems. Rain-slicked roads were clogged with commuters after a big rig jackknifed on the eastbound 60 Freeway in East Los Angeles, forcing authorities to shut down five lanes. In Burbank, several lanes were blocked after a semi-truck jackknifed across north and southbound lanes of the 5 Freeway.\u00a0 By midmorning, firefighters\u00a0rescued a man who was stranded on\u00a0an island of branches\u00a0and brush\u00a0in the rain-swollen Los Angeles River near Fletcher Drive in Silver Lake, said  Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the\u00a0 Los Angeles Fire Department . Though the rain subsided Thursday afternoon, the problems kept coming. Crews were forced to temporarily close the northbound 710 Freeway north of the 5 Freeway to replace concrete slabs damaged by the weather, the California HIghway Patrol said. For all the problems the storms may cause, it will bring more good news for California\u2019s six-year drought. Officials have said steady rain in Northern California the last few months has filled reservoirs and increased the once-anemic snowpack. They emphasize the storms won\u2019t end the drought . But if the rains keep up for spring, they could make a major dent.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The deadliest fire in a decade has focused new attention on Ghost Ship warehouse owner Chor Ng , Congress is holding its first hearing today on the Russian\u00a0cyberattacks during the presidential election , Aerospace firms are stepping up competition with Silicon Valley for young engineers \u00a0and\u00a0 if Amazon\u2019s Alexa is always listening, can she incriminate you in a crime?

Citizen-Times 5:57 p.m. ET Jan. 5, 2017 x Share Dylann Roof, the convicted Charleston church shooter, said he was psychologically fine in an opening statement during his sentencing trial. USA TODAY NETWORK Dylann Roof is pictured in a self-portrait wearing the flag patches of now-defunct  Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa, states that were linked to white supremacy. (Photo: U.S. District Court of South Carolina) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014\u00a0Dylann Roof, potentially confronted\u00a0with days of testimony from friends and family of the victims he shot in his racially charged massacre at a historically black church, asked the court Thursday to limit the lineup against him. Roof was found guilty last month of killing nine parishioners June 17, 2015, at\u00a0Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church here. In the trial's penalty phase, going on now in U.S. District Court, jurors will decide whether the 22-year-old will be put to death or spend life in prison. He is serving as his own attorney during the sentencing and said he will not offer any defense. After two separate hearings, District Judge Richard Gergel\u00a0proclaimed him competent enough to proceed. \u201cIf I don\u2019t present any mitigation evidence, the victim-impact evidence will take over the whole sentencing trial and guarantee that I get the death penalty,\u201d his first of three motions on the issue stated. \u201cI also think that victim-impact witness should include only relatives \u2014 not friends or co-workers \u2014 of the victims. And that victim impact testimony should be limited to a 'quick glimpse' of the victims\u2019 lives.\u201d The proceeding has taken on the character of a memorial service\u00a0instead of its intended purpose as a sentencing hearing, David Bruck, standby counsel for Roof, said in court. In the meantime,\u00a0Rita Whidbee testified about the kind heart of her best friend, victim Sharonda Coleman-Singleton. \u201cIf I don\u2019t present any mitigation evidence, the victim-impact evidence will take over the whole sentencing trial and guarantee that I get the death penalty.\u201d Dylann Roof motion, Jan. 5, 2017 Coleman-Singleton, 45, was the matron of honor at her wedding,\u00a0delivering a horse-drawn carriage and a fairy-tale day to make her feel like a princess. When Whidbee faced divorce and an uncertain financial future, Coleman-Singleton gave her friend a blank check and told her to fill in the amount she needed. \u201cShe would do anything could do make next person\u2019s life as easy as possible,\u201d Whidbee said. While much of the testimony has illustrated the heart-rending importance of a lost husband, father, wife or mother, some portions have chronicled more routine stretches of life, like childhood memories, favorite foods and nicknames. Gergel has struggled to find the right balance of victim impact testimony. He has upheld the importance of victim impact statements but also has\u00a0urged prosecutors to streamline victim testimony. Gergel warned prosecutors Wednesday that he \u201cwill cut you off at some point if it goes on too long\u201d and added the \u201cdefense raises a legitimate point that at some point it does become too much.\u201d The government removed some witnesses in response to that recommendation, said assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson as the defense again raised the issue Thursday. But he also argued the testimony has been appropriate. \u201cHe is the one that chose to kill nine people,\u201d Richardson said of Roof. \u201cHe chose to go into a church to do it and he chose to do it to particularly good people.\u201d For Roof counsel, a life\u2019s work fighting the death penalty In a second motion regarding the abundance of victim impact statements, Roof, with assistance from his lawyers, argued that his death penalty case is being treated differently than other high-profile federal murder cases. The penalty phase for Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, executed following a death sentence conviction, saw 38 victim impact statements, the same that Charleston prosecutors initially proposed. McVeigh was convicted of killing 168 people. Roof is guilty of nine deaths, the motion states. Roof does not object to the witnesses being heard\u00a0but said their testimony should come at his formal sentencing, when the jury has already made its life-or-death decision. In Roof's self-defense, a constitutional quandary In response to a third motion Roof filed on the matter, one that came Thursday afternoon, Roof asked the court to offer more breaks during emotional proceedings that were bringing jurors, officials and courtroom watchers to tears. Gergel, who offers a morning and an afternoon break in addition to a lunch hour, declined, and chastised much of the motion, one that also raised concerns about video and audio recordings of victims. \u201cThere\u2019s no antiseptic way to do this,\u201d said Gergel, adding that he would be surprised if jurors didn\u2019t become emotional given the loss to families. \u201cI am continually committed to maintain the due process rights of this defendant.\u201d Dylann Roof won't offer defense during sentencing Among the last to testify Thursday was Daniel Simmons Jr., son of the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., who was the only victim that paramedics took from the church. The 74-year-old did not survive. Remembered as the backbone of the church, Simmons was the second person Roof shot, gunned down when he moved forward to help Roof\u2019s first victim, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was shot in prayer. The younger Simmons remembered his father for his love of the church, education and conversation with people who hold different viewpoints, and more lightly, his affinity for a dapper hat. ",

The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) Editorial Board The video depicts a level of cruelty that seems inconceivable. Yet it unfolds before your eyes: A cellphone video, posted for live consumption on Facebook, shows a mentally disabled young man from the suburbs with his mouth taped shut and his wrists bound as four people punch, cut and mock him. The story of this incident rapidly went global \u2014 yet another act of inhumanity in a city that notoriously ended 2016 with 762 homicides. Walk through this slowly: Chicago police say the disabled man met with an acquaintance at a suburban McDonald's on New Year's Eve before being held against his will days later on Chicago's West Side. His parents had reported him missing when he didn't return home. The video broadcast live Tuesday on Facebook shows him tied up in a corner as his captors cut his shirt and slice his scalp. Police say he also was forced to drink toilet water. Four people have been charged with a hate crime in an attack on a man\u00a0with mental disabilities. The attack was recorded on Facebook Live. Police and prosecutors charged four suspects with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Three defendants also are charged with residential burglary and one with robbery and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. As cruel as the behavior depicted on the video is, equally ghastly is the sound track \u2014 punctuated by laughter. The woman shooting the video belly laughs as one of the offenders slices a chunk of hair from the young man's scalp, bloodying him. \"Let me see ... ooooh,\" she cackles, getting a closer shot of the victim's head. The trappings of a party surround the scene. Police say it appeared at least one of the suspects was smoking marijuana. Bottles of booze are captured on the tape. The behavior is nothing short of monstrous. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson called the acts on the video \"reprehensible\" and racist. At one point, the offenders lash out against \"white people\" and Donald Trump. All the while, the victim sits in a corner, defenseless. He was able to get away when his captors confronted a downstairs neighbor and the neighbor called police. On Tuesday evening, police found him wandering in the Homan Square neighborhood, disoriented, injured and wearing shorts in the cold weather. They called an ambulance. They learned he had been reported \"missing and endangered\" in suburban Crystal Lake. Scene of Facebook Live attack Police say an apartment on Chicago's West Side was the scene of a brutal attack captured on Facebook Live that led to hate crime charges being filed against four people. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) Police say an apartment on Chicago's West Side was the scene of a brutal attack captured on Facebook Live that led to hate crime charges being filed against four people. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) See more videos We leave questions of guilt or innocence to the courts. But any offenders convicted of these crimes likely will face stiff consequences for their actions, which police initially characterized as \"stupid\" prank-type behavior. Right. Just a bunch of kids goofing around. Police toughened their narrative by the time charges were filed Thursday, as they should have. For Chicago, then, another grim moment. It's become all too routine. We have the data to prove it. Join the discussion on Twitter @ Trib_Ed_Board \u00a0and on\u00a0 Facebook . Facebook live torture ",

By Philip Rucker January 5 at 7:24 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Former CIA director R. James Woolsey Jr., a veteran of four presidential administrations and one of the nation\u2019s leading intelligence experts, resigned Thursday from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team because of growing tensions over Trump\u2019s vision for intelligence agencies. Woolsey\u2019s resignation as a Trump senior adviser comes amid frustrations over the incoming administration\u2019s national security plans and Trump\u2019s public comments undermining the intelligence community. \u201cEffective immediately, Ambassador Woolsey is no longer a Senior Advisor to President-Elect Trump or the Transition. He wishes the President-Elect and his Administration great success in their time in office,\u201d Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey, said in a statement. Woolsey said on CNN Thursday night that he did not want to \u201cfly under false colors\u201d any longer. \u201cI\u2019ve been an adviser and felt that I was making a contribution\u2026.. But I\u2019m not really functioning as an adviser anymore. When I\u2019m on the [television] screen, everybody announces that I\u2019m a former CIA director and that I\u2019m a Trump adviser and I\u2019m really not anymore.\u201d People close to Woolsey said that he had been excluded in recent weeks from discussions on intelligence matters with Trump and retired Lt. Gen.\u00a0Michael Flynn, the incoming White House national security adviser. They said that Woolsey had grown increasingly uncomfortable lending his name and credibility to the transition team without being consulted. Woolsey was taken aback by this week\u2019s reports that Trump is considering revamping the country\u2019s intelligence framework, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk\u00a0candidly. \u201cJim is very uncomfortable being considered an adviser in an area where one might consider him an expert when he is not involved in the discussions,\u201d one person close to Woolsey said. \u201cTo be called \u2018senior adviser\u2019 and your opinion is not sought is something he cannot handle.\u201d Trump transition officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Woolsey\u2019s resignation. Woolsey has been a key player in the national security firmament since the late 1970s, when he served as undersecretary of the Navy in the Jimmy Carter administration. He has held other roles under former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, culminating with the post as director of the CIA between 1993 and 1995. The person close to Woolsey described him as having chafed at Trump\u2019s loose style on Twitter. They described Woolsey as a \u201cvery principled\u201d diplomat who takes care to communicate the right message with just the right words. \u201cThis is a guy [for whom] commas, periods, etc., all have special meaning,\u201d this person said. Woolsey joined the Trump campaign last September, issuing a statement commending Trump\u2019s plans to grow and modernize the military. \u201cMr. Trump understands the magnitude of the threats we face,\u201d he said in the statement. powerpost ",

CBS Atlanta affiliate WGCL Some groups taking part in the inaugural parade January 20 are seeing members decline to participate -- or even resign over their organization's ... Talladega College President Billy Hawkins confirmed what the Presidential Inaugural Committee had announced Dec. 30. It was the first official word from the school.\u00a0 The Inaugural Committee\u2019s announcement last month had ignited passionate debate on the campus and around the nation.\u00a0 In announcing that the Talladega College Marching Tornadoes will participate, Hawkins said the lessons students can learn from the experience cannot be taught in a classroom. \u201cWe respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade,\u201d Hawkins said in a statement Thursday. \u201cAs many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said, we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power,\u201d Hawkins added. The announcement followed several days of intense debate on social media, with some people voicing strong opposition. \u201cShame on #talladegacollege,\u201d one user wrote, echoing other comments critical of the decision. Shame on #talladegacollege ! Do not sell your souls! I hope there are protests and discussions underway on campus to stop this outrage. \u2014 Marilyn Richardson (@MarilynElaine) January 2, 2017 I cannot even with #Talledegacollege ... Y'all really gonna shuck & jive down Pennsylvania Ave for Trump?! Where are the alumni? #Nah \u2014 Shug Avery (@UppityBlkWoman) January 3, 2017 A petition that now has more than 1,800 supporters was also created on change.org asking that the band withdraw,\u00a0 CBS Atlanta affiliate WGCL reported .\u00a0 \u201cAs an alumnus I respectfully request that Talladega College Band withdraw from any inaugural events for Donald Trump,\u201d wrote a woman identifying herself as Shirley Pratt Ferrill, the creator of the petition. \u201cIn view of his behavior and comments I strongly do not want Talladega College to give the appearance of supporting him.\u201d \u00a0 Others, however, said the chance to perform is a good opportunity. \u201cFor one, it would bring like a positive at least \u2018cause people will at least know about the school,\u201d said Joshua Eleby, a Talladega College senior.\u00a0 Others echoed that sentiment on social media. Do you know how many ppl have never heard of Talledega College until now? Admissions offices need to be recruiting off that alone. \u2014 #BlackLivesMatter (@AnthonyMartrell) January 3, 2017 Talladega bills itself as Alabama\u2019s oldest private, historically black liberal arts college. It traces its beginnings to 1865, when two former slaves pledged to provide a school for the children of former slaves of the community. The school was founded two years later, in 1867, according to historical accounts on its website.\u00a0 Talladega will join about a half-dozen other college bands, at least eight high school bands and several military groups that have been announced for the parade lineup so far. The decision to march in Trump\u2019s inaugural parade has also sparked controversy at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York. The band will be marching, but some of its members will be staying home, school spokesman Greg Cannon said earlier this week. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have anything to do with the inauguration or President Trump and we respect that, and that\u2019s their right,\u201d Cannon said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

USA Today Network Mary Bowerman , USA TODAY Network 5:27 p.m. ET Jan. 5, 2017 Yo Quiero Taco Bell. (Photo: Matt Marton, AP) Taco Bell, the home of a Doritos-wrapped taco, could actually help you keep your New Year\u2019s resolution to eat healthier when you dine out this year. The fast-food chain has made a series of changes over the years, from eliminating artificial flavors and trans fat to the low-calorie \u2018Fresco\ufffd? menu and reducing sodium across the menu by 15% since 2008. The chain now plans to \u00a0eliminate\u00a0XL sodas, cut an additional 10% of sodium across the menu,\u00a0and remove some antibiotics from its chicken by early 2017.\u00a0 With vegetarian and high protein menu options in addition to the late-night fan favorites, the taco haven has slowly pushed itself to become the healthier option among the fast food giants. Angie Murad, a registered dietician nutritionist, said one of the biggest road blocks to eating healthfully at fast food and traditional restaurants is the sky-high levels of sodium. \u201cThey are trying to decrease the amount of sodium which is great because usually when you do eat out, the menu options are higher in sodium,\ufffd? she said. Starbucks may soon be bigger than McDonald's Murad said typically meals at fast food restaurants and sit-down establishments have an emphasis on carbs and fats, instead of using fruits and vegetables as the basis of the meals. Restaurants typically up fat and sodium, says Murad. \u201cOur taste is kind of centered on that \u2014\u00a0it enhances the flavor,\ufffd? she said. But while FoodBeast \u00a0and others have praised Taco Bell for its subtle transition to more healthful options in the past, the driving motive behind the changes isn\u2019t so positive, according to Yoni Freedhoff, assistant professor family medicine University of Ottawa and author of Weighty Matters. \u201cThe industry\u2019s job is to sell food, so this move is not about protecting American health of Americans... they are hoping this will improve sales,\ufffd? he said. \u00a0\u201cThere is no reason to make changes for industry, industry doesn\u2019t have the luxury of following a moral compass. It\u2019s about making profits.\ufffd? Wendy\u2019s is cold on Twitter, some might even say frosty Whatever Taco Bell\u2019s motives, Murad said for people who are eating out, planning is essential to ensuring they maintain healthy options. \u201cSince there is the nutrition information online you can use some tricks to find healthier options if you are in a bind and have to eat our or go to fast food,\ufffd? she said.

(Photo: Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sport) Oklahoma redshirt sophomore running back Joe Mixon\u00a0has declared for the NFL draft, The Oklahoman \u00a0and ESPN report. Mixon, who finished the 2016 season with 1,274 rushing yards\u00a0and 538 receiving yards, was mum on his future following the Sooners' Sugar Bowl victory against Auburn. Mixon has faced significant scrutiny after video of him striking a woman in 2014 was released in December. Mixon was captured on videotape punching a woman in a deli in Norman, Okla., breaking the woman's\u00a0jaw, eye socket and cheekbone.\u00a0He issued a formal apology last month, and suggested that racial slurs sparked\u00a0his actions. Oklahoma's Joe Mixon tearfully apologizes for punching woman Mixon was\u00a0suspended one game by coach\u00a0Bob Stoops\u00a0after he allegedly ripped up a parking ticket and threw it at the attendant.\u00a0University of Oklahoma press secretary Corbin Wallace\u00a0 told TMZ on Thursday \u00a0that the \"incident has been closed from OUPD,\" and that the case was turned over to the Cleveland County district attorney, who declined to press charges. Mixon's decision\u00a0comes on the heels of\u00a0junior running back Samaje Perine announced his intent to enter the NFL draft. Heisman candidate quarterback Baker Mayfield is returning for 2017.

A federal report said Thursday natural gas production is on track to make the U.S. a net exporter of energy by about 2030. Ralph Wilson/AP hide caption toggle caption Ralph Wilson/AP Workers move equipment at a natural gas well site near Burlington, Pa., in 2010. A federal report said Thursday natural gas production is on track to make the U.S. a net exporter of energy by about 2030. Ralph Wilson/AP The U.S. could become a net exporter of energy in coming years, according to the federal government's Annual Energy Outlook 2017. This continues a trend the Energy Information Administration has highlighted before in its annual report. The EIA projects the country will continue to import oil through 2050, though at much lower levels than in the past. The main thing that will make the U.S. a net exporter of energy is natural gas. Domestic natural gas production has risen by nearly 30 percent over the past decade, primarily because controversial technologies such as hydraulic fracturing have opened up new fields to drilling. Now companies are proposing and building natural gas export facilities around the country with the production boom expected to continue. The EIA is quick to warn that there is a lot of uncertainty in projections like this. That's why each year the agency considers a variety of factors and then develops multiple scenarios. It looks at things like production, demand, prices and technological advancements. Most of the agency's seven scenarios show the country becoming a net exporter by 2030. One scenario, in which crude oil prices rise sharply, projects the country would become a net energy exporter within just a few years. That's unlikely to happen, though. The agency believes Brent crude oil prices this year will average around $51.66 a barrel \u2014 about half of what a barrel sold for in 2014. Article continues after sponsorship As part of its annual report the EIA also has projections for energy-related carbon emissions. EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski says emission levels will depend a lot on what happens with the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan , which is tied up in the courts now . Considering President-elect Donald Trump's stated desire to boost the coal industry, he could choose to stop defending the plan . \"We see the highest emissions without the Clean Power Plan because we'll continue to use more coal, and coal has more carbon dioxide than the other fossil fuels,\" says Sieminski. The report shows Americans are using energy more efficiently, and the agency projects that will continue. Despite a growing population and a growing economy, consumption is expected to be relatively flat through 2050. The EIA believes gasoline will remain the dominant fuel for transportation in the U.S. for decades. Still, the number of electric vehicles is expected to increase from 1 percent of the cars on the road today to 6 percent in 2040. That may not seem fast enough growth if you're an electric-car advocate, but consider that there are about 250 million cars in the U.S. now. Sieminski says, \"There's a lot of gasoline and diesel-powered cars on the road that are not going to be retired immediately.\" The fact that natural gas is replacing coal for electricity generation has been widely reported. The EIA data show more power comes from gas than coal now. And the agency projects that renewable forms of electricity, such as wind and solar, could overtake coal by 2030. ",

    "text": "Democrats Call For Ethics Investigation Into Trump Nominee Stock Trading By BENJAMIN SIEGEL Jan 5, 2017, 7:31 PM ET 0 Shares Star Joshua Roberts/Reuters Chairman of the House Budget Committee Tom Price announces the House Budget during a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 17, 2015. 0 Shares Email Top Senate Democrats are calling on the House Office of Congressional Ethics and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Georgia Rep. Tom Price's trading activity on health-related stocks while serving in Congress and working on health care issues. According to a Wall Street Journal report in December, Price, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and President-elect Donald Trump 's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, bought and sold stock in about 40 health care and biomedical companies in the last four years. He also sponsored a number of health-related bills during that time. On Wednesday, consumer advocacy group Public Citizen sent a letter to the OCE and the SEC requesting an investigation of whether Price's trading violated the STOCK Act passed by Congress in 2012, meant to prevent members of Congress from trading on information not available to the public. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, the new Senate Democratic leader, said Price \"didn't simply vote on health care bills\" but \"championed them,\" and said his access to health care information as a member of the Budget and the Ways and Means Committees was \"second to none.\" Schumer stopped short of saying Price violated the STOCK Act. \"We don't know if he broke the law, but there certainly [are] enough serious questions to warrant a serious investigation before any hearing is held on Congressman Price to become secretary of HHS,\" Schumer said. \"This is serious stuff. And that's why we need full hearings with plenty of questions and full disclosure.\" Democrats have not put forward any evidence that Price acted in an illegal manner. Both the OCE and SEC declined to comment on the letter sent by Public Citizen. (The OCE is only permitted to investigate current members of Congress, so if Price is confirmed it would have to drop any ongoing investigation.) House Republicans targeted the OCE earlier this week. The conference tried to vote on a measure to limit the watchdog's independence and ended up scuttling the vote after pushback from constituents and President-elect Trump. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, whose Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is responsible for reviewing the HHS nominee, has met with Price, but wouldn't divulge any conversation about his trading activity. Murray said Democrats want to know whether the transactions reviewed by the Wall Street Journal and Public Citizen were initiated by Price or a broker, what nonpublic information he had when the trades were made and how much he profited from his transactions since 2012. Speaking on the Senate floor today, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, accused Democrats of politicizing the nomination process. The Senate Finance Committee formally handles the HHS secretary confirmation. \"By all accounts, the Finance Committee\u2019s longstanding vetting process is exceptionally thorough and fair. And, it is deeply regrettable that some of our colleagues would try to undermine that process and not provide the incoming Trump Administration\u2019s nominees the same respect and regard that our committee provided for nominees in the Obama Administration,\" he said. The committee has received three years of tax returns and a completed questionnaire, and is the midst of its vetting process. The panel has not yet received final financial disclosures from the Office of Government Ethics. \"If you're not a public official, making a smart investment is just that,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \"If you are a public official, however, at a minimum you have to be sensitive to appearances of conflicts of interests.\" The Senate HELP panel traditionally holds courtesy hearings for HHS secretary nominees. An aide to Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, the committee's chairman, says Price is expected to testify before lawmakers on Jan. 18. Phil Blando, a Trump transition spokesman, called Democrats' calls for an investigation a \"stunt.\" \"The reality is that Dr. Price\u2019s 20-year career as an orthopedic surgeon and a fiscal conservative make him uniquely qualified to lead HHS. Today\u2019s stunt is simply an effort to deflect attention away from ObamaCare\u2019s dismal record, including reduced choices and $700 billion in Medicare cuts,\" he said in a statement. Price is one of the eight Trump Cabinet nominees Senate Democrats are targeting for more thorough background information. They could slow down the confirmation process if more details aren't provided, according to a senior Democratic aide. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "The U.S. Capitol in Washington is pictured on Oct. 31, 2016. 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump this morning announced his picks for three of the most prestigious jobs in the executive branch \u2014 Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Rep. Mike Pompeo as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. Two of those jobs require a check from the legislative branch, a Senate confirmation vote. Here's how the process works: Who Needs Senate Confirmation? All Cabinet-level officials , except the White House chief of staff, require Senate confirmation, including: the secretaries of agriculture, commerce, defense, education, energy, health and human services, homeland security , housing and urban development, interior, labor, state, transportation, treasury, and veterans affairs, as well as the attorney general, director of the Office of Management and Budget , administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. trade representative, ambassador to the United Nations , chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and administrator of the Small Business Administration. Hundreds of other senior posts and agency heads (1,212, to be exact) require Senate confirmation too after background checks. Essentially, heads of agencies and a lot of deputies need to be confirmed, whereas adviser positions for the president do not. For example: CIA director, yes; national security adviser, no. The level of Senate confirmations has created a backlog in committees on Capitol Hill and left agencies understaffed. The Washington Post reported in 2013 that when Janet Napolitano resigned as secretary of homeland security, there were 15 vacant leadership positions in that department. When Does the President Send Appointments to the Hill? Before a nomination may move to the Hill, the candidate must submit several forms and undergo a fair amount of vetting by the White House and FBI. What is gathered in this process (by looking at, for example, financial disclosure reports, criminal checks and questionnaires about ties to foreign governments) could be used by the president or president\u2013elect to withdraw a nomination or present it to the Senate as evidence in hearings. In 2004, Congress passed legislation to \"encourage a president-elect to submit, for security clearance, potential nominees to high-level national security positions as soon as possible after the election,\" according to the Congressional Research Service. The goal was to \"reduce the elapsed time between a new president's inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team.\" What Does the Confirmation Process Look Like? 1) A nomination is given to the relevant Senate committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee, for example, handles the attorney general nomination. 2) That committee can then hold hearings, vote to move the nomination straight to the Senate floor for a vote or not move on it at all (in which case, the committee effectually kills the nomination). 3) After hearings, the committee votes to report a nomination to the full Senate, requiring a simple majority. It may vote to report the nomination favorably, unfavorably or without recommendation. If a committee sits on an appointment, the full Senate may vote to invoke cloture and move the nomination along. 4) If a nomination clears committee, it moves to the Senate floor for a simple majority vote. Filibusters are not an issue here because Democrats changed Senate rules three years ago to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for most nominations. Supreme Court picks are still subject to filibuster. Will Trump Have the Votes? The GOP barely kept its majority in the Senate after this year's elections, and rejections of major appointments are rare. Republicans have 51 seats right now and will likely have 52 by January. (Louisiana's race is in a runoff, and ABC News' race rating is solid Republican.) But that number includes Sessions, who was just announced as Trump's pick for attorney general. That raises some questions. Will Sessions vote for himself? When John Kerry was in the Senate and required confirmation as secretary of state, he voted \"present.\" Could some Republicans defect? Yup. Could there be a tie? Maybe. Would Republicans need to use soon-to-be Vice President Mike Pence's vote as a tie breaker? Possibly. When Do Hearings Start? Hearings can and will likely start pretty soon after the 115th Congress is sworn in Jan. 3, 2017. The hearing and legislative schedules have not been set yet. A nominee may not be confirmed, however, until after the president is sworn in on Jan. 20. Fun Fact The first time the Senate rejected a nomination was on Aug. 5, 1789: Benjamin Fishbourn as the naval officer for the Port of Savannah. 0 Shares ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Kelsey Snell and David Weigel January 5 at 6:35 PM Follow @kelsey_snell Follow daveweigel Some of the most conservative members of Congress say they are ready to vote for a budget that would \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 balloon the deficit to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, all for the sake of eventually repealing the Affordable Care Act. In a dramatic reversal, many members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus said Thursday they are prepared later this month to support a budget measure that would explode the deficit and increase the public debt to more than $29.1 trillion by 2026, figures contained in the budget resolution itself. As they left a meeting with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Thursday, some of the conservatives said that spending targets contained in the budget for fiscal year 2017 are symbolic. The real goal of the budget legislation, they argued, is to establish an opportunity to finally make good on GOP promises to repeal President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. \u201cI just came to understand all the different ideas about where we go next,\u201d said Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), a member of the House Freedom Caucus that typically opposes massive spending increases. Schweikert now says he will probably vote for the budget resolution. The growing conservative consensus comes nearly one year after the approximately 40-member group announced it would rather torpedo the entire budget process than vote for a fiscal blueprint that increased spending without balancing the budget. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) [ House conservatives are having a family conversation on the budget ] But fiscal discipline now seems to be taking a back seat to the drive to repeal Obamacare. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a replacement on Obamacare pretty quick,\u201d said Rep. Brian Babin (R-Tex.). \u201cWould I like to see [the budget] balance? Certainly. Absolutely. I\u2019ve got 13 grandchildren, and I don\u2019t want to see them buried under $30 trillion of debt.\u201d The Freedom Caucus has not taken an official position on the budget \u2014 80 percent of them need to agree to do so \u2014 but many members said the dramatic spending created in the 2017 budget measure were only technicalities. They contend that voters understand some sacrifices need to be made to gut the health-care law. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters that the group will decide Monday on an official position on the budget. \u201cThe real question is: Does it change the top line number on what we\u2019re spending?\u201d Meadows said. \u201cDoes it increase spending \u2014 or does it become a vehicle that maintains our current spending levels and allows us to repeal\u201d the Affordable Care Act? Others Republicans, including Paul, still question whether it is ever acceptable to support deficit increases, no matter how symbolic. Paul described Thursday\u2019s meeting, which attracted 23 Freedom Caucus members and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), as a first step. File photo: A small group of demonstrators stand outside of of a hotel before former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint speaks at a \"Defund Obamacare Tour\" rally in Indianapolis, Indiana. (Nathan Chute /Reuters) \u201cI wanted to make sure that conservatives in the House knew that, together, we can have impact and influence on what the budget will be,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI heard one person say that, well, we\u2019ll vote for this now, but we won\u2019t in four months. My point is that the Republican leadership will come back and say, \u2018You already voted for it once; why not vote for it a second time?\u2019 \u201d Many in the conservative clique emerged ambivalent about Paul\u2019s argument. \u201cI\u2019m not staking out a position on the budget just yet,\u201d Babin said after the meeting. Mainstream Republicans are urging their typically implacable conservative colleagues to turn a blind eye to the spending numbers for now. Republican leaders are using a complicated quirk of the budget process to repeal Obamacare without the threat of a blockade by Senate Democrats. Budget legislation is considered under special rules in the Senate that allow a simple majority of 50 senators rather than the normal 60 needed for almost everything else. There are 52 Republicans in the Senate this year, and there is virtually no hope that any Democrat would agree to dismantle Obama\u2019s health-care law. The budget introduced this week in the Senate includes instructions for committees to begin repealing the ACA. GOP leaders want Republicans to focus on language requiring members of four committees to produce bills seven days after Trump\u2019s inauguration that each would save $1 billion over a decade by slashing ACA elements. Not all conservatives are convinced. Paul is joined by deficit hawks like Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) who worry their voters won\u2019t countenance even a seemingly meaningless vote to increase the deficit. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do a symbolic budget resolution, why not put in a good number?\u201d Brat asked Thursday. \u201cPeople are very cynical, and I need a message so I can go back home with a straight face.\u201d The collective shrug from other conservatives is the latest evidence that Paul\u2019s protest would be a familiar, lonely one. His floor speech attacking the budget measure for making no attempts at deficit reduction \u2014 it projects a $9 trillion increase in the debt by 2026 \u2014 was preempted by statements from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), pledging to vote for the resolution anyway. That position has made Paul one of very few Republicans still talking about the debt as a national crisis worth building legislation around. During his presidential campaign, which ended after the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Paul made a number of attempts to draw attention to the national debt and to promote his annual plans to balance the budget with steep spending cuts. Months later, most of the Freedom Caucus \u2014 17 members \u2014 voted against the GOP\u2019s 2016 budget on debt-reduction grounds. The new budget resolution makes even fewer concessions on debt reduction. For Republicans who frequently described the debt as a threat to their children\u2019s futures, it\u2019s a difficult sell. \u201cWe want to keep in mind the overall picture, both the deficit and how tired people are Obamacare,\u201d said Rep. Randy Weber (R-Tex.). \u201cI do think there\u2019s a danger of the Republicans actually owning this.\u201d ",

Jones , USA TODAY 3:06 p.m. ET Jan. 5, 2017 31 Shares Please stop asking Anna Kendrick about this subject. \u00a0(Photo: Alberto E. Rodriguez, Getty Images) Stars unabashedly addressed Hollywood\u2019s woman problem in 2016, but in the new year, Anna Kendrick wants to hear new voices. The actress and Scrappy Little Nobody author\u00a0covers Glamour's February 2017 issue and speaks candidly about the limits of the current dialogue surrounding sexism, which has largely homed in on how it manifests in Tinseltown . \"It shouldn\u2019t be the most important conversation about sexism \u2013 because no one really wants to (expletive) hear actors talk about this\u00a0because we\u2019re in such positions of privilege,\" Kendrick says. \"I would love to hear more about sexism that exists in other fields and how we can address that, but we keep getting asked about it.\" But Kendrick maintains that she would rather amplify more established authorities, especially as she continues to learn and mold her own ideological beliefs. \"It\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it, because I feel like why would anybody want my \u2018expert opinion\u2019 on any of these topics?\" she says. \"If you want to learn about intersectional feminism, read Roxane Gay. Don\u2019t ask me, you know? I\u2019m being asked to speak on these things when I\u2019m trying to learn about them myself.\" ",

USA TODAY Here are the key things we learned from Thursday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Russian cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election. 1.\u00a0More than one\u00a0motive Top intelligence officials reiterated their belief that the Russians hacked Hillary Clinton's campaign and other political party groups in an attempt to influence the presidential election and help President-elect Donald Trump win. However, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said there was actually \"more than one motive.\" He said multiple motives will be detailed in a comprehensive report to be made public next week. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper listens while testifying on Capitol Hill on Jan. 5, 2017, before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. \u00a0(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) 2.\u00a0Trump still won Clapper said the Russian cyber attacks\u00a0\"did not change any vote tallies or anything\u00a0of that sort.\" However, he added that there is no way to gauge the impact of the hacking and the subsequent leak of information from Clinton's campaign on how Americans voted. He said the report to be released next week will not question the outcome or legitimacy of the election results. 3.\u00a0No need for name-calling The president-elect's dismissive comments about the intelligence community and its assessment that the Russians tried to influence the election were repeatedly brought up by both Democratic and some Republican senators, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Clapper said the comments are not helping the morale of agents at the CIA, FBI and other intelligence agencies. He said he encourages elected officials to maintain a \"healthy skepticism\" about intelligence reports\u00a0but added that \"there is a difference between skepticism and disparagement.\" President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 28, 2016, in Palm Beach, Fla. \u00a0(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) 4.\u00a0Russians did more than hack\u00a0 Clapper said Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential campaign was \"a multi-faceted campaign\" that also included the dissemination of \"fake news\" and propaganda. \"The hacking was only one part of it,\" he said. He added that the fake news and other disinformation efforts are continuing. 5.\u00a0This is going to take a while Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said he will continue to hold a series of hearings in the months ahead to try to develop a policy on how to best deter cyberattacks. McCain said basic questions must still be answered as part of that effort. Among them: what constitutes an act of war or aggression in cyberspace that would merit a military response, either a cyber counterattack or other action; who is accountable for this problem, and do they have sufficient power to deliver results; and does Congress need to change how its committees are organized to help find solutions? McCain has said he plans to create a new cyber subcommittee as part of the Armed Services panel. Republican congressional leaders have so far rejected calls for the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Russian hacks. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., arrives for the panel's hearing on foreign cyber threats. \u00a0(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) ",

But that never happened for Hartman or her sister, Trisha Baker. They two were on their way from Orlando to Asheville, North Carolina, Monday to visit their sick father, who was in hospice care. While the plane was waiting to leave the tarmac, Hartman\u2019s sister got a text message saying their father only had hours to live. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if my sister was getting the same text and (I) was I thinking, \u2018I need to go back and tell her,\u201d\u2019 Baker recalled. Baker said when she got up to tell her sister, a flight attendant stepped in. \u201cShe said, \u2018You need to sit down,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Well, can I just sit here? I just want to console my sister. We just got word that my dad\u2019s dying,\u2019\u201d Baker said. Hartman said she started having a panic attack and the situation only escalated from there, when Baker confronted the flight attendant for not being compassionate. \u201cShe said, \u2018You\u2019re being very rude. My father is dying and I\u2019m comforting her\u2019 -- and they said she needed to keep her personal problems off the plane,\u201d Hartman said. Minutes later, the sisters said, the flight attendant called the captain, the plane turned around and airport security escorted them off the flight. \u201cThey told us we were a threat to the flight. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cPeople were like \u2018what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Hartman added. Some passengers even took to YouTube and complained about the situation. \u201cThat was the most inhumane, deplorable thing I\u2019ve ever seen any human being do,\u201d one woman said. Hartman said their father died shortly after -- and now she wants the airline to be held accountable. \u201cI would like to see them in some way be punished in a way where people understand. This is not humane. One hundred thousand percent I blame them. They were the gate between keeping me from my father to say goodbye,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they should keep their jobs, to be honest with you,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have heart. They didn\u2019t care that I wasn\u2019t going to [get to] see my dad.\u201d WKMG emailed Allegiant Air, and the carrier said it\u2019s investigating. The airline released a statement saying, \u201cAt Allegiant we rely on our crew members to provide and oversee a safe environment for every passenger, on every flight. We expect that authority to be exercised both judiciously and consistently, with empathy and with good judgment. We take this customer feedback seriously and are in the process of conducting an investigation into what occurred. \u201c \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

They will serve as a rifleman, machine gunner and mortar Marine, said 1st Lt. John McCombs, spokesman for the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejuene. They report Thursday to the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, which has had three female officers in its ranks for several months to help integrate the enlisted females into the unit, McCombs said. The women's names and ranks were not released. \"This process ensures the Marine Corps will adhere to its standards and will continue its emphasis on combat readiness,\" McCombs said in an email. Their entry in the unit marks ongoing efforts to comply with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's directive in December 2015 to open all military jobs to women, including the most dangerous commando posts. That decision was formal recognition of the thousands of female servicewomen who fought in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in recent years, including those who were killed or wounded. Carter's decision also stood as a rebuff to the Marine Corps, which was the only service branch to ask for an exception to women serving in certain infantry and combat slots. The Army, Navy, Air Force and Special Operations Command all said they would not seek any exceptions and would recommend removing the ban on women in dangerous combat jobs. In June, six months after Carter's move, The Associated Press reported the Marine Corps had seven female officers either serving in combat posts or waiting in line to serve, and 167 women with noncombat jobs in front-line units. There are about 40,000 Marines in the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force. 0 Shares ",

Claressa Dupree, left, with her 16-year-old daughter Selah Washington, recalls the shootout between Pomona police officers and a man who lived across from her apartment in Pomona. The man was killed, officials said. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Alene Tchekmedyian , Veronica Rocha and Matt Hamilton Contact Reporters Henry Washington was playing football outside his Pomona apartment complex when he heard two loud booms Wednesday evening.\u00a0 The 15-year-old then saw kids bolting from\u00a0a nearby apartment unit, followed by the\u00a0property manager\u2019s boyfriend, who was\u00a0stumbling and bleeding from his back. A neighbor then stepped outside, a cigarette in one hand, a gun\u00a0in the other. \"It was crazy,\" Washington\u00a0said. \"First I see the gun, then he started to raise it and that's when we ran.\"\u00a0 Just hours after Pomona police officers fatally shot a gunman\u00a0in their apartment complex, residents said they were at a loss Thursday to explain the violence, and could only guess what had driven a quiet and withdrawn neighbor to fire on their property manager and her boyfriend.\u00a0 \u201cHe just kept to himself, really quiet, wouldn\u2019t say anything to anybody,\u201d Claressa Dupree said of the shooter, who has not been publicly identified by police. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you how his voice really sounded.\u201d The incident, which is now under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department,\u00a0occurred about 7 p.m. in the 900 block of North San Antonio Avenue, when a gunman entered an apartment and shot a man in the chest, and the man\u2019s girlfriend in the chest and stomach, according to authorities.\u00a0The victims\u00a0were both taken to a hospital and listed in fair condition Thursday. The gunman was shot and killed by Pomona police. A group of children who were in the property\u00a0manager\u2019s apartment witnessed a harrowing scene there, a next-door neighbor said. Eyewitness to shooting in Pomona Claressa Dupree describes the shooting that occurred at a Pomona apartment complex. Claressa Dupree describes the shooting that occurred at a Pomona apartment complex. See more videos The neighbor, Monica Diaz, said her\u00a011-year-old son and her two grandchildren were sitting at a table eating when there was a knock at the door. It was the gunman, who walked in and began arguing with the building manager\u2019s boyfriend in a bedroom, Diaz said. The children, Diaz said, heard hollering coming from the room, then a gunshot.\u00a0 The gunman then came into the kitchen and shot the property manager twice in the leg \u2014\u00a0near her ankle and near her knee \u2014 while she held her 3-year-old foster son, Diaz said.\u00a0 Diaz\u2019s 11-year-old son ran next door, screaming.\u00a0 \u201dMommy, there\u2019s a man in the house shooting at everyone!\u201d Diaz, 45, recalled him saying.\u00a0 Diaz and her boyfriend ran over and found the property manager on the floor, screaming and bleeding. Diaz found three of the woman\u2019s five foster children hiding throughout the apartment. As she ushered\u00a0the children into her own home, she saw the gunman outside, firing rounds as he faced her. Two bullets struck a house across the street, she said.\u00a0\u00a0 Washington, who had been playing football outside,\u00a0told a reporter from The Times that once he the man holding a gun, he ran to tell Dupree, his mother. Dupree, 43, said she peeked through the blinds and saw the gunman come around the corner, raise his gun and fire two shots toward a second-floor unit, shattering a window. \u201cI just see him -- pow \u2013 I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh shoot, that\u2019s a real gun,\u2019\u201d Dupree said. The gunfire continued as Dupree dashed to her phone and dialed 911 before directing her own three kids and their friend to hide under or by the beds in their two bedrooms. \u201cI said, \u2018If he makes it through the door, I don\u2019t want him shooting fish in a barrel,\u2019 so I split them up,\u201d she said. She was lying on the floor, on the phone with a dispatcher, when she heard sirens blaring. \u201cShe said, \u2018Just stay down just stay down,\u2019\u201d Dupree said Another resident, Moises Santamaria, 41, said his 14-year-old son was walking to the laundry room when the teen encountered the gunman in a common area after he\u2019d shot out the windows. \u201cCarry on,\u201d the shooter said, with his gun by his side, according to Santamaria. As the teen walked to the laundry room, Santamaria came outside, where he saw the shooter fire another round into the air. The man made eye contact with Santamaria before turning around and walking toward the alley. \u201cHe looked kind of mad at the time, like something was bugging him,\u201d Santamaria said.\u00a0 Santamaria called out to his son, calmly asking him to come back inside.\u00a0 \u201cI kind of feel like he had a target, because I think anyone was up for grabs at that point and no one else got shot,\u201d Santamaria said.\u00a0 Once Pomona police arrived, officers spotted the gunman\u00a0walking in the area of Columbia and San Antonio avenues, according to Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Lisa Jansen.\u00a0 Police fired at the man, and he ran into the\u00a0alley at the rear of the apartment complex.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the man who was shot in the torso pounded on doors, pleading for help, before collapsing on the grass, according to Diaz.\u00a0 According to the Sheriff\u2019s Department, the man engaged in a shootout with Pomona officers and was struck by gunfire. At least three officers fired their weapons. The man was pronounced dead at the scene, Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez said.\u00a0 A handgun was recovered at the scene, authorities said.\u00a0 Neighbors told KCAL-TV that it appeared the suspect, a resident of the apartment complex, opened fire while being evicted.\u00a0 But other neighbors told The Times on Thursday morning that they believed the shooting stemmed from a family dispute, not an eviction.\u00a0 Dupree said the shooter was a relative of the property manager who was already living in the complex when Dupree moved in three years ago. Neighbors said he couldn\u2019t stand loud noises, and complained\u00a0when tenants played loud music. When there was construction going on at the complex for about a week last year, he stayed elsewhere. In the two years Santamaria has lived in the complex, he said, he had only seen his neighbor, the shooter, only three times. In one of those encounters, the man was upset after a soccer ball struck his front door.\u00a0 Diaz said that since the shooting, her young son has been repeatedly vomiting and has not been able to sleep.\u00a0 He told her, \u201cEvery time I close my eyes, I see everything happening all over again,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cI want to move now,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The deadliest fire in a decade has focused new attention on Ghost Ship warehouse owner Chor Ng , Congress is holding its first hearing today on the Russian\u00a0cyberattacks during the presidential election , Aerospace firms are stepping up competition with Silicon Valley for young engineers \u00a0and\u00a0 if Amazon\u2019s Alexa is always listening, can she incriminate you in a crime?

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation\u2019s biennial State of the Bay report gave the estuary a C-minus grade, an improvement from a D-plus two years ago and the highest score issued since the inception of the report in 1998. Still, the report notes that the bay - an economic driver that supports fishing, farming, shipping and tourism - remains \u201ca system dangerously out of balance, a system in crisis,\u201d and says progress has been uneven across the region. The Chesapeake Bay watershed spans 64,000 square miles in parts of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Nature: Chesapeake Bay \u201cThe bay is getting better,\u201d foundation President William Baker said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cThis is good news, but the recovery is fragile. There\u2019s a long way left to go.\u201d Scientists from the foundation compile data for 13 indicators in three categories: pollution, habitat and fisheries. They assign each indicator a score from one to 100, and those results taken together resulted in this year\u2019s overall grade of 34. The group says a perfect score is not attainable because of population growth and development, but a 70 would present an A grade and a \u201csaved bay.\u201d Nine of the 13 indicators showed improvement from the last report, and each of the three categories improved overall. On water clarity, the report issued an overall grade of a D-minus. Still, that represented a two-point improvement from the previous report, and the foundation called it \u201cthe clearest water in decades.\u201d The indicator that showed the most improvement was the blue crab population, which the report said has increased dramatically since 2014, from 297 million to 553 million. The report noted that although this year\u2019s population was lower than the 2012 peak of 779 million, it reflects a \u201cmore resilient population\u201d because juvenile, male, and female spawning stock counts all increased.

Close MLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/Getty Images The report also found that the rockfish, or striped bass, population appeared to have stabilized after a 10-year decline, and oyster harvests exceeded one million bushels in 2015 for the first time in 30 years. \u201cNative oysters are making a comeback after a near commercial extinction,\u201d Baker said. The only indicator that showed a decline from the previous report was the prevalence of forested buffers, strips of trees that protect the water from soil erosion and pollutants. \u201cThe lack of progress is alarming,\u201d the report said. The foundation said that while Maryland and Virginia are largely on track to achieve the 2017 midterm goals of a joint state and federal agreement designed to reduce pollution in the bay, Pennsylvania is lagging. Those three states comprise about 85 percent of the watershed, Baker said. \u201cPennsylvania is significantly behind, largely due to its failure to meet the goals it set for reducing pollution from agriculture,\u201d the foundation said in a statement. Dr. Carl Hershner, director of the Center for Coastal Resources Management and a professor of marine science at William & Mary, said he thinks the report is confirmation that the investment of public money in efforts to improve the bay is paying off. Baker emphasized that any reduction in those efforts could quickly lead to a reversal of all the progress that\u2019s been made. \u201cWe have to keep this up. These big systems can turn on a dime,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Jenna Portnoy and Lisa Rein January 5 at 9:59 AM Follow @jennaportnoy Follow @Reinlwapo House Republicans this week reinstated an arcane procedural rule that enables lawmakers to reach deep into the budget and slash the pay of an individual federal worker \u2014 down to $1 \u2014 a move that threatens to upend the 130-year-old civil service. The Holman Rule, named after an Indiana congressman who devised it in 1876, empowers any member of Congress to propose amending an appropriations bill to single out a government employee or cut a specific program. The use of the rule would not be simple; a majority of the House and the Senate would still have to approve any such amendment. At the same time, opponents and supporters agree that the work of 2.1\u00a0million civil servants, designed to be insulated from politics, is now vulnerable to the whims of elected officials. The revival of the Holman Rule was the brainchild of Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), who is intent on increasing the powers of individual members of Congress to reassign workers as policy demands. He favors a strategic application, likening it to a bullet from a sniper rifle rather than a shotgun. It\u2019s unlikely \u2014 but not impossible \u2014 that members will \u201cgo crazy\u201d and cut huge swaths of the workforce, he said. (C-Span) \u201cI can\u2019t tell you it won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday in his office. \u201cThe power is there. But isn\u2019t that appropriate? Who runs this country, the people of the United States or the people on the people\u2019s payroll?\u201d Democrats and federal employee unions say the provision, which one called the \u201cArmageddon Rule,\u201d could prove alarming to the federal workforce because it comes in combination with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the Washington bureaucracy, his call for a freeze on government hiring and his nomination of Cabinet secretaries who in some cases seem to be at odds with the mission of the agencies they would lead. \u201cThis is part of a very chilling theme that federal workers are seeing right now,\u201d said Maureen Gilman, legislative director for the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal employees. The rule is particularly troubling to Virginia and Maryland lawmakers and the District\u2019s nonvoting delegate, who represent large numbers of federal workers in the capital region. The Holman provision passed Tuesday as part of a larger rules package but was overshadowed by the Republicans\u2019 effort to weaken the House ethics office on the first day of the new Congress. [ A day of chaos at the Capitol as House Republicans back down on ethics changes ] Republican leaders say the rule increases accountability in government and played down concerns \u2014 some within their own party \u2014 that it will usher in broad changes to the appropriations process. As a concession to Republicans who oppose the rule, leaders designed it to expire in one year unless lawmakers vote to keep it in place. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that voters elected Trump with the hope of fundamentally changing the way government works and that the Holman Rule gives Congress a chance to do just that. \u201cThis is a big rule change inside there that allows people to get at places they hadn\u2019t before,\u201d he told reporters this week. Asked which agencies would be targeted, he said that \u201call agencies should be held accountable and tested in a manner, and this is an avenue to allow them to do it.\u201d The rule was the first thing House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) railed against in a floor speech Tuesday. \u201cRepublicans have consistently made our hard-working federal employees scapegoats, in my opinion, for lack of performance of the federal government itself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this rule change will allow them to make shortsighted and ideologically driven changes to our civil service.\u201d The rule changes the process of passing spending bills by allowing any rank-and-file House member to propose an amendment that would cut a specific federal program or the jobs of specific federal employees, by slashing their salaries or eliminating their positions altogether. Before the change, an agency\u2019s budget could be cut broadly, but a specific program, employee or groups of employees could not be targeted because of civil service protections. Republicans and Trump advisers have been quietly drawing up plans since the election to erode some of the job protections and benefits that federal workers have received for a generation, starting with a hiring freeze Trump has pledged to put in place in his first 100 days in office. [ Trump has a plan for government workers. They\u2019re not going to like it. ] Those plans include an end to automatic raises, a green light to fire poor performers, less generous pensions and a ban on union business on the government\u2019s dime. Conservatives were thwarted from making these changes under President Obama, but with unified Republican rule in Washington and Trump pledging to shrink big government and shake up a system he has characterized as awash in \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse,\u201d they are more emboldened than ever. Federal unions and their advocates in Congress \u2014 and even the Republican behind the rule \u2014 scrambled Wednesday to understand how the Holman rule would work. \u201cNow any backbencher can make an amendment to hear his voice heard on a particular program or group of employees,\u201d said Max Stier, president and chief executive of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it\u2019s used, if it\u2019s used.\u201d In light of recent inquiries by the Trump transition team about a list of Energy Department scientists who have worked on climate change, advocates for federal workers say they worry that bureaucrats could be targeted for political reasons. Jeffrey Neal, former personnel chief at the Department of Homeland Security and now a senior vice president at ICF International, said the rule \u201ccreates a lot of opportunity for mischief.\u201d Lawmakers could, in theory, even vote to roll back the 2.1\u00a0percent pay raise Obama gave federal employees starting Jan. 1, Neal said. Early in its history, the rule was used to eliminate patronage jobs, particularly customs agents, in the late 19th century before the federal workforce shifted to a nonpolitical civil service. The rule was dropped in 1983, when then-Speaker Thomas \u201cTip\u201d O\u2019Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) objected to spending cuts proposed by Republicans and conservative Democrats. Griffith, known as the unofficial parliamentarian in the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, sought to revive it out of frustration with an $80\u00a0million federal program that pays for the care of wild horses on federal land in the West. He considers the program wasteful. Although Griffith has few federal workers in his poor and rural district in southwest Virginia, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) noted that many of Griffith\u2019s constituents rely on federal programs. \u201cIt\u2019s a back-door way of furthering your desire to dismantle that part of the federal operation,\u201d he said. Connolly and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who each represent thousands of government employees in their Northern Virginia districts, said the rule heralds a new era of granular governing, giving the party in power the ability to mess with federal agencies at a microscopic level. Several House Republicans tried to block revival of the Holman Rule in a closed-door meeting Monday evening. Rep. Barbara Comstock, the only Republican member of Congress from Northern Virginia, voted for an amendment sponsored by Reps. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) and Rob Bishop (R-Utah) to strip the rule from the package. The rule \u201cdiminishes the roles of the authorizing committees in the House, and will make it more difficult to pass appropriations bills in the new Congress,\u201d Comstock\u2019s spokesman, Jeff Marschner, said in a statement. However, when the rules package, including the Holman measure, came to the floor Tuesday, she voted for it, as did all but three Republicans. All the Democrats voted no.

The attack was recorded on Facebook Live. William Lee Contact Reporter A mentally disabled man attacked and racially taunted on a Facebook Live video was able to leave a West Side apartment after a neighbor complained about the noise and distracted his attackers, authorities said Thursday. Two of them followed the neighbor downstairs and the 18-year-old victim took the opportunity to leave the building in the 3300 block of West Lexington Street, ending a five-hour ordeal, police said at a news conference. Officers found the man wandering the streets in the Homan Square neighborhood around 5:15 p.m., police said. \"I observed him wearing a tank top, inside-out, backwards, jean shorts and sandals on,\" said Officer Michael Donnelly. \"He was bloodied, he was battered. \"He was very discombobulated,\" he added. \"He was injured. He was confused.\" Hate crime charges filed in Facebook Live attack Chicago police speak to press\u00a0about the attack of a man with special needs that was captured in a Facebook Live video and the resulting charges filed against four people involved in the attack. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) Chicago police speak to press\u00a0about the attack of a man with special needs that was captured in a Facebook Live video and the resulting charges filed against four people involved in the attack. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) See more videos According to the video, the man's wrists had been bound and his mouth taped shut as two men cut his shirt with knives, then took turns punching him and stomping his head. One of the men cut the victim\u2019s scalp with a knife. As the man crouched against a wall, someone shouted, \u201cF\u2011\u2011\u2011 Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cF\u2011\u2011\u2011 white people.\u201d Four people were arrested after the downstairs neighbor called police because two of the suspects had kicked in her door, angry that she threatened to call 911, according to Area North Cmdr. Kevin Duffin. \"They booted her door and they actually grabbed something on their way out,\" he said. Jordan Hill, 18, of\u00a0 Carpentersville, Tesfaye Cooper, 18, of Chicago, Brittany Covington, 18, of Chicago and her sister, Tanishia Covington, 24,\u00a0 of Chicago were all charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Hill was also charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary, and both Cooper and Brittany Covington were charged with residential burglary. Hill knew the victim from a school they attended in Aurora and was\u00a0 with the victim when police found him. Police did not explain what Hill was doing there. All four suspects have given statements admitting to their roles in the attack, police said. They are due in bond court Friday. Asked about the video that helped in the arrests, Duffin said, \"I can\u2019t understand why anybody puts anything on Facebook.\" Beating of disabled teen captured on Facebook Live Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man.

(Warning: Contains graphic content) Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) See more videos The victim's family had dropped him off at a McDonald's in Streamwood on Saturday to meet Hill, with plans to spend the night at his place. \u00a0 Hill stole a van before picking up the victim and passed it off as his own, police said. The pair drove to Chicago's West Side, visiting with friends for two days. The victim slept in the van before arriving at the apartment on Lexington where the Covington sisters lived on Tuesday. Hours into the visit, the victim and Hill were engaged in a \"play fight\" when it got out of hand, police said. The sisters got angry and tied him up, police said. \"That's when the attack begins,\" Duffin said. They beat, stomped and cut the victim and made him drink water from the toilet, he said. The victim was tied up for four or five hours until he escaped. After police found him on the street, they discovered that he had been reported missing on Sunday. He was taken to a hospital and reunited with his family. Superintendent Eddie Johnson said there \"was never a question\" whether the case would be investigated as a hate crime, but police wanted to check all the facts of the case first. He said the racial comments of the attackers and the disabilities of the victim both played a role in the decision. ",

The video, which has since been taken down, appears to show the torture and taunting of a white special needs man. USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama attends the Armed Forces Full Honor Review Farewell Ceremony at Joint Base Myers-Henderson Hall in Arlington, Virginia, Wednesday. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images) 221 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 72 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama said Thursday that racial tensions haven't gotten worse in his time as president \u2014 they've just become more apparent because of the power of cell phone videos and social media. Case in point: the\u00a0\u00a0live-streamed Facebook video showing four African-American youths in Chicago tying up, beating and torturing\u00a0a white special needs student. Obama called the attack a \"despicable sort\" of\u00a0hate crime. But he also\u00a0 told Chicago's WBBM \u00a0that racial incidents get more attention now \"in part because we see visuals of racial tensions, violence and so forth because of smart phones and the Internet.\" Obama gave a round of interviews with Chicago television stations as he prepares to deliver his farewell address in his hometown next Tuesday. But the interviews were dominated by racial issues and urban violence. \u201cWhat we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,\" he said. In a separate interview with WLS, he recalled the racially polarizing Chicago \"Council Wars\" of the 1980s. \"Some of your viewers are too young to remember this stuff. I promise you, for the most part, race relations have gotten better.\" Obama said the violence plaguing Chicago was heartbreaking, but also a \"strange exception\" to the national trends. And he said he want's be be \"part of the solution.\" \"What I intend to do is to build off of some of the work that has been in done in other cities to intervene in violence, provide better support for youth that are at risk,\" he said. \"And my presidential center and me personally, this is something where we want to join those who are intent on doing something about this. I want to be a part of the solution.\" Obama is building his presidential library in Chicago's Jackson Park neighborhood. \"These are communities I know and love, and there's so many good people there,\" he told WLS. \"And there are people I know who have been personally affected by levels of violence.\" The interviews were part of Obama's \"Live from the White House\" strategy, which has brought 155 local television and radio reporters to the White House for one-on-one interviews, according to a USA TODAY tally.\u00a0At times, he brought so many reporters to the White House that\u00a0 he needed cue cards \u00a0to keep their names and cities straight. Those appearances,\u00a0mostly during his first term, allowed him to bypass the national media and target his message to local communities on topics like Obamacare, the minimum wage and trade. But until Thursday, Obama had done only one interview with a Chicago station during his presidency. The interviews focused on Chicago issues but also covered some other topics: \u25ba On the tensions between President-elect Donald Trump and the intelligence community: \"My experience over the last eight years and the experience of most presidents is we cant make good decisions unless we have good intelligence,\" he told WMAQ . \"And it's important that the president is getting the very best non-politicized intelligence possible, because national security is at stake.\" But he also said he's also optimistic that \"some of those current tensions will be reduced\" once Trump starts getting his briefings from his own hand-picked intelligence officials. \u25ba On a commutation for former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, convicted of trying to sell Obama's former senate seat: \"We have steps that go from the Justice Department and the White House counsel's office, and then I study these cases on an individual basis,\" he told WMAQ.. \u00a0\"On some of these high profile cases, we'll see what gets to my desk.\" 221 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 72 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hXVemP NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

House Republicans' decision to tie defunding the women's health organization to the Obamacare repeal effort could turn off moderate Republicans, complicating the fragile coalition that the party must maintain in order to undo the massive health care law. Play War over Obamacare escalates on Capitol Hill 6:09 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170106093227if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/848370755865\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> One such Republican, Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, has already voiced concern. While she said it's \"really premature\" to say if she'd vote against a repeal defunding Planned Parenthood, she did say she would fight to strip such a measure from the bill. \"There's a group of House Republicans led by (Rep.) Charlie Dent (R-PA) who are opposed to the defunding of Planned Parenthood in the bill, and I hope they'll be successful in separating the two issues or knocking it out all together,\" Collins told reporters Thursday. Collins voted against the last major effort to repeal the ACA, also referred to as Obamacare, in 2015 in part because Planned Parenthood defunding was included. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois took the same stance but he was defeated in his re-election bid last year. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, opposed previous efforts to strip money from the organization, as well, and could be a critical vote. But Collins might see more support from moderate Republicans this year because any repeal effort that passes is likely to be signed by incoming President Donald Trump. Repeal of Obamacare is only going to need the support of a simple majority of senators. With 52 Republican senators, only three need to defect. House Republicans, who enjoy a much larger majority, must also take Republican defections into consideration. There is already concern among conservative Republicans over the timeline for replacement and that not all tax increases that are part of the ACA, such as the tax on medical devices and the tax on high cost health insurance plans, will be repealed, also threatening Republican repeal efforts. Not funding $500 million per year for Planned Parenthood would give the GOP some much needed cash to pay for their healthcare replacement while also satisfying the socially conservative portion of their base. Related: Replacing Obamacare Will be Difficult, Repealing it Will be Just as Hard A group of Senate Democrats hastily convened a news conference to respond to the Ryan's pronouncement. \"This is outrageous,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington. \"We are going to fight back every step of the way.\" The vast majority of Planned Parenthood's services revolve around women's health care, including cancer screening, maternity care and preventative care. The government provides approximately half of the national organization's money \u2014 a little more than $500 million dollars per year \u2014 but that money does not go to fund abortions, complying with federal law that outlaws the federal funding of abortion.

    "text": "Top Democrat Would Support Challenge to Electoral Vote Certification By Meridith McGraw Jan 5, 2017, 7:17 PM ET 0 Shares Star Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., speaks as House Democrats hold a news conference to call for presidential action on immigration, Nov. 13, 2014. 0 Shares Email The second-ranking House Democrat, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, would support an effort to challenge certification of the votes that will formally put Trump in the White House on Friday, he told ABC News Political Director Rick Klein on the \"Powerhouse Politics\" podcast. Congress is slated to count the Electoral College ballots to officially elect Donald Trump as President on Friday, but a few House Democrats, led by Rep. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, are weighing options to protest the Electoral College votes. The only hitch? House Democrats must get the support of a U.S. Senator to move the challenge to an official congressional debate -- something Hoyer doubts is possible. According to Politico, who first reported the protest, if the House members secure the backing of a Senator, the House and Senate would have to debate each Electoral College vote. \u201cI don't frankly think he's going to get a Senator to join in with him, which the process requires,\u201d said Hoyer. But, \u201cif he has the Senator, I will support him.\u201d Today, Perlmutter released a statement saying the House Democrats' protest \u201cis not about trying to stop Donald Trump from becoming President,\u201d but \u201cthe fact that our liberty, freedom and democracy were compromised by Russia\u2019s intrusion into America\u2019s election.\" \u201cI think Mr. Perlmutter raises very legitimate issues,\u201d said Hoyer. \u201cIt's based upon the Russian interference in the election....there's no disagreement in the intelligence community.\" \"Whether it's done tomorrow or not, we are going to be pressing very, very, hard to get at the bottom of this,\u201d Hoyer said, admitting that Trump will be president even if the challenge succeeds. But whether or not suspected Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee influenced the 2016 election isn't the only hotly contested debate on the Hill this year: already House lawmakers have sparred over changes to their independent ethics watchdog -- something Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma says would have succeeded without a rebuke from President-elect Trump. \"These guys have never had a president that could literally reach into their districts and move public opinions,\" Cole said on the \"Powerhouse Politics\" podcast. \"This [President] has a unique tool that has never existed before with a list of 20 million followers. As I said, it\u2019s going to be an eye-opener for some people.\" But the biggest battle coming up? Republicans are dedicated to repealing and replacing President Obama\u2019s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act . \"Repealing it without a replacement is irresponsible and dangerous and will put literally of millions and millions and millions of Americans at risk, including those who are covered by -- who have an employer policy,\u201d said Hoyer, the Democratic whip. \u201cWe think it's irresponsible.\u201d Still, he says Democrats will work with Republicans if he thinks they\u2019ve found an alternative that works for everyone. \u201cAssuming repeal happens, I think that Democrats will continue to be committed to making sure, to the extent that we can, that every American has the availability of affordable, quality healthcare.\" he said. \u201cIf they have such an alternative, they've hidden it very well over the last six years,\" Hoyer added.

    "text": "Email CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The owner of a now-closed beef-jerky maker is being sued by the federal government for firing an employee who tried to call 911 to help a co-worker with a severed thumb. John M. Bachman, who owned the Lone Star Western Beef plant in Fairmont, could be forced to pay back wages and punitive damages to the employee as a result of the lawsuit, which the U.S. Labor Department filed Thursday against him and his company in federal court in Clarksburg. The lawsuit said that when a band saw severed part of a worker\u2019s right thumb in July 2014, his co-worker applied pressure to the wound while using her cell phone to call 911. But before responders could answer, Bachman allegedly ordered her to hang up, and she was fired two days later. Instead of calling an ambulance, Bachman collected the severed part of Chris Crane\u2019s thumb and told a supervisor to take him to an urgent care clinic. Crane was ultimately transferred to a hospital, where efforts to reattach the thumb were unsuccessful, the lawsuit said. The co-worker, Michele Butler-Savage, told a U.S. agriculture inspector later that day that Bachman did not fully clean or sanitize the area of the plant where the accident happened. She also mentioned a lack of personal protective equipment. After she was fired, she filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which found the company violated federal whistleblower protections for workers who report violations of the law. OSHA regional administrator Richard Mendelson said Butler-Savage\u2019s effort to show \u201cbasic human decency\u201d was protected under federal safety and health laws. \u201cLone Star Western Beef punished an employee for seeking emergency medical care for a seriously injured co-worker,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cNo worker should have to fear retaliation from their employer for calling 911 in an emergency, or taking other action to report a workplace safety or health incident.\u201d Bachman didn\u2019t immediately return a message left at a telephone number listed on the company\u2019s website.  In January 2015, the plant closed and relocated to Reading, Pennsylvania, the Labor Department said. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also took a swipe at the president-elect for \"disparaging\" the intelligence community. Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Russia had stepped up its cyber espionage operations, but stopped short of declaring the Russian election hacking an \"act of war,\" saying that would be \"a very heavy policy call\" more appropriate for others to make. The high-stakes Senate Armed Services Committee's hearing came after president-elect Donald Trump continued to cast doubt Wednesday on intelligence findings that Russia hacked Democratic National Committee emails. It also comes on a day in which lawmakers were being briefed on the breadth and depth of Russian interference in the American election and on the eve of Trump's own in-depth briefing on the matter. NBC News confirms President Obama has received and was orally briefed on the report on Thursday. Clapper, who will leave his post in the coming weeks, told the committee that lawmakers would be briefed next week and a redacted report was scheduled to be released afterwards. He took a parting shot at Trump as he reasserted intelligence findings about Russian election hacking. DNI chief James Clapper, center, talks with NSA chief Adm.

Evan Vucci / AP \"I think there is a difference between skepticism and disparagement,\" Clapper responded after being asked by Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill \"Who benefits from a president-elect trashing the intelligence community?\" Trump has questioned the intelligence community's findings, most recently on Wednesday as he quoted Assange, who continues to deny Russia was the source of Democratic emails published by WikiLeaks. \"Julian Assange said \"a 14-year old could have hacked Podesta' \u2014 why was DNC so careless?\" Trump said on Twitter. \"Also said Russians did not give him the info!\" However, Clapper said Russia had \"clearly assumed an even more aggressive cyber posture by increasing cyber espionage operations, leaking data stolen from these operations, and targeting political infrastructures systems.\" Play ",

Host talks to TODAY about the big night 2017-01-05T13:42:00.000Z Jimmy Fallon will usher in the 2017 awards season as host of the Golden Globes Sunday night, so get ready for some star-studded barbs. Closed Captioning Jimmy Fallon: Donald Trump will tweet as I host Golden Globes Play Video                      - 4:47 Jimmy Fallon: Donald Trump will tweet as I host Golden Globes Play Video                     - 4:47 \u2018Moonlight\u2019 star Mahershala Ali celebrates first Golden Globe nomination The yearly ceremony stands out for being both the first Hollywood gala of the year and the edgiest. So who does Fallon have in his sights? He sat down with TODAY's Matt Lauer and talked targets \u2014 sort of. \"That's classified,\" the \"Tonight Show\" host teased when asked about his zingers-to-come. \"Only me and Russian hackers know who I'm gonna hit.\" Samantha Okazaki\u00a0/\u00a0TODAY Matt Lauer and Jimmy Fallon, who is hosting the Golden Globes on Sunday. Is that a hint? \"Let me try and think,\" Matt mused. \"The show is airing less than two weeks before (the inauguration).\" Yes, President-elect Donald Trump may not be a Hollywood heavyweight, but there's a chance he'll get a mention \u2014 or ten \u2014 come show time. And he might just mention the show in return. More Movies videos \"I heard that Trump will be live tweeting during the show \u2014 '#unfunny,' I know,\" Fallon laughed. Samantha Okazaki\u00a0/\u00a0TODAY Jimmy Fallon is ready to get the Globes underway as host of the 74th annual Hollywood bash. But even if Trump is among those on the receiving end of a few friendly jabs, that doesn't mean Fallon is out to make a statement at the Globes. \"The Golden Globes is a night about fun and celebrating Hollywood,\" he said of his upcoming gig. \"There will be a few political jokes but \u2014 like \"The Tonight Show\" \u2014 we aren't very politics heavy. Samantha Okazaki\u00a0/\u00a0TODAY \"Only me and Russian hackers know who I'm gonna hit,\" Fallon joked. Besides, Fallon's job \u2014 as he see it \u2014 isn't about getting political. It's about getting the good times going. \"I think the job of the host of these shows is to come out with some fun opening, have some jokes, and then just kind of, 'Let's go!'\" he explained. \"Let's give it to the stars ... keep the music going good, the food is good. You know, you're hosting a party!\" Closed Captioning ",

(Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) Chicago police speak to press\u00a0about the attack of a man with special needs that was captured in a Facebook Live video and the resulting charges filed against four people involved in the attack. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) Jaweed Kaleem Contact Reporter It was a gruesome incident by any measure. A group of Chicago teens bound and attacked a mentally disabled teen\u00a0and broadcast the violence on Facebook for the public to see. But then six words the black attackers said as they assaulted their white victim changed the nature of things, sending what would\u00a0normally be a local crime investigation in one of the country\u2019s most violence-plagued cities\u00a0into the national fray over a\u00a0combustible\u00a0mix of race, social media and the presidential election. \u00a0\u201cF\u2014 Donald Trump \u201d and \u201cF\u2014 white people.\u201d Police charged four\u00a0teens on Thursday with kidnapping, battery and unlawful restraint after investigating the Facebook Live video that showed them\u00a0attacking and taunting the mentally disabled 18-year-old, punching him while yelling obscenities against the boy\u2019s race and Trump. The 30-minute video, put up on Tuesday and later removed, has spread widely online. It\u00a0shows the victim\u00a0sitting in a corner with his wrists bound and mouth taped shut as his attackers laugh at him. At\u00a0one point they attempt\u00a0to cut off a patch of his hair as his scalp bleeds. The victim was treated at a hospital for unspecified injuries and was reported to be home with his family. Police say they think the\u00a0victim, whose parents had earlier reported him as missing, was attacked because of his disability, not because of his race. Yet the references to white people\u00a0and the president-elect have set off a storm of animosity and finger-pointing. (Jason Meisner, William Lee and Steve Schmadeke) White nationalists have spread the clip online via Twitter, using the hashtag #BLMkidnapping to blame\u00a0the Black Lives Matter movement for the crime, although there is\u00a0no evidence of a connection. Conservative commentators have taken up the hashtag and complained that crimes against white Americans receive\u00a0less attention from\u00a0police and the news media than crimes against members of\u00a0other races. Civil rights groups that have tracked hate incidents since the election that have invoked the president-elect\u2019s name have publicly weighed in, while Trump supporters have pointed to the attack as evidence of what they say are growing threats of violence\u00a0against them.\u00a0 \u201cThis comes at a heated time, when different political sides are trying to gain currency, which misses the point. Whether it\u2019s [the Ku Klux] Klan and violence from them or violence like in this case, the actual facts of the situation can get lost,\u201d said Brian Levin, a professor at Cal State San Bernardino who tracks hate crimes. \u201cAnytime something is captured on video, especially if it involves social media, it can become volatile\u00a0and people become concerned just with what circulates in their social media world.\u201d In an interview with a Chicago television station, President Obama called the attack \u201cdespicable,\u201d but said he didn\u2019t believe there had been an increase in racial animosity in the country \u2014 just a greater awareness of it because of cellphones and the Internet. \u201cWhat we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,\u201d Obama told WBBM-TV Channel 2. Civil rights groups, accustomed to monitoring crimes against racial and religious minorities as well as against\u00a0immigrants and LGBT individuals,\u00a0said the attack and attention to it took them by surprise. \u201cThe crime is shocking. I\u2019m glad the authorities have moved so quickly,\u201d said Southern Poverty Law Center President Richard Cohen. Among the nearly 1,000 hate-related incidents the Montgomery, Ala.-based organization has tracked since the presidential election \u2014\u00a0many of which invoked Trump\u2019s name and targeted Muslims, blacks, Hispanics or immigrants\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Cohen said the organization also found 26 reports of incidents targeted against Trump supporters. I would say the level of hate in our country \u2014 and certainly after the election \u2014 has gone up over the last decade. We\u2019re becoming more polarized. \u2014 Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center It\u2019s unclear whether the Chicago victim, whose name has not been released, had shown\u00a0support for Trump.\u00a0 It\u2019s also unclear what broader views the attackers have\u00a0against white people or how they might have expressed them before the attack. Police reported that at least one of the suspects, 18-year-old Jordan Hill , attended school with the victim. Officials said the two met on Saturday at a McDonald\u2019s outside the city for a sleepover at Hill\u2019s. Instead, officials said, they\u00a0traveled to visit friends on the city\u2019s\u00a0West Side in a van\u00a0Hill had stolen and passed off as his own. On Tuesday, they ended\u00a0up at the\u00a0apartment where two of the other suspects\u00a0lived and where the attack occurred after what police described as a \u201cplay fight\u201d that got out of hand. The victim later escaped, and police found him wandering the streets. \u201cI took the anti-Trump rhetoric as a synonym\u00a0for anti-white rhetoric,\u201d said Cohen, who said he \u201cwould not rule out race\u201d \u2014\u00a0as opposed to only disability \u2014\u00a0as a factor in the attack. Cohen added that attacks against people over their disabilities\u00a0are typically low \u2014\u00a0just 1.2% of hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest FBI statistics. Richard Spencer, a white supremacist who runs a group called the National Policy Institute and has received widespread media coverage for his vocal support of Trump, attempted to use the\u00a0Chicago incident to show his view that whites are being attacked by Black Lives Matter activists.\u00a0 \u201cThis isn't even the first instance of terrorism against whites by anti-Trump #blacklivesmatter supporters in Chicago,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday. \u201cRemember the #blmkidnapping every time some journalist lies about my white advocacy organization and calls it a hate group,\u201d he tweeted the same day. Anti-white hate crimes are among the least common of attacks tracked by the FBI. Slightly more than 59.2%\u00a0of hate crimes in the country in 2015\u00a0had a\u00a0racial motivation.\u00a0Of those\u00a04,216 racially motivated hate crimes, more than half were against blacks, while\u00a018.7% of victims were targeted due to anti-white bias. \u201cThe FBI only tracks reported crimes that have been investigated, so it\u2019s hard to say with any broad certainty whether hate crimes against whites have gone up or down. But I would say the level of hate in our country \u2014\u00a0and certainly after the election\u2014\u00a0has gone up over the last decade. We\u2019re becoming more polarized and social media allows us to amplify it,\u201d Cohen said. Black activists such as those in the Chicago Black Lives Matter chapter have also used social media to fight back against accusations that crimes this week were related to their efforts. \u201cWe've stated time and time again, that we're against all types of harm and violence perpetrated and we've never condoned it. So this is absolutely perplexing and twisted that people are associating this atrocity with this organization and movement,\u201d the group said Wednesday in a Facebook post. \u201cIf you really cared about the victim then you'd be advocating for their care and treatment for trauma. That's what we want. We want centers for healing and mental health care,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, some people are more concerned with attacking us and they don't see how demented that is.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The deadliest fire in a decade has focused new attention on Ghost Ship warehouse owner Chor Ng , Congress is holding its first hearing today on the Russian\u00a0cyberattacks during the presidential election , Aerospace firms are stepping up competition with Silicon Valley for young engineers \u00a0and\u00a0 if Amazon\u2019s Alexa is always listening, can she incriminate you in a crime?

Jefferson Graham shows off 5 showstoppers from CES, including the Invisible Shield screen protector and video glasses for seeing your drone on #TalkingTech LAS VEGAS \u2014 When you\u2019re on the hunt for CES showstoppers, it\u2019s hard to top a man taking a hammer to an iPhone screen protector. Brad Bell, a marketing vice-president for Invisible Shield, was trying to prove how his new clear screen protection for smartphones is so tough, it could withstand just about anything. Brad Bell from Zagg uses a hammer to show off the protection their InvisibleShield provides smartphones at CES. \u00a0(Photo: Robert Hanashiro) Well, he did make a few dents, but the screen shield didn\u2019t crack, nor did the iPhone break when he kept dropping a big steel ball on it. Invisible Shield came to CES to launch its $79.99 \u201cbeta\u201d program, offering a screen protector with a guarantee that sees the company paying up to $100 if your screen gets cracked. How many people do you know with cracked smartphone screens? That\u2019s a CES showstopper. Mike Leyva from Epson, demonstrates the company's Moverio augmented reality smart glasses during the Drone Rodeo held annually before the Consumer Electronics Show. \u00a0(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) We also liked: \u2014 Epson\u2019s new video glasses, one for drones, the other for augmented reality. The Moverio BT-300, selling for $799, connects to DJI drones to show you what the quadcopter is seeing. This is a cool alternative to how we do it now: staring down at the smartphone, which acts as the viewfinder. Epson, best known for printers, also has a pair for augmented reality, showing information on the screen in real life. Its promo video on YouTube has an example at the gym, where workout information is added to what you see on the gym floor. \u2014 Pinball machines were at CES. Well, one company was, anyway.\u00a0Stern Pinball, showing off its brand-new Aerosmith- themed machine, with \u201ca more complex system of circuit boards and new types of displays,\u201d explains Stern\u2019s Jody Dankberg. Pinball is now \u201ca different, modern experience.\u201d Jody Dankberg from Stern Pinball plays the company's new game that uses the likenesses and music of Aerosmith. \u00a0(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) \u2014 Robots are everywhere at CES. We met a Chinese company, AI Nemo , which may be on to something. Its \u201cfamily\u201d robot, \u201cLittle Fish,\u201d is basically Alexa with a video screen, explains AI\u2019s Clement Song. \u201cYou can do a lot more than what you can just do with voice,\u201d he says. With the screen and a built-in camera, the robot gets to know you, so that for instance, online shopping can only be authenticated by you, not your kid. (No plans to bring the robot here \u2014 yet.) Christine Hamon from Sleep Number relaxes on the company's smart bed. \u00a0(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) \u2014 Finally, the tech product for everyone, a new mattress. The folks from Sleep Number are pouring on the hype, saying that it\u2019s new 360 mattress, a winner of the CES Innovation Award, is the \u201cbed reborn.\u201d \u201cIt can sense what you\u2019re doing in bed and automatically adjust,\u201d says Sleep Number\u2019s Christine Hamon. Machine learning features include automatically adjusting if you snore, adding\u00a0an automatic night light on the bed if you get up in the middle of the night, \u00a0and\u00a0pre-warming to toast up your feet on a cold night. It also connects to an app to offer information on how you\u2019re sleeping. A queen mattress starts at around $1,200 and will be available later this year.

At every turn last year, we were faced with choosing among bad options and making decisions we knew would bring a torrent of criticism.\" FBI Director James Comey is sworn in before testifying before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on \"Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, Sept. 28. JOSHUA ROBERTS / Reuters His comments came in an annual New Year message, sent Tuesday to FBI employees. \"People often ask me what we should do to respond to those who have questions or concerns about the FBI in the wake of a contentious election cycle. 'Do great work' is my answer,\" he said. \"When you know you have made decisions thoughtfully and consistent with your values, it is freeing, in a way.\" In the nearly 3,000 word message, Comey mentioned the probe into former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server only once, listing it as one example of events that made 2016 \"a challenging year.\" The list also included the Orlando nightclub shooting and the standoff at an Oregon wildlife refuge.

James Morales' capture in Somerville, Massachusetts, this afternoon came after he allegedly tried to rob a bank in Somerville and another bank in nearby Cambridge, Massachusetts, today. Morales was caught after he led authorities on a two-block foot chase, state police said. Morales, 35, had escaped from the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island, on New Year's Eve, authorities said. Morales -- a former Army reservist -- was in federal custody for the \"theft of numerous firearms from the Worcester Army Reserve Armory in 2015,\" Massachusetts State Police said. He was also wanted \"for an alleged violent and brutal sexual assault of a child,\" police said. U.S. Department of Justice/AP Photo This undated photo provided by the U.S. Department of Justice shows James Morales. A state and federal manhunt is underway for the inmate who escaped from the Wyatt Correctional Center, Dec. 31, 2017. This morning, Morales allegedly tried to rob a bank on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, which is about 50 miles northeast of the prison, law enforcement sources told ABC News. Police said he passed a note to the teller demanding money shortly before 10 a.m. The suspect did not get any money, police said. \"We do not have an identity of the suspect at this point in time,\" Cambridge police said at the time, but \"investigators are looking at the possibility that the suspect generally fits the description\" of Morales. FBI Boston Authorities are asking for the public\u2019s help to find a man to tried to rob a Bank of America located at 772 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Jan. 5, 2016. FBI Boston Authorities are asking for the public\u2019s help to find a man to tried to rob a Bank of America located at 772 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Jan. 5, 2016. Massive Manhunt Continues for Escaped Rhode Island Inmate Officials said Morales broke out of the prison on New Year's Eve by climbing a basketball hoop to reach a rooftop, cutting through a fence and then climbing through razor wire. Jamie Hainsworth, a U.S. marshal for the district of Rhode Island, said earlier this week Morales \"has the potential to be dangerous and could be armed.\" Hainsworth also said officials will take a \"hard look\" at the procedures of the Wyatt prison and investigate whether the community of Central Falls was appropriately notified of the escape. Morales was discovered to be missing by prison staff at 10 p.m. on Dec. 31 -- about three hours after he escaped, according to Hainsworth.

Daniel Coats pauses while speaking to the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, Nov. 30, 2016. =Albin Lohr-Jones/Pool via Bloomberg 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana to head the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, three senior Trump transition officials tell ABC News. Coats, 73, made a visit to Trump Tower late last year and said at the time that he was not seeking a position in the Trump administration. He was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee during his term, which ended this year after he decided not to seek re-election. The Republican is also a former U.S. ambassador to Germany under President George W. Bush. The consideration of Coats comes as a senior Trump transition official told ABC News that Trump and his team are mulling an overhaul of the DNI, which Trump spokesman Sean Spicer denied today. The DNI was created after 9/11 to coordinate the nation\u2019s intelligence gathering and analysis groups. Trump has clashed with intelligence communities over the last several weeks and said Wednesday that he agrees with Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, that Russia was not behind the cyberattacks on top Democrats. \"Julian Assange said \u2018a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\u2019 - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!\" Trump tweeted. James Clapper, the outgoing director of National Intelligence, was on Capitol Hill today to testify about Russia's alleged hacking during the 2016 presidential election. He told lawmakers his confidence was \"very high\" that the Russian government was responsible for the cyberattacks. 0 Shares ",

Marsha Blackburn, a stalwart critic of the Affordable Care Act , tweeted out the poll on Tuesday: Do you support the repeal of Obamacare? RT if you do, and share what you want to see as the replacement. \u2014 Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) January 3, 2017 And by the time it was over, nearly eight thousand respondents had overwhelmingly voted \u201cno\u201d and in favor of keeping the law, which is on the chopping block in the new Congress.\u00a0 The likely culprit for Blackburn\u2019s bad poll: Deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz, who retweeted it to his presumably left-leaning Twitter following. President Obama has stepped up efforts in recent days to help protect the law, seen as his signature accomplishment, and visited Capitol Hill earlier this week to discuss saving it.\u00a0 Republicans, who have been unified in their opposition Obamacare , say a repeal is on the way. In the meantime, however, they\u2019re struggling to figure out a replacement. On Wednesday, Republican President-elect Donald Trump tweeted the GOP needed to be \u201ccareful\u201d in how they dealt with the repeal.\u00a0 Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases...... \u2014 Donald J.

Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images U.S. forward Troy Terry scores the game-winning goal against Russia in the 2017 IIHF World Junior Championship semifinal in Montreal on Wednesday. Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images The United States hockey team bested Russia in a seven-round shootout Wednesday to secure a place in the IIHF World Junior Championship gold medal match on Thursday night. It was the Americans' first win over the Russians in an elimination round in the tournament's history. They had been 0-7. Tied at 3-3 at the end of regulation and through overtime, the game went to a dramatic penalty shootout that saw the crowning of a new American hockey hero: 19-year-old Troy Terry. The University of Denver sophomore and Anaheim Ducks prospect scored three goals, including the game-winner in the seventh round. \"If you would have told me before the game that I would be the guy going multiple times in a shootout I would not have believed you,\" Terry said, per USA Today Sports . According to International Ice Hockey Federation rules , a player can shoot again after all the players in the five-player shootout rotation have shot. In the initial five rounds, Terry and teammate Jeremy Bracco scored, and U.S. goalie Tyler Parsons made three saves. In the extra two rounds, Terry scored twice more . YouTube The feat earned comparisons to T.J. Oshie's shootout performance in the 2014 Sochi Olympics when he scored on four of six attempts to beat Russia in group play. It also recalled Canadian Jonathan Toews' three shootout goals in the 2007 World Junior Championship semifinal, which knocked the U.S. out of contention. Article continues after sponsorship And, of course, any time the U.S. tops Russia in hockey, there is inevitably a mention of the iconic Miracle on Ice game in which a young U.S. team downed the mighty Soviet Union squad in the 1980 Olympics. In the intervening years, the superpowers' hockey rivalry has faded. As The Washington Post's Dave Sheinen wrote in 2014: \"The hard edges of the U.S.-Russia rivalry have been softened by time, shifting geopolitical circumstances and the ubiquitous presence of Russians in the NHL, among other factors.\" In the 2017 tournament, developments in U.S.-Russia foreign relations \u2014 specifically U.S. intelligence concluding that the Russian government interfered in the presidential election \u2014 added a small but noticeable wrinkle to the rivalry, as some wryly pointed out on social media: USA coaches surprised Russia by using Troy Terry 3 times in shootout, which means they probably never mentioned that plan on email. #WJC2017 \u2014 Greg Wyshynski (@wyshynski) January 4, 2017 Man, that sucks for Russia, who will have to look for North American wins elsewhere \u2014 Bruce Arthur (@bruce_arthur) January 4, 2017 In Thursday night's gold medal match, the U.S. will face Canada, which beat Sweden 5-2 on Wednesday night. As the Associated Press reports, \"The United States and Canada have met three times for the title, with Canada winning in 1997 and the Americans in 2004 and 2010. Canada won the last of its record 16 titles in 2015.\" The U.S. beat Canada 3-1 earlier in the tournament. The game starts at 8 p.m. ET and will be televised on the NHL Network. ",

Republicans wrapped a provision targeting Planned Parenthood funding into their reconciliation bill to dismantle Obamacare last year, but President Obama, of course, quickly vetoed that measure. In response to Ryan\u2019s threat Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said Democrats would again fight against the GOP plan. \u201cWe are not going back. We will stand our ground. We will fight that decision by the speaker to defund Planned Parenthood. And you know what? The American people are with us. We just have to get out the word,\u201d she said. Republicans led the fight to defund Planned Parenthood in a massive government spending bill in 2015, prompting the possible threat of a shutdown. They later backed off and wrapped it into a reconciliation bill, which they are again using this year to repeal Obamacare. Through the reconciliation process, the Senate can fast-track a budget measure and pass it with a simple majority rather than a supermajority. The measure introduced this week tasks several different committees with drafting the legislation, which they must complete by Jan. 27. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

She was identified after police wrote a snarky post on Facebook. (Photo: Courtesy of Cappel's Ace Hardware) DES MOINES \u2014 A central Iowa police department got a little creative in trying to find an alleged shoplifter . Maybe the post was a bit sarcastic, maybe a tad mean. But that's what happens when your \"team made the NFL Playoffs\" and the police are fans of the \"STEALers.\" On Wednesday, the Norwalk Police Department posted two photos on its official Facebook page\u00a0of a white woman who is allegedly shoplifting \u2014 one image of the woman exiting Cappel's Ace Hardware store in town and the other showing the vehicle she was in. The incident happened Dec. 9,according to security camera footage from the store. \"Hey everybody my team made the NFL Playoffs!!!! I\u2019m the white female carrying the box. I just got a new TV and I needed a wall mount for it. I found some great deals at the Ace Hardware,\" the post read in part. Burglars smash hole to indoor gun range; grab rifles, pistols \"I got this mount for free when I apparently forgot to pay for it. I left the store in the pictured white car that my driver was waiting for me in. If you know who I am, please tell the cops,\" it continued. \"I\u00a0think they would like to come over and talk to me while we watch some football. Oh and if you were wondering, we like the STEALers.\" The post did the trick, generating more than 400\u00a0shares and helpful leads. Norwalk Police Chief Greg Staples said Thursday it was viewed 62,000 times, and that the suspect's name was provided \"55 minutes after we posted it.\" \u201cGotta love Norwalk's finest! You protect and serve and put your lives on the line every day for the community you love and you still crack us up with your posts.\u201d Rebecca Ewers, Indianola, Iowa The post even sparked laughs. \"Gotta love Norwalk's finest!\u00a0You protect and serve and put your lives on the line every day for the community you love and you still crack us up with your posts,\" \u00a0said Rebecca Ewers of Indianola, Iowa, about 10 miles away. Another came from a Pittsburgh Steelers fan,\u00a0Lynn Zook-Slagg of Norwalk: \"I'll refrain from being an offended Steelers fan because this is hilariously captioned!\u00a0I hope they are found!\" This isn't the first time Norwalk police have\u00a0used snarky humor on social media as a tool to locate suspects. In November\u00a02016,\u00a0the department was able to find\u00a0another shoplifter at a grocery store\u00a0in town. Wednesday's post\u00a0was the fourth time officers have posted\u00a0a suspect's photo on Facebook,\u00a0Staples said. And three out of those\u00a0four times, the suspect has been\u00a0identified within three hours, he said. Wendy\u2019s is cold on Twitter, some might even say frosty \"Police departments have been doing that all across the country for a long time,\" Staples said. \"If you can add a little humor to it, people might be more willing to share it and the audience might get larger.\u00a0A Facebook post about a low-dollar theft doesn\u2019t need to be serious.\" Follow Aaron Young on Twitter:\u00a0 @AaYoung15 555 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hXxteC NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

But President Obama\u2019s recent establishment of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and the Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada has caused Johnson and his neighbors to worry that the land his family\u2019s cattle has grazed on for generations may soon be off limits and that the landscape he has spent his entire life working may be inexorably changed. \u201cI think this land should have stayed open to everyone and not be regulated by the federal government,\u201d Johnson told FoxNews.com. Obama\u2019s designation late last month of Bears Ears and Gold Butte as national monuments \u2013 along with his recent ban on oil drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans \u2013 have earned the outgoing president the praise of both environmental groups and Native American groups as he secures his environmental legacy. Western state lawmakers, ranchers and those in the oil and gas industry, on the other hand, have widely panned Obama\u2019s monument proclamations \u2013 claiming that the president\u2019s so-called \u201cmidnight monuments\u201d do not represent the interests of the people in those states and will in time do more harm than good to the environment.

(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) \u201cThe midnight monument is a slap in the face to the people of Utah, attempting to silence the voices of those who will bear the heavy burden it imposes,\u201d Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said in a statement. \u201cIt does not have the support of the governor, a single member of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, nor any local elected officials or state legislators who represent the area.\u201d Chaffetz joined fellow Utah Rep. Rob Bishop in seeking a consensus on preservation and development between environmentalists, oil and gas companies, local officials and ranchers. The result was the Public Lands Initiative \u2013 which the Obama administration helped craft \u2013 but the bill failed to pass the House and was never introduced in the Senate. The failure of the PLI spurred the Obama administration to move quickly to draw up a Bears Ears National Monument designation \u2013 shrinking it from its originally 1.9 million acres to 1.35 million \u2013 and using the 1909 Antiquities Act to bring it to life. The move angered many Utahns still annoyed at President Bill Clinton\u2019s move in 1996 to name the 1.8 million acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. While economic growth spurred on by tourism has cooled some tempers, Clinton\u2019s and now Obama\u2019s moves still don\u2019t sit well with many in the Beehive State. \u201cI would like to see it all reversed and for Congress to get rid of the Antiquities Act,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTourists are going to pour in and destroy the land and other people won\u2019t be able to use it.\u201d Experts on public land law, however, argue that -- at least when it comes to the Bears Ears\u2019 designation -- very little will change in regards to grazing or the ranchers\u2019 livelihoods. Obama\u2019s proclamation last month made clear that the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service will continue to administer grazing permits and leases to \u201censure ongoing consistency with the care and management\u201d of both the flora and fauna in the monument and the protection of any Native American artifacts. As for hunting and fishing -- both popular pastimes in the newly named national monument -- Utah will retain jurisdiction over its fish and wildlife management. The only change is that ATVS and other off-road vehicles will be required to stay on certain designated trails and roads. \u201cIn the history of the West, ranchers have acquired a sense that they are effectively the owners of the land,\u201d Charles Wilkinson, a law professor at the University of Colorado-Boulder, told FoxNews.com. \u201cAny encroachment on the land is going to change this sense of control and there is already a longstanding, violent distaste for government intervention.\u201d This distaste was widely highlighted during the Bundy standoff of 2014, when the now-jailed, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and an armed group faced-off against federal and state law enforcement officials over a 20-year legal dispute in which the\u00a0BLM obtained court orders directing Bundy to pay more than $1 million in withheld grazing fees\u00a0on lands that would soon make up the 300,000-acre Gold Butte National Monument. Expand / Contract Rancher Cliven Bundy, flanked by armed supporters, speaks at a protest camp near Bunkerville, Nevada, on April 18, 2014. Bundy\u2019s battle has been going on since 1993, but it wasn\u2019t until 1998 that Nevada\u2019s Clark County bought out the grazing rights to the land in Gold Butte and retired it that Bundy\u2019s cattle became illegal trespassers on the land. The language of Obama\u2019s proclamation said that there will be no new grazing permits or leases on the land issued within the monument. \"We, the\u00a0Bundy\u00a0family, would like to say to President Obama that we are saddened, but not surprised, by the decision to make our ranch and home a national monument,\" the Bundy family said in a statement issued last week. \"The problems we have had with federal land management have never been about cows, tortoises or fees,\" the statement said. \"It has always been about the constitutional limits on the federal government's authority.\" While the Bundy family put a contentious face of ranchers in their discussions over public lands, both ranchers like Johnson and experts studying the issue say that these ranchers have been far from a destructive force against the environment. Overgrazing in certain sections of the Southwest has led to damaging of western watersheds and soil erosion, but many ranchers have seen that it is in their best interest to make sure that land has time to heal. \u201cThey deserve a lot of credit,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cRanchers are more concerned and do more for the environment than many others.\u201d He added: \u201cThey have been there forever and they want to continue to be there forever.\u201d Expand / Contract President Obama granted monument status to the rock formations in Gold Butte, shown in this 2012 photo, leading to the protection of the scenic and ecologically fragile area near where rancher Cliven Bundy led an armed standoff with government agents in 2014. (\u00c2\u00a9 Las Vegas Review-Journal 2012) The hope for many of these ranchers \u2013 and the fear of environmental activists and Native American groups \u2013 is that when Donald Trump takes office later this month with a Republican-controlled Congress, he will move to reverse Obama\u2019s decisions on the monuments. The issue is, however, that while the Antiquities Act gave a president powered to declare land that is of \u201chistoric or scientific interest\u201d a national monument, it is silent on any powers to abolish them. \u201cIt\u2019s really unclear what powers the president has to abolish these monuments,\u201d James Morton Turner, an associate professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College, told FoxNews.com. Trump himself has been ambiguous on his stance toward public lands \u2013 favoring energy development on them while also showing reticence to hand these lands over to the states \u2013 and he rarely brought up Obama\u2019s national monuments while on the campaign trail. The real power over the fate of the national monuments lays in the hands of Congress , which can create, abolish, change the size of and even hand over to individual states control of the monuments. New York\u2019s Father Millett Cross National Monument and Arizona\u2019s Papago Saguaro National Monument are part of the latter group. To abolish the monuments \u2013 or the Antiquities Act altogether - Republicans in Congress would need to pass legislation in both houses. That would require 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster and in recent years the Senate has tended to avoid any legislation until they get 60 votes. \u201cChange will not come easily,\u201d Turner said.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Watch the full story in the two-hour special, \"Truth and Lies: The Menendez Brothers,\" TONIGHT at 9 p.m. on ABC. Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents Jose Menendez, 45, a wealthy entertainment executive, and Kitty Menendez, 47, at their Beverly Hills mansion on Aug. 20, 1989. At the time of the murders, Lyle was 21 years old, and Erik was 18 years old. Courtesy Brian Andersen Jose and Kitty Menendez are seen here in this undated family photo. At their first trial, defense lawyer Leslie Abramson argued that Lyle and Erik shot their parents in self-defense because they feared their parents would kill them if they went public about the years of alleged molestation they suffered from their father. Their first trial ended in a mistrial on Jan. 13, 1994, because jurors were deadlocked and unable to come up with a verdict. The brothers were found guilty of first-degree murder in 1996 after a second trial and sentenced to two consecutive life prison terms without the possibility of parole. SLIDESHOW: Menendez Brothers: Their Childhood, the Murder, the Trial Vander Molen spent summers living with the Menendez family and testified at the brothers\u2019 first trial that Lyle confided in her about the alleged sexual abuse in the summer of 1976. At the time, Lyle was just 8 years old and Vander Molen was 17. ABC News Diane Vander Molen is the cousin of Lyle and Erik Menendez, brothers who were convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents. \u201cOne night, I was in my room changing the sheets in my bed, and Lyle came in,\u201d Vander Molen told ABC News. \u201cHe became very serious about asking me if he could sleep in the other bed next to mine and saying that he was afraid to sleep in his own bed because his father and him had been touching each other down there, indicating that it was his genital area.\u201d Afterward, Vander Molen said she told Kitty Menendez what Lyle said. \u201cBy her demeanor, I could tell that she was not believing any of this,\u201d Vander Molen said. \u201cAnd [she] went downstairs, and Lyle had already gotten into the bed next to mine, and she went ahead and yanked him by the arm and took him back upstairs and I never heard anything else about that.\u201d Brian Andersen Jose Menendez pictured with his sons, Erik, left, and Lyle. Vander Molen says she believed young Lyle\u2019s story because she saw that his fear was real. \u201cHe was scared to sleep in his own bed because he was afraid that his father was going to come in and molest him that night,\u201d said Vander Molen. Vander Molen said she assumed Kitty had put an end to the abuse because Lyle never spoke of it to her again. \u201cIn hindsight, I wish that I would have been stronger about what Lyle was telling me so I could have done something to help them,\u201d she said. Lyle and Erik testified at trial to their claims of their father\u2019s sexual abuse. ",

But some analysts are now wondering whether he can survive the latest storm. Netanyahu was grilled by police investigators for more than three hours at his official residence this week on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from wealthy donors. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Jonathan Ernst / Reuters file Police said Netanyahu was questioned \"under caution,\" a term signaling that anything he said could potentially be used as evidence against him. The Israeli Ministry of Justice confirmed that investigators from a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit met with him on Monday. They had received authorization from the country's attorney general. The 67-year-old, who is serving his third consecutive term as prime minister and his fourth overall, has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly called the reports about the investigation \"baseless.\" While Netanyahu has been dogged by inquiries about his conduct and those around him for years, no charges have ever been filed against him. His family's lifestyle \u2014 at taxpayers' expense \u2014 has also previously come under scrutiny. In 2013, he was chided for reportedly spending $127,000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin for a five-and-a-half hour flight to London for Margaret Thatcher's funeral. That came just months after the Netanyahu household's $2,700 annual budget for artisanal pistachio and French vanilla ice cream also made front-page news. \"If he survives, he will be even stronger\" Israeli commentators have pointed out that while Netanyahu has been questioned by authorities, that has happened many times in the past and prime ministers have gone on governing, sometimes for years. But some observers believe this case is different. \"This probably \u2014 almost 100 percent \u2014 could lead to the end of his tenure as prime minister,\" said Shimon Shiffer, chief political analyst for the Yedioth Ahronoth, a popular mainstream Israeli newspaper that has been critical of Netanyahu. \"If you ask my assessment, in this year, 2017, we will see the formation of a new government.\" Police are investigating Netanyahu over suspicions related to two separate issues, one more serious than the other, according to Israel's Haaretz and other media outlets. In the first instance, Netanyahu is suspected of receiving favors and gifts from wealthy businesspeople. Police suspect that the value of the gifts Netanyahu received to be in the tens of thousands of dollars. Ronald Lauder Evan Vucci / AP The Israeli police took testimony from the American cosmetics tycoon and philanthropist Ronald S. Lauder when he was in the country in September. He was summoned by police for questioning \"related to a certain investigation conducted by them and in which Mr. Lauder is not its subject matter,\" said Helena Beilin, Lauder's Israeli attorney. \"After a short meeting, he was told that his presence is no longer required and that there shall be no further need for additional meetings.\" Few details have been made public about the second investigation. Dr. Chaim Weizmann, an expert on Israeli politics at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, the largest private university in Israel, said he was unconvinced that Netanyahu's downfall was imminent. \"History teaches us we have both cases \u2014 Prime Minister [Ehud] Olmert, who did not survive, and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon who did.\" Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert waits to hear the verdict of his case at Tel Aviv District Court on March 31, 2014. He was later convicted of bribery. Dan Balilty / Pool via Reuters, file Olmert, who held office from 2006 to 2009, is currently serving 18 months in prison after being convicted of breach of trust and bribery in 2014. Sharon was questioned while in office in 2003 and 2004 over allegations of bribery and corruption involving him and his two sons. In 2006, his son Omri was convicted of corruption and served time in prison. Netanyahu was among the voices who called for Olmert's resignation back in 2008. \"This prime minister is sunk up to his neck in investigations and has no moral and public mandate to decide fateful issues for the State of Israel,\" Netanyahu told Israeli Channel Two News at the time. In November, a separate investigation was launched into reports that Netanyahu's personal lawyer represented a German firm involved in a $1.5 billion sale of submarines to Israel. In June, the Israeli attorney general ordered a probe after French businessman Arnaud Mimran, who was later convicted of fraud charges, claimed he donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Netanyahu's 2009 campaign \u2014 which the prime minister denied. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with wife Sara in 2015. Flavio Lo Scalzo / Reuters file Still, Netanyahu has never been formally charged with a crime. He and his family have always denied any wrongdoing and say they are the target of a witch hunt by the Israeli media. The day after being interviewed by police, Netanyahu wrote on Twitter: \"There won't be anything because there is nothing.\" He also decried \"years of daily persecution against me and my family.\" Israeli prime ministers are not obliged to resign if they are being investigated by police. But if the allegations actually lead to an indictment, by law he must resign, according to Weizmann. \"If he survives, he will be even stronger,\" Weizmann added. \"But if he doesn't survive it, he will be out of politics and possibly in jail.\" Petra Cahill ",

Johnson advertisement Kim Burrell's controversial sermon calling homosexuality perverted reflects a woman squeezed between two worlds: the black church with its traditional, heterosexuality-as-sin narrative, and the gay-friendly artistic arena, African American religion experts say. The Grammy-nominated gospel singer, in a now viral video, predicts gays and lesbians that those \"who play with it in God's house will die in 2017.\" Her comments were roundly denounced by a wide range of black artists from Pharrell Williams, who does a duet with her on the \"Hidden Figures\" soundtrack to Chaka Khan.

A theological student, who has pastored in Baptist and Pentecostal churches, was inspired to start a new blog, Hu-Muse , with Burrell's perceived hypocrisy as its first subject. \"I'm straight, but I'm sick and tired of hearing [about homophobia in the church],\" says Marlon Millner, a doctoral fellow in religious studies at Northwestern University who has followed the artist's career for more than two decades. Burrell, black religious studies scholars say, has benefited from the support of the LGBTQ community for years\u2014even as she preached against them. Indeed, Burrell makes a guest appearance on \"Godspeed,\" a song by Frank Ocean, wrote about his sexuality and romantic interest in a man. She was booked on DeGeneres' show to help promote the new film Hidden Figures before the host, who is a lesbian, uninvited her. Millner suggests Burrell can't have it both ways: \"If they're so bad say, 'No I can't go on your show,'\" Or, 'It's nice you would think of me Frank, but you're bisexual.' \" Darnell L. Moore, a writer-in-residence at the Center on African American Religion, Sexual Politics and Social Justice at New York's Columbia University, adds to the list of people Burrell should not profit from if she continues to condemn their sexual orientation: \"Tell LGBT people to stop placing their demonic tithes in your sanctified offering plates.\" Kim Burrell performs on NBC's \"Today\" show at Rockefeller Plaza on Dec. 9 in New York. Charles Sykes / Invision/AP In response to the backlash against her first video (apparently posted to the Internet by someone in her church), Burrell recorded a second one, suggesting that she'd been misunderstood. \"I never said all gays were going to hell,\" she said. Nonetheless, her comments rubbed a raw wound for many gays and lesbians in a number of black churches which have long wrestled with reconciling views on how to practice their faith while embracing homosexuality. Bishop Yvette Flunder, a pastor from Oakland, CA, who is a lesbian, wrote an open letter to \"Pastor Kim Burrell\" suggesting that she had \"touched the nerve of a wounded, greatly unappreciated and misunderstood group of people who have contributed countless underrated and unappreciated gifts to the church\u2026\" B.Slade, a singer with a Pentecostal upbringing whose career was temporary derailed when he admitted to feelings for the same sex, urged homosexuals to stop allowing themselves to be mistreated, he wrote . \"Black gay members continue to run to Pharoah's House [the Black Church] to be whipped back into submission to make the heterosexual majority comfortable,\" and where gays have \"been instrumental in building the foundation of too many mega Black Churches and careers of singers like Kim Burrell.\" Were it not for her fame, this story might never have gained traction, said Josef Sorett, author of the new book, Spirit in the Dark: A Religious History of Racial Aesthetics . Josef Sorett                 Department of Religion &amp;                 Institute for Research in African-American Studies                 Columbia University Courtesy of Josef Sorett \"Gospel artists have a degree of celebrity. They're featured on reality shows like Preachers of L.A. and Mary Mary,\" said Sorett, an associate professor at Columbia University, who runs its Center on African American Religion, Sexual Politics and Social Justice. He notes that gospel singer Donnie McClurkin, similar to Burrell in some ways, was catapulted to wider prominence with his appearance on the TV show Girlfriends , but later was uninvited from a 50th Anniversary March on Washington event after gay-rights activists protested his stance that God had delivered him from the \"sin of homosexuality.\" But Millner and other black religion experts said the black church needs to do more to be a welcoming place for all. \"Of all the things espoused in Christian theology,\" Millner said, \"justice, vengeance, wrath\u2026 The greatest idea we should try to uphold is love.\" Pamela K.

The suspects \u2014 identified as Jordan Hill, 18; Tesfaye Cooper, 18; Brittany Covington, 18; and Tanishia Covington, 24 \u2014 were charged Thursday ahead of an afternoon bond hearing. The charges also include aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi had tweeted Thursday morning that authorities were continuing to investigate the \"senseless attack. The attackers, who are black, were heard yelling anti-white epithets at various points throughout the 30-minute video. (Top, L-R): Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington (Bottom, L-R): Tanishia Covington, Tesfaye Cooper Chicago Police Department - AP The unidentified 18-year-old victim, described as having mental health challenges, went to school with Hill and had been willingly with him since Saturday, police said. They added that the two had been known to hang out, so the victim's family in suburban Chicago only first reported him missing late Monday. In a press conference on Thursday, the victim's family said that he is doing as well as he could be under the circumstances. But they were relieved he was home and offered thanks to local law enforcement. \"We appreciate all the support from everyone,\" the victim's brother-in-law David Boyd said on behalf of the family. \"This should never have happened,\" he added at the end of the press conference. Officials said Hill and the victim got into an argument that was allegedly made worse by the two women, who are sisters. In total, it is believed he was tied up for four or five hours on Tuesday. Police do not believe the event was premeditated. According to police, the suspects' focus on the victims mental capacity as well as his their statements about race is what led to the hate crime charges.

He had to be hospitalized, officials said. The video, which first aired Tuesday and was also uploaded to YouTube, shows the victim cowering in a corner as the group kicks and slaps him and cuts his hair until his scalp bleeds. The assailants can also be heard laughing, discussing drug use and yelling \"F--- Donald Trump!\" and \"F--- white people!\" Police confirmed the second video that showed the teen being forced to drink out of a toilet in a news conference. NBC News has not verified that second video. Play ",

Andrew M. Halpern/Flickr hide caption toggle caption Andrew M. Halpern/Flickr The National Institutes of Health has announced new guidelines for when parents should begin introducing peanut-containing foods into the diets of infants at risk for food allergies. Andrew M. Halpern/Flickr After multiple recent studies showing that feeding peanut-containing foods to infants can reduce the risk of peanut allergies, there are new federal guidelines for parents about when to start feeding their infants such foods. The National Institutes of Health announced Thursday that a panel of allergy experts recommends that parents introduce peanut-containing foods into the diets of babies as young as 4 to 6 months. As the NIH summary for parents and caregivers states, introducing babies with severe eczema or egg allergy \u2014 conditions that increase the risk of peanut allergy \u2014 to foods containing peanuts at that age can reduce the risk of developing peanut allergy. However, the guidelines spell out that these infants should be evaluated by an allergy specialist before their parents or caregivers introduce them to peanuts. Hey, Baby, Meet Peanuts: How And When To Safely Introduce The Food For infants without the risk factors of eczema or known food allergies, parents can stick to whatever age-appropriate diet they prefer. As NPR's Allison Aubrey reports, \"parents of infants used to be told to hold off on introducing peanut-containing foods, sometimes until the toddler years, especially if there was a family history of allergies.\" Experts thought this could reduce the chances of developing an allergy. But over the past few years, Allison says, several large studies such as this one and this one \"have found that babies at high risk for becoming allergic to peanuts are less likely to develop the allergy if they are regularly fed peanut-containing foods in the first year of life.\" As NPR's Patti Neighmond has reported : \"The guidelines are largely based on dramatic findings from a large study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. Researchers found that babies at high risk of developing a peanut allergy who were fed the equivalent of about 4 heaping teaspoons of peanut butter each week, starting at the age of 4 to 11 months, were about 80 percent less likely to develop an allergy to the legume by age 5 than similar kids who avoided peanuts. The benefit held up even after the children stopped getting the puree, a follow-up study found. \"Allergic reactions to peanuts can range from hives or rashes to, in the most extreme cases, trouble breathing and even death.\" Article continues after sponsorship The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has published the full text of the guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergies, as well as summaries for doctors and parents, on its website . YouTube Infants and small children should never be given whole peanuts due to the risk of choking, the NIH cautions. A video aimed at parents warns that even undiluted peanut butter can be dangerous for infants because it is thick and sticky. The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology video, which features Northwestern University pediatrician Ruchi S. Gupta, recommends adding hot water to 2 teaspoons of peanut butter to make a warm puree. Feed a little bit of the puree to the child, and then monitor for about 10 minutes to make sure there is no reaction such as hives, rash or trouble breathing before continuing to feed the child peanut-containing foods.

    "text": "Close Massachusetts State Police SOMERVILLE, Mass. \u2014 Police say they have captured a fugitive who escaped from a Rhode Island correctional facility on New Year\u2019s Eve, reports CBS Boston. James Morales, 35, who was on the run since he escaped Wyatt Correctional Facility, was captured in the Boston suburb of Somerville Thursday afternoon, Massachusetts State Police said. State Police said earlier Thursday that Morales was \u201cprobably\u201d the same person who robbed a Bank of America in Cambridge\u2019s Central Square Thursday morning. The suspect in an attempted robbery of a Cambridge, Mass. bank \u00a0seen in surveillance video Jan. 5, 2016 -- police believe the suspect may be James Morales Close FBI via CBS Boston The Bank of America in Central Square was robbed at 7:27 a.m., Cambridge Police said. They said a note was passed, but the suspect did not get away with any money. The robbery suspect was described as a black man about 5\u201910\u201d with a mustache, who was wearing a black jacket, gray sweatshirt, black knit cap, and black sneakers, matching Morales\u2019 description. Hours after the attempted robbery, police searched several locations in Cambridge near the Alewife MBTA stop Thursday afternoon after a possible sighting of Morales, according to the station. The search reportedly utilized K-9 units, and included marshy areas near the T stop. Morales escaped from Wyatt Correctional Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island around 7 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve, though he wasn\u2019t discovered missing until around 10:30 p.m. Two correctional officers have been placed on paid leave pending an investigation into the incident, the facility\u2019s warden, Daniel Martin, said. Warden Martin said Morales climbed onto the top of a basketball hoop in the facility\u2019s recreation yard, used a tool to cut through fencing, climbed onto the prison\u2019s roof, and went through several layers of razor wire to get to a place where he could climb down the side of the building. Police say he then followed nearby train tracks to Attleboro, Massachusetts, where they said he stole a car from a store parking lot and ditched it in Framingham. The car police said Morales stole was reportedly found in Framingham with blood, trash, and clothing inside, and with the Rhode Island plates replaced with Massachusetts ones taken from an apartment complex along Route 9. CBS Boston reports that on Saturday night, Framingham resident Vanessa Lugo said Morales showed up at her back door on New Year\u2019s Eve, hours after he broke free from prison. She didn\u2019t know who he was and didn\u2019t answer the door, later learning he was likely looking for the woman who lives upstairs. Before being imprisoned at the Rhode Island facility, Morales was facing charges that he raped an 8-year-old girl in Cambridge. While out on bail on that charge, the FBI says, he\u00a0 stole 10 assault rifles and six handguns from a Worcester armory in 2015 . \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The election\u2019s over \u2013 but Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails are still coming to light.\u00a0And they help illustrate why the FBI declared she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d with the information flowing across her secret server.\u00a0 A new batch of messages released by the State Department on Tuesday shows the former secretary of state and her team routinely shared her upcoming schedules, talking points and sensitive items \u2013 such as her iPad password \u2013 via the homebrewed system. Other newly revealed emails, which were posted as the result of litigation, show Clinton\u2019s top advisers griping about her during her time as secretary of State; an Asian ruler who later implemented Sharia law saying he considered former President Bill Clinton part of his \u201cfamily\u201d; and Clinton talking about Justin Cooper, one of the key figures who administered to her private server.\u00a0 ASSANGE: RUSSIAN GOV'T NOT SOURCE OF WIKILEAKS EMAILS Many of the 371 emails posted on the State Department website had been partially released previously, and are separate from the hacked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta posted by WikiLeaks before the election. Almost all the messages were partly or heavily redacted. Among the items redacted -- yet still sent over email -- was Clinton's iPad password.\u00a0 In an Aug. 20, 2012 conversation, Clinton\u2019s closest aide, Huma Abedin, told her boss she had the iPad password reset. The device had previously given Clinton problems, though Abedin wrote that it\u2019s \u201call good now.\u201d At the top of the message, Abedin typed out the entirety of the new password, which was redacted on the State Department release. Clinton responded later with even more information, noting that \u201cI finally realized I had to add the [redacted] to the password!!!!\u201d During the July speech in which FBI Director James Comey termed Clinton\u2019s server practices \u201cextremely careless\u201d but not criminal, he also said \u201chostile actors\u201d could have hacked her communications. In at least one instance, Clinton aide Cooper logged hacking attempts on the server.\u00a0 Still, Clinton and her advisers continued sending information that could be dangerous in the wrong hands, including detailed, advanced copies of her schedules and talking points for upcoming calls and meetings with foreign leaders and top U.S. officials. On Sept. 30, 2011 \u2013 the day American-born terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki was killed \u2013 Abedin emailed Clinton to say then-CIA Director David Petraeus wanted to talk on a secure connection. She added: \u201cAssume its about awlaki.\u201d Other emails released Tuesday shed light on Clinton\u2019s relationships. In advance of a September 2012 meeting with the Sultan of Brunei \u2013 who would later impose Sharia law on his country \u2013 Abedin emailed Clinton that Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah hoped to have dinner with Clinton and her family. \u201cThey say sultan sees wjc as part of his family and thus is treating you in this \u2018informal\u2019 way,\u201d she wrote, using Bill Clinton\u2019s initials. On Dec. 24, 2011, Clinton emailed Chelsea Clinton, who was using a pseudonym revealed previously by WikiLeaks, asking \u201cWho will provide tech support after Justin leaves,\u201d ostensibly citing Cooper, who originally helped set up Clinton\u2019s server and was typically called for any tech issues Clinton was experiencing. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this later \u2013 he\u2019s actually supported by someone else too as a fyi,\u201d Chelsea replied cryptically. \u201cI think there are a couple options.\u201d In an email chain from April 4, 2012 that Clinton was eventually excluded from, Abedin complained about Clinton\u2019s obsession with an archiving project. \u201cThis records thing is the bain of my existence with her\u2026.\u201d she wrote. Philippe Reines, another top Clinton aide, responded with the frustration he experienced explaining to Clinton that she had received the incorrect copy of a document. \u201cI emailed her that. I told her in the elevator up from videos. I told her that in the pre-brief. I told her that in the elevator up to 8. I made clear it wasn\u2019t that Jake [Sullivan]\u2019s timeline was \u2018inadequate\u2019 \u2013 just that the wrong version made its way to her,\u201d Reines wrote. \u201cBut [I] think it played into whatever anxiety she has that you\u2019re experiencing about the topic of archiving.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Hate crime charges filed in Chicago beating streamed on Facebook Live Published               January 05, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Hate crime and aggravated battery charges were filed Thursday against four African American suspects who police say tortured a mentally challenged white man for as long as 48 hours, while shouting racial and anti-Donald Trump slurs -- and part of the attack was streamed on Facebook Live. \"Let me be very clear: The actions in that video are reprehensible,\" Chicago Police Supt.\u00a0Eddie Johnson told reporters during a news conference. Expand / Contract Tesfaye Cooper, left, Jordan Hill, Tanishia Covington and Brittany Covington were each charged with a hate crime. (CPD) The suspects -- Jordan Hill, 18, Tesfaye Cooper, 18, Brittany Covington, 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24 -- were set to appear in Central Bond Court on Friday afternoon. Police on Thursday filled in details from the case. The 18-year-old man's parents had dropped him off at a McDonald's in suburban Streamwood last weekend to hang out with Hill, who took him in a van to see the rest of the group in western Chicago, investigators said, adding that the man didn't seem to know Hill had just stolen the van. FUROR ERUPTS OVER VIDEO OF OFFICER SLAMMING STUDENT TO FLOOR The man's parents apparently thought he'd be spending the night with friends, according to police. They said he and Hill had gone to school together in Aurora, although they didn't see each other frequently. Instead, investigators claimed the group kidnapped the man, keeping him tied up for hours or more with his mouth taped shut in an apartment on the city's west side. The video showed him cowering in a corner while someone yelled \"F--- white people!\" and \"F--- Donald Trump!\" At one point, the man was held at knifepoint and told to curse the president-elect. The video also showed the man being kicked and hit repeatedly, while his scalp was cut. The group apparently forced him to drink water from a toilet. The worst of the attack had started out as a \"play fight\" that ultimately escalated, police said. They told reporters the man slept in the van during the ordeal. The man finally escaped on Monday after a neighbor on a lower floor of the apartment building complained about the noise and threatened to call the cops, police said. They told reporters the suspects barged into the neighbor's apartment, giving the man an opportunity to get out. The four also face burglary charges in connection to the break-in. A police officer finally encountered\u00a0the disoriented man walking down a street on Monday wearing only an inside-out tank top, jean shorts and sandals, despite the frigid weather. The officer said it was clear the man had been bloodied and battered. Police became aware on Tuesday of the heinous video footage,\u00a0 FOX32 \u00a0reported. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest wouldn't say if he thought the incident was a hate crime, but did discuss the callous nature of the crime. \"They do demonstrate a level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans,\" Earnest said. \"I have not spoken to the president but I'm confident he would be angered by the images depicted.\" The suspects could be heard saying they wanted the video to go viral. They now face a bevy of charges. Hill was charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, robbery, residential burglary; Cooper was charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and residential burglary; Brittany Covington was charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and residential burglary; Tanishia Covington was charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Hill is from Carpentersville and the others are Chicago residents. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement Trending in U.S. 1 ",

    "text": "CNET Jan 5, 2017 11:09 AM EST Even before\u00a0 CES 2017 \u2019s official opening day Thursday, there\u2019s been a torrent of\u00a0 news from the annual consumer tech showcase \u00a0in Las Vegas.\u00a0 CES press day on Wednesday featured a long schedule of press conferences from big name companies battling to one-up each other. It\u2019s exciting and a bit confusing given the volume, but CNET is here to bring you the coolest and weirdest tech we\u2019ve seen so far. So buckle your seat belt, we\u2019re going for a ride. Always LG It\u2019s a CES tradition that LG opens press day with an early morning press conference. It\u2019s also appropriate given the Korean conglomerate\u2019s huge product range. And what\u00a0 a range it showed this time. First up, naturally, is a new TV (LG wouldn\u2019t be LG without one). Then again, you might call the\u00a0 W7 \u00a0OLED \u201cwall art\u201d instead. It doesn\u2019t sit on a stand or pedestal, but instead sticks to the wall through a special plate that uses both screws and magnets to stay put. So what, you say? Well, I\u2019ll tell you. The W7 is just 0.15-inches thick (about the size of a key), it\u2019s extremely light (the 65-inch model weighs 18 pounds and the 77-incher, 27 pounds) and it\u2019s flexible enough for you to peel it away from the wall. I think we can agree\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0pretty cool. There are a ton of other features so read our\u00a0 full preview \u00a0for more. Of course, the W7 will be expensive (at least $10,000) so if you\u2019re looking for a cheaper television, the\u00a0 B7, C7, E7 and G7 \u00a0deliver more conventional pricing and features. 21 Photos Cool tech at CES 2017 For the kitchen, LG formally launched the\u00a0 InstaView refrigerator \u00a0that we first saw at\u00a0 IFA \u00a0last year. We still don\u2019t have a price, but the giant touchscreen in the door now runs on WebOS and works with\u00a0 Amazon \u2019s digital assistant\u00a0 Alexa \u00a0instead of Microsoft Windows and Cortana . The new Quad Wash\u00a0 dishwashers \u00a0aren\u2019t quite as interactive, but four spray arms are supposed to cut cycle times by 15 percent. But, wait, LG isn\u2019t finished. The company also unveiled a\u00a0 lawn mowing robot , a\u00a0 Hub Robot \u00a0that works with Alexa and connects to other LG\u00a0 appliances \u00a0and a\u00a0 Leka smart toy \u00a0for children with learning disabilities. We also got our first chance to touch the 5.7-inch\u00a0 Stylus 3 \u00a0phone. On to Samsung Cross-Seoul rival Samsung showed its new\u00a0 series of QLED \u00a0televisions. They come armed with quantum dot technology, edge-lit\u00a0 local dimming \u00a0and a \u201cNo Gap\u201d wall mount. But unlike its TVs from last year, the Q9 is flat instead of curved. What to look forward to at CES 2017 For your lap, check out Samsung\u2019s new\u00a0 Chromebooks \u00a0and its first dedicated gaming\u00a0 laptops , the\u00a0 Odyssey 16 and 17 . They both have sleek designs with multicolored keyboard lights and cooling vents in a crosshatch pattern. Remember that Family Hub fridge from CES 2016? Well, it\u00a0 has new features . No, Samsung didn\u2019t announce a new phone, but it did start its event by\u00a0 mentioning \u00a0its disastrous\u00a0 Galaxy Note 7 \u00a0launch from last year. Tim Baxter, president and chief operating officer of Samsung Electronics America, said the company will share findings from its investigation into the exploding phone \u201csoon.\u201d And then Sony Sony ended the day, which was just as well given how underwhelming its announcements were. The company entered the OLED fray with the new\u00a0 A1E series . They come in 55-, 65- and 77-inch sizes, run on Android and work with Google Home. To go with that TV, Sony also has a new 4K Blu-ray player you might even be able to buy. The\u00a0 UBP-X800 \u00a0supports playback digital music and streaming Bluetooth to\u00a0 headphones \u00a0for private listening. Sony also had headphones,\u00a0 cameras \u00a0and a projector, some of which were old. Check out Katie Collins\u2019s\u00a0 full report \u00a0on the presser for details. But wait... There\u2019s always more. Here\u2019s what we found, starting off with, yes, more TVs . Hisense detailed its\u00a0 2017 TV lineup \u00a0and showed a crazy-expensive ($13,000!),\u00a0 100-inch TV \u00a0that\u2019s a 4K laser projector. TCL has three new Roku TVs in its\u00a0 P series \u00a0and new models for its cheaper\u00a0 C and S families . The\u00a0 Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom\u2019s \u00a0main attraction is the gargantuan 5,000mAh battery. Beyond powering the phone for a long time, it also can charge other devices. The Zoom\u2019s other features include two 12-megapixel cameras, a 13-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, RAW file support and a full manual mode. Asus \u00a0also has the\u00a0 ZenBook 3 Deluxe , which is a 13-inch laptop with a 14-inch screen. No, I\u2019m not kidding. The Garmin Fenix\u00a0 5, 5S and 5X \u00a0smartwatches all have an optical heart-rate sensor, all-day fitness tracking and the 5X comes preloaded with topographic US maps for turn-by-turn navigation. They sound a lot more exciting than these\u00a0 boring Casio smartwatches . If you love alfresco dining, but hate being in the sun, the\u00a0 ShadeCraft Sunflower \u00a0is an umbrella shade that will follow Apollo as he moves through the sky. The solar-powered shade also has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity and a built-in security camera. Because why not? The\u00a0 Incipio Command Kit \u00a0is a power strip that works with HomeKit and\u00a0 Amazon Echo . BlackBerry\u00a0 is back ! Its new phone, the\u00a0 Mercury , is a touchscreen Android phone with a QWERTY keyboard and a fingerprint reader. You know you\u2019ve\u00a0always\u00a0wanted a Bluetooth taster, so save your bread for the\u00a0 Griffin Technology Connected Toaster . It may be the most CES product there ever was. Intel demonstrated the first\u00a0 \u201cwalk-around\u201d VR experience . The\u00a0 Toyota Concept-i \u00a0car envisions a future where we communicate with an integrated artificial intelligence that predicts and meets our needs. The\u00a0 Rapael Smart Glove \u00a0uses a variety of sensors to guide a patient\u2019s rehabilitation for common hand and wrist injuries.

The future of the healthcare law is unclear. Mary Blair and her husband wait for a doctor's appointment at the Breathitt County Family Health Center in Kentucky, a state that has seen major changes through Obamacare. The future of the healthcare law is unclear. (Getty Images) Noam N. Levey Contact Reporter You\u2019ve seen the headlines and you\u2019ve heard the slogans:\u00a0 Obamacare is on the chopping block and President-elect Donald Trump is\u00a0going to replace it with \u201csomething terrific.\u201d But what are the new president and Congress really going to do? How much of the current law will really go away? And what could \u201cTrumpcare\u201d look like? In case it\u2019s been a while since you read about the Affordable Care Act and the GOP replacement plans, here\u2019s a refresher on the biggest Obamacare issues. Insurance mandates The current law: This one has been hard to miss. Obamacare, for the first time, required\u00a0Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. What\u2019s at issue: Nobody likes being told what to do.\u00a0 The penalty is supposed to discourage people from waiting until they are sick to get health insurance. This keeps premiums\u00a0in check by helping insurers get a\u00a0good mix of sick and healthy consumers. But this is the most unpopular part of Obamacare. What could change: The mandate is almost certainly on the way out. Republicans have made it the top target in their repeal plans. Less clear is what the GOP will put in place. Even Republican lawmakers acknowledge that insurance markets will not work unless there is some penalty for not signing up for coverage. One idea they have talked about is allowing insurers to charge consumers much more for premiums if they go on and off\u00a0health insurance. Guaranteed coverage The current law: Critics don\u2019t like to admit it, but this part of Obamacare really was revolutionary. The guarantee\u00a0allows Americans to get health insurance even if they\u2019re sick. That put an end to insurers denying coverage to people who had preexisting medical conditions. What\u2019s at issue: What\u2019s not to like about a guarantee? The rub is that it has made health insurance more expensive. Sick people typically have higher medical expenses. Because insurers spread\u00a0costs among all customers, that makes premiums higher for people who don\u2019t use the doctor or hospital very much. What could change: Republicans are smart enough not to say they\u2019re going to take this away. But some of their proposals let insurers\u00a0make sick people\u00a0pay more. The GOP also wants to slash\u00a0requirements that insurers offer a basic set of benefits, which could mean people buy health plans that don\u2019t cover some vital services, such as substance abuse treatment. Trump could use his\u00a0executive power to roll back some of these rules soon after inauguration. But scaling back this guarantee would likely require some help from Democrats.\u00a0That could be tough.\u00a0 Insurance marketplaces The current law: Buying health insurance was supposed to be like shopping online for a hotel room.\u00a0The Obamacare marketplaces, such as HealthCare.gov, allow people who don\u2019t get health benefits at work to compare plans.\u00a0And low- and moderate-income consumers get federal subsidies to help pay\u00a0their monthly insurance premiums. What\u2019s at issue: It\u2019s been a\u00a0rough ride for these marketplaces. Though subsidies helped many people find plans they could afford, some Americans who earn too much to qualify for aid have seen their premiums skyrocket as insurers struggled to adapt to the new marketplaces. That created a lot of angry customers in some parts of the country. What could change: Unclear. Republicans are gunning for the marketplaces. Their repeal plans call for eliminating the subsidies. And they\u2019ve said they want to scrap the rules that require health plans to include basic benefits. But major patient groups are warning that millions of sick people could be left without protections, which could make it hard for Republicans to follow through.\u00a0 Medicaid expansion The current law: For decades, being poor in America meant not having health insurance.\u00a0Obamacare tried to change that by offering states billions of dollars to expand Medicaid, the government health plan for the poor. That has helped millions of low-income Americans get health coverage over the last several years. What\u2019s at issue: Free federal money wasn\u2019t enticing for all states. To date, 19 states, all with Republican governors or legislatures, have rejected Medicaid expansion, saying Obamacare imposes too many rules. What could change: Also unclear. GOP repeal plans include rolling back the Medicaid expansion and slashing federal aid to states. And Trump has promised to let states redesign their programs, which might mean some start limiting benefits or requiring poor patients to pay more for their health coverage. But many Republican governors have expanded Medicaid, making it more difficult for Republicans in Washington to cut federal funding. Look for states to get more flexibility soon, though. Medicare The current law: This sacred cow was largely left out of Obamacare. The law made relatively minor changes to the popular health plan for the elderly and disabled, though it did expand coverage of prescription drugs. That\u2019s been popular with seniors. What\u2019s at issue: Not much, right now. But many Republicans, including Trump\u2019s pick to be health secretary, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), have long dreamed of overhauling Medicare and changing it into a voucher program that gives seniors a set amount of money to shop for private health plans. What could change: Medicare looks pretty safe. Trump has said he won\u2019t touch Medicare, and Senate Republicans haven\u2019t shown much interest in a major Medicare fight. So action on Medicare seems less likely this year. Taxes The current law: Nothing is free, alas. Obamacare\u2019s architects cobbled together a mix of taxes to offset the cost of subsidizing insurance for tens of millions of low- and moderate-income Americans. That has meant some new taxes on insurance companies and medical device makers (both of which, it was reasoned, were benefiting from getting new customers through the law). Wealthy Americans are paying a bit more, too. Families making more than $250,000 a year have seen their Medicare payroll taxes increase slightly, thanks to Obamacare. What\u2019s at issue: If there\u2019s one thing that Republicans seem to hate more than Obamacare, it\u2019s taxes.\u00a0 What could change: It\u2019s complicated. Most leading GOP repeal plans ditch the taxes, and congressional rules will allow them to scrap the taxes with no Democratic votes. But this one is causing headaches\u00a0for Republicans, who are waking up to the realization that they may need some of this tax revenue if they want to fulfill their promise to protect the millions of people who depend on Obamacare. That has prompted some GOP lawmakers to suggest that maybe they shouldn\u2019t scrap the taxes after all. Coverage for children up to age 26 \u00a0\u00a0 The current law: Obamacare\u2019s \u201cslacker mandate\u201d requires health plans\u00a0to allow adult children to remain on their parents\u2019 plans. What\u2019s at issue: Not a lot. Mom and Dad might not like their college grad living in the basement, but it turns out most parents like knowing their children can have health coverage into their 20s.\u00a0This has been one of the most popular parts of Obamacare. What could change: Almost certainly nothing. Trump and congressional Republicans say they\u2019ll keep this requirement.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Police said a 10-year-old Florida boy shot and killed himself Thursday after his mother \u201cwas addressing a behavioral issue\u201d before school and now they\u2019re investigating how the firearm was stored. Clearwater police spokesman Rob Shaw said Thursday afternoon that Ian Sevostjanov\u2019s mother had sent him to his room that morning.

USA TODAY Sports Dallas Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory (94) on the field before the game against the Detroit Lions at AT&T; Stadium. (Photo: Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports) The Dallas Cowboys will be without one of their promising young pass rushers this postseason. The NFL announced that defensive end Randy Gregory has been suspended without pay for \u201cat least one year\u201d for another violation of the league\u2019s substance abuse policy. Gregory had filed an appeal, which was heard earlier this week, according to multiple reports. For Gregory to return to the Cowboys, he will need to apply for reinstatement to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The top-seeded Dallas Cowboys are on a first-round bye in the playoffs\u00a0and will face the lowest NFC seed of the victorious teams from this weekend\u2019s wild-card round. The ban does not come as a surprise, as team owner Jerry Jones said he was aware that Gregory may not be available for the postseason. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate,\u201d Jones said Dec. 26. \u201cI\u2019m just saying as excited as I am about Gregory, I want to temper it a little bit.\u201d NFL MVP tracker: Falcons' Matt Ryan decisive winner on final ballot Gregory triggered another failed test in November, the second positive result while he served a previous suspension. Gregory sat a total of 14 games this year in two consecutive suspensions. \u201cThat's outta my ballpark,\u201d Gregory said after his Week 16 season debut in a 42-21 victory against the Detroit Lions. \u201cThere is nothing I can do about it. That type of stuff, I let Jerry, and everyone else, and people like my agent handle it. As we go, we'll find out how everything\u2019s going to turn out. As far as I know, I'm going to go out and play every week and do what I can do to help the team.\u201d In the final two games of the season, Gregory recorded nine tackles and one sack.

Dolphins (10): They're probably a year away from making serious playoff noise, but Adam Gase might finally be the guy who can consistently challenge the Pats.\u00a0 Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports 10. Lions (9): Motown must be encouraged by team's moxie and outlook, even if its margin for error is too narrow to make a first Super Bowl trip viable this year.\u00a0 Tim Fuller, USA TODAY Sports 11. Raiders (11): If they want to check off their next \"first\" since 2002, i.e. a playoff win, couldn't ask for better wild-card opponent than reeling Texans.\u00a0 Ron Chenoy, USA TODAY Sports 12. Buccaneers (12): Second-half surge fell win short of playoffs. But Jameis Winston made history as first QB to throw for 4,000 yards in his first two seasons.\u00a0 Jonathan Dyer, USA TODAY Sports 13.

Broncos (17): Championship-caliber defense should carry over into 2017, but Gary Kubiak's departure only further muddles if offense capable of doing its share.\u00a0 Isaiah J. Downing, USA TODAY Sports 15. Redskins (14): Even assuming QB Kirk Cousins is back next season (and beyond), offense could have decidedly altered look in 2017, which could be good thing.\u00a0 Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports 16. Vikings (25): Some interesting decisions lie ahead -- specifically futures of Adrian Peterson and Sam Bradford -- for team that fell well short of its ceiling.\u00a0 Bruce Kluckhohn, USA TODAY Sports 17.

Colts (19): The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Clearly a course correction needed here.\u00a0 Thomas  J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports 19. Saints (18): The definition of insanity, etc. But why is it so hard for Sean Payton to get defensive help this team needs to complement Drew Brees and Co.\u00a0 Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports 20. Panthers (20): Will the real Cam Newton please stand up? He followed his best season with his worst, making it obvious Carolina's fortunes are tied to him.\u00a0 Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports 21.

Eagles (24): Not a surprise that Doug Pederson is building a team that feels like Kansas City East. But Carson Wentz definitely needs a more reliable weapon.\u00a0 Bill Streicher, USA TODAY Sports 25. Chargers (26): Welp. If they relocate north, Los Angelenos will quickly find Bolts are more worthy of price of admission than their prospective co-tenants.\u00a0 Orlando Jorge Ramirez, USA TODAY Sports 26. Jaguars (27): The flaws are evident, right down to QB Blake Bortles' mechanics. But this still has look of team that could ignite instantly with right coach.\u00a0 Thomas  J.

Again. But high draft picks and major cap space could portend quick revival.\u00a0 Neville E. Guard, USA TODAY Sports 32. Browns (32): Brain trust admits, \"We haven\u2019t established \u2018the guy' \" at QB.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Donald Trump is in a legal battle with celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who pulled out of a plan to open a restaurant at the Trump International Hotel, built inside the historic Old Post Office in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump sat for a deposition on Thursday in a civil lawsuit related to his hotel in the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed to NPR via email. Even as Trump prepares to assume the presidency, he continues to have entanglements related to his wide-ranging business dealings. Jared Kushner And The Anti-Nepotism Statute That Might Keep Him From The White House A source close to the case confirms the videotaped deposition took place at Trump Tower in New York and lasted 90 minutes. The $10 million civil lawsuit, for breach of contract, was filed by Trump's lawyers in August 2015 against celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s' restaurant group, Think Food Group. Andr\u00e9s pulled out of a plan to open an upscale restaurant at the hotel after then-candidate Trump disparaged Mexican immigrants. Think Food Group also countersued for $8 million. In countersuing, the restaurant group argued that Trump's comments were hurting business: \"The perception that Mr. Trump's statements were anti-Hispanic made it very difficult to recruit appropriate staff for a Hispanic restaurant, to attract the requisite number of Hispanic food patrons for a profitable enterprise, and to raise capital for what was now an extraordinarily risky Spanish restaurant.\" Trump's lawyers had tried to avoid the deposition, arguing the president-elect was \"extremely busy handling matters of very significant public importance.\" But last week the judge in the case ordered Trump to sit for the deposition before the end of this week. While the civil case has dragged on for months, as recently as Thursday morning Andr\u00e9s tweeted an offer to Trump for a way to settle the dispute. Again  Mr. Peotus @realDonaldTrump if you are awake, let's resolve this in a friendly way. We donate $ to a charity, \uf91d\uf600..? Is a great deal! \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) January 5, 2017 A number of lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain outstanding and are unlikely to be resolved before he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. That could mean having a president in office who is subject to ongoing litigation, a potential major distraction for the leader of the free world. There is a pretrial hearing scheduled for May 17 in a case against another celebrity chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, who pulled out of a restaurant project in the Old Post Office as well. Article continues after sponsorship Ethics Expert: Trump's Efforts To Address Conflicts Are 'Baby Steps' Andr\u00e9s endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton during the campaign and called on Trump to apologize to Mexicans and every \"person he has insulted.\" Zakarian told the Village Voice in November that he nixed the project \"because my buddy Donald, he f***** up. He opened his f****** mouth.\" NPR's Peter Overby wrote in more detail about both cases late last year. Despite Trump's boasts that he does not settle lawsuits, he has settled several, including a high-profile fraud case against Trump University for $25 million. There's also a question as to whether Trump can hold the lease on the Old Post Office building once he becomes president. He doesn't own the building but is leasing it from the federal government. The agreement contains a clause that could prove problematic for Trump: \"No member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\" ",

    "text": "Only Russia's top officials could have authorized campaign data thefts, U.S. intelligence officials testify Top U.S. intelligence officials in Senate hearing say Russian leaders authorized election hacks National Intelligence Director James Clapper and Cyber Command Chief Admiral Mike Rogers were among the intelligence community officials called to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee on cyber threats facing the United States. Jan. 5, 2017. National Intelligence Director James Clapper and Cyber Command Chief Admiral Mike Rogers were among the intelligence community officials called to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee on cyber threats facing the United States. Jan. 5, 2017. Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Senate Republicans broke with the GOP\u2019s incoming president in a nationally televised congressional hearing Thursday, criticizing Donald Trump \u2019s skepticism that hackers backed by Russian intelligence agencies had interfered with the 2016 presidential race. Only one of 14 Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, offered a modest defense of Trump, and he did so by suggesting the president-elect\u2019s promises to boost military spending and production of oil and gas will serve to block Russian ambitions. \u201cThere is some contrary evidence, despite what the media speculates, that perhaps Donald Trump is not the best candidate for Russia,\u201d Cotton said. But as three American spymasters testified that only top leaders in the Kremlin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin , could have authorized complex cyberattacks against a U.S. presidential election, there was little pushback from Republican lawmakers who are highly suspicious of Russian intentions and deeply perplexed by Trump\u2019s repeated praise for Putin. \u201cRussia clearly tried to meddle in our political system, no two ways about it,\u201d said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who has had an on-again, off-again relationship with the incoming president. \u201cEvery American should be alarmed by Russia\u2019s attacks on our nation,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), who led the first congressional hearing on the hacking since the November election. \u201cThere is no national security interest more vital to the United States of America than the ability to hold free and fair elections without foreign interference.\u201d Only Russia's top officials could have authorized campaign data thefts, U.S. intelligence chiefs testify Jan. 5, 2017, 12:19 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration: U.S. intelligence chiefs blame Russian meddling in presidential... (Noah Bierman) Thanks to a series of mocking tweets and taunts, Trump\u2019s relations with the intelligence community has been tense for weeks. After the hearing ended, he signaled plans to give the 17 U.S. spy agencies new leadership. Aides said Trump would name Dan Coats , a former member of the Senate from Indiana, a onetime U.S. ambassador to Germany and a paid lobbyist, as director of national intelligence, the highest post in U.S. spying. If confirmed by the Senate, Coats would face a daunting task as the link between Trump and the intelligence community. He may also need to reconcile his own hawkish views on Russia, and Putin, with Trump\u2019s far friendlier posture toward the Kremlin. Sen. Coats was banned, along with McCain and several other members of Congress and White House officials, from entering Russia in 2014 after the Obama administration slapped economic sanctions on Russia for its annexation of the Crimea region in Ukraine. Coats, who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, would succeed James R. Clapper , a career intelligence officer. Clapper previously had announced plans to resign when President Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. Clapper took careful note of Trump\u2019s caustic tweets on Thursday, suggesting some were unwarranted. \u201cI think there is an important distinction here between healthy skepticism, which policymakers \u2014 to include policymaker No. 1 \u2014 should always have for intelligence, but I think there's a difference between skepticism and disparagement,\u201d Clapper said. It remains to be seen whether Trump will moderate his doubts or his criticism after he gets a personal briefing Friday on the Russian hacks from a bevy of U.S. intelligence chiefs, including Clapper, CIA Director John O. Brennan \u00a0and James B. Comey, head of the FBI. They are scheduled to brief Trump in New York about evidence they say confirms the Kremlin approved the hacking and leaking of thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee and from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2019s campaign manager, among other targets, last year. They will be armed with a newly-completed classified report that Clapper said would include details of Russia\u2019s motivations \u2014 including whether the operation was partly intended to help elect Trump, as U.S. officials have said privately. Obama ordered the inter-agency review after Trump repeatedly rejected statements by U.S. intelligence officials about Russia\u2019s role. Aides said Obama was briefed on the findings Thursday. The full report will be given to Congress on Monday. Parts will be declassified and released to the public after that, according to the White House. Intelligence officials will \u201cscrub this report and make as much public as they possibly can,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Thursday. He called the report \u201can unvarnished assessment.\u201d Though Clinton and her aides have said the leaked emails damaged her White House bid, Clapper said he had \u201cno way of gauging\u201d whether the Russian hacks influenced \u201cthe choice the electorate made.\u201d The operation did not involve changing vote tallies, he said. \u201cWhether or not it was an act of war is a very heavy policy call,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think the intelligence community should weigh in on that. I do think it should carry great gravity.\" Asked about his level of confidence that the theft and disclosure of Democratic Party emails was directed by the Russian government and not done by a teenage hacker pecking away in a basement, as Trump has suggested, Clapper responded, \u201cIt\u2019s very high.\u201d Donald Trump is going to accept the notion that Russia hacked Democratic email accounts in an attempt to help his campaign \u2014 and that remains a big if \u2014 it will be partly because Republicans in Congress press him to so. That was clear at Thursday\u2019s hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee... If Donald Trump is going to accept the notion that Russia hacked Democratic email accounts in an attempt to help his campaign \u2014 and that remains a big if \u2014 it will be partly because Republicans in Congress press him to so. That was clear at Thursday\u2019s hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee... (Michael McGough) Once in office, Trump is likely to face intense pressure from Republicans to punish Russia. He also will face demands to do a better job than Obama did at deterring foreign cyberattacks on U.S. targets. Clapper told the panel Thursday that since the election, Russia has continued to use computer hacks, leaks of pilfered material and fake news stories to erode faith in democratic processes and to try to weaken the U.S. government by portraying it as corrupt and dysfunctional. Clapper was joined by Adm. Michael S. Rogers, who heads the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, and Marcel J. Lettre, undersecretary of Defense for intelligence. They provided few new details about the evidence, but were unequivocal in their judgments. \u201cWe assess that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized the recent election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets,\u201d the trio said in a statement. Russia poses \u201ca major threat to U.S. government, military, diplomatic, commercial and critical infrastructure and key resource networks because of its highly advanced offensive cyber program and sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures,\u201d they said.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print September 22, 2015: A veiled Palestinian teacher stands next to children as they queue at a United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA)-run school in Gaza. A recent investigation by the Center for Near East Policy Research found that many of the schools are using texts that are authored by the Palestinian Ministry of Education and its contents not fail to recognize the state of Israel. Students attending United Nations-run schools in the West Bank and Gaza use textbooks that ignore the existence of Israel, according to a new report sure to fuel renewed claims about anti-Semitism within the world body. The schools, which teach mainly Palestinian children, are funded by the UN\u2019s Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and use texts from the Palestinian Ministry of Education. The books convey the ministry's refusal to recognize Israel, as well as the message that holy sites like the Western Wall and the Cave of the Patriarchs are exclusively Muslim sites, according to the report. \"It is despicable that a UN agency is teaching Palestinian children racism and lies about Jews and Israel,\u201d Roz Rothstein, co-founder and CEO of StandWithUs, an international Israel education organization, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThere will be no peace and no justice as long as Palestinian leaders, backed by the UN, continue to deny the history and rights of the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland.\" Use of the textbooks was discovered after an investigation was completed by Arnon Gross, who translated the books, and Ronni Shaked from the Harry Truman Research Institute at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem according to Ynet News . In their translations, the pair discovered that not a single mention is made of the historical connection of Jews to the land of Israel or the city of Jerusalem and that the UNRWA schools also make no mention of Jewish holy sites in their materials. Instead, the textbooks contain learning materials that say that these are all Muslim holy Sites that the Jews are trying to illegitimately control. Children at the schools are also taught to negate the existence of the Hebrew languages, according to the report. One text has a picture of a stamp used during the British Mandate period which has Hebrew, English and Arabic writing. The image of the stamp in the book has been altered to remove all the Hebrew writing. The researchers also discovered that maps accompanying the books contain no reference to the presence of Jews in Israel, with all Jewish cities and towns established after 1948 erased. Tel Aviv is even renamed \"Tel al-Rabia.\" Hillel Neuer, executive director of Geneva-based UN Watch, said that the UNRWA is in breach of a recent agreement with the State Department. \u201cBy teaching hatred and intolerance, UNRWA is in breach of the UN Charter, and of its just-signed agreement for 2017 with the U.S. State Department,\u201d he said in a statement to FoxNews.com. \u201cUNRWA schoolbooks that erase Israel and Jews from the geography and history of the region constitute a gross violation of the neutrality requirements applicable to all humanitarian agencies, and specifically negates provisions of UNRWA\u2019s just-signed agreement for 2017 with the U.S. State Department.\u201d The research into the schools and textbooks was commissioned by the Center for Near East Policy Research, and was published less than two weeks after passage of a UN Security Council resolution declaring construction and settlements in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem illegal. Officials for the UNRWA say that they are following a mandate put in place in the 1950s. \u201cPursuant to a practice agreed by UNESCO and the Host countries in 1954, students in UNRWA schools are taught the curriculum of the Host country, which facilitates refugees\u2019 access to Host country secondary schools and enables them to take state examinations and to transition to upper secondary and university,\u201d Christopher Gunness, of the UNRWA, said in a statement provided to FoxNews.com. \u201cUNRWA does not have a formal role in the development of the PA curriculum, something all governments view as a matter of national sovereignty.\u201d Gunness was careful to also point out that new books for pupils in first through fourth grade were released by the Palestinian Authority and that they are currently under a stringent review before they are circulated to UNRWA schools.

In choosing Coats, he is getting a veteran Washington establishment figure \u2014 a senator, former lobbyist and ambassador to Germany \u2014 with a rare distinction: being banned from Russia. Coats' views on Russia after its annexation of Crimea, and his calls for stronger sanctions as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, landed him and other senators on Russia's banned list. It's a major difference with the president-elect, who has praised Putin and cast doubt on U.S. intelligence conclusions that emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign officials were hacked at the direction of the Russian government.

Our summer vacation in Siberia is a no go \u2014 Senator Dan Coats (@SenDanCoats) March 21, 2014 Coats served as senator from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2011 to this year. (He did not seek re-election in November.) In between Senate stints, Coats served as U.S. ambassador to Germany during the George W. Bush administration and worked as a lobbyist. He was also asked by Bush to help his unsuccessful attempt to win Senate confirmation of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. Article continues after sponsorship Coats has been an outspoken critic of the Russian leader. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Coats wrote President Obama after Russia annexed Crimea in 2013, urging Obama to impose sanctions against a Russian weapons exporter. The senators argued the sanctions \"would send a powerful message to Putin,\" whose foreign policy, they went on, has become \"increasingly belligerent.\" Coats also sponsored an amendment to a Ukrainian aid bill in the Senate that would prohibit the U.S. government from doing any business with the exporter, a company called Rosoboronexport. Such actions, Coats said, \"would require our foreign partners to make a choice between America and Putin.\" In 2014, Coats also called on organizers of soccer's World Cup to move the tournament, scheduled for Russia in 2018, somewhere else. All of which won Coats the honor of being banned from Russia, along with five other lawmakers, including Armed Services Chairman and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, and three Obama administration staff members.

Susan Walsh/AP Former MF Global Chief Executive Jon Corzine will pay a $5 million penalty for his role in the company's collapse, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MF Global collapsed in 2011, and hundreds of millions of dollars in customer money disappeared, as we reported . Under the terms of the settlement , Corzine, who has also served as the governor of New Jersey, is barred from commodity trading and cannot use insurance money to pay the penalty. A statement by the CFTC says the amount of customer money the company run by Corzine mishandled is nearly $1 billion. The former assistant treasurer of MF Global, Edith O'Brien, will pay a $500,000 civil penalty in a separate settlement with the regulatory agency , which was also announced Thursday. Judge: MF Global Customers To Recover All Their Losses As we reported in 2013 , the approximately 26,000 MF Global customers who lost money in the company's collapse were expected to recoup their entire investments in a court deal that freed up funds from other parts of MF Global's parent corporation. Corzine has apologized to customers for the company's collapse, saying at a 2011 congressional hearing: \"I appear at today's hearing with great sadness. My sadness, of course, pales in comparison to the losses and hardships that customers, employees and investors have suffered as a result of MF Global's bankruptcy. Their plight weighs on my mind every day \u2014 every hour.

By Sarah Pulliam Bailey January 5 at 7:00 AM Follow @spulliam People make their way down Main Street in Mount Airy. (Logan Cyrus/for The Washington Post) MOUNT AIRY, N.C. \u2014 From a perch on Main Street, the home town of actor Andy Griffith looks this day like it was plucked right out of the television show that bears his name. And it was. Residents and tourists from far-flung states mill along the thoroughfare, past the quaint low-slung shops made of Mount Airy\u2019s famous white granite and named, like Floyd\u2019s City Barber Shop, for references in \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show,\u201d the folksy comedy set in the idyllic fictional small town of Mayberry that first aired in 1960. And yet even as this city of about 10,000 nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains fills its coffers by selling nostalgia, many of its residents would agree with the now-popular saying \u201cWe\u2019re not in Mayberry anymore.\u201d If only the real Mount Airy, which has experienced decades of economic and social decline, were like the Mayberry facade, muses Mayor David Rowe. If only his city and the rest of America could return to the 1950s again. \u201cNow it\u2019s about secular progressivism, not the values you get out of this book,\u201d like honesty and hard work, said Rowe, 72, jabbing his finger at the leather Bible on his office desk. But as Donald Trump prepares to move into the White House, Rowe and many of his constituents are hoping for a return to the past. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold him to it,\u201d said Brad Thomas, 42, who used to work as an engineer building turbine blades for power plants before his job was moved to Mexico. (The Washington Post) A yearning for an earlier time, especially prevalent in rural American towns and cities like Mount Airy, helped spur white evangelical Christians to vote overwhelmingly for Donald Trump. For these voters, the desire for change also could be viewed as a desire to change back, to what they perceive as a more wholesome and prosperous time, when high-paying manufacturing jobs were plentiful, white Protestants were indisputably in charge and same-sex marriage and the Black Lives Matter movement were unthinkable. Seventy-four percent of white evangelicals believe American culture has mostly changed for the worse since the 1950s \u2014 more than any other group of Americans \u2014 compared with 56 percent of all whites, according to a 2016 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. In sharp contrast, 62 percent of African Americans and 57 percent of Hispanic Americans think the culture has changed for the better, the survey said. With his promise to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d Trump appealed directly to this sense of dispossession, and 81 percent of white evangelicals voted for him, according to exit polls. \u201cYou think back to the 1990s, and conservative Christians could throw around the phrase \u2018moral majority,\u2019 and there was a kernel of truth to that,\u201d said Robert P. Jones, CEO at PRRI and author of \u201c The End of White Christian America .\u201d \u201cEven in 2008, they could say the country is on our side on [same-sex marriage], and that\u2019s changed so quickly in this last decade. The election hit on fundamental questions about what America is and should be.\u201d Tourism isn\u2019t enough A Marine Corps corporal stands with an American flag after the Veterans Day parade in downtown Mount Airy. (Logan Cyrus/for The Washington Post) Scissors the size of gardening shears hang from a coat rack in the mayor\u2019s office. They are reserved for Rowe\u2019s primary job of cutting ribbons, he said, and have been used a lot downtown, where just a few empty storefronts remain on Main Street. An old-fashioned sheriff\u2019s squad car drives tourists for $35, stopping at local favorites and ending at Andy Griffith\u2019s childhood home. Visitors to Surry County spent $116.62 million in 2015, compared with $66 million 12 years ago, according to Jessica Icenhour Roberts, who heads tourism partnerships for the county, whose largest city is Mount Airy. But Mount Airy cannot live on tourism alone, the mayor said. \u201cWe try to live the good old days, but it\u2019s hard,\u201d Rowe said. Just down the street from a bronze statue of Griffith and a museum dedicated to his memory, out of sight of the boutiques selling Norman Rockwell and Thomas Kinkade artwork, sit many dilapidated textile mills that have closed in the past decade. From early 2000 to about 2010, about 9,000 private-sector jobs were lost when factories that made clothes went overseas. Mayor David Rowe poses for a portrait outside of his home in Mount Airy. (Logan Cyrus/for The Washington Post) Just off Main Street in downtown Mount Airy are defunct mills left over from a once-thriving textile industry. (Logan Cyrus/for The Washington Post) Three of the economic pillars symbolized on the city seal \u2014 tobacco leaves, a chair representing furniture makers, a spool of yarn for the textile mills \u2014 are largely relics of the past. Now, granite is really the only thing left, the mayor said. The city is home to the world\u2019s largest open-face granite quarry, which continues to provide a boost to the economy and has earned Mount Airy the moniker of \u201cThe Granite City.\u201d Despite the steady stream of tourists, business owners are still struggling to create new jobs that will attract a younger generation, said Lizzie Morrison, 30, who runs an art studio and is the Main Street coordinator with Mount Airy Downtown. Morrison said the city\u2019s younger residents tend to be socially liberal, while most in the older generations look to the past. That tension makes it harder for someone like her to push for new ideas, she said. \u201cYou deal with a lot of white middle-aged men who might call you \u2018Sweetie\u2019 and belittle you a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to navigate that in a small community in trying to create jobs and be taken seriously.\u201d A group of developers has been working on a project to redevelop an old mill, Morrison said, but the proposal has moved slowly because of resistance from residents. Similarly, Vann McCoy, who runs a whiskey shop called Mayberry Spirits, said that residents recently opposed a traffic roundabout because there is no traffic circle visible on \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show.\u201d Meanwhile, some residents said they are having a hard time finding the kind of skilled manufacturing jobs available in the past. Thomas, who blames the loss of his $75,000-a-year factory job on Obama, now makes $18,000 working in his friend\u2019s gun store and pawnshop. He is hopeful Trump will bring jobs back. A Trump flag hangs inside The Gift Box off Main Street in Mount Airy. (Logan Cyrus/for The Washington Post) His colleague, Dreama Staples, 53, said people are bringing in their prized possessions to sell so they can buy groceries and gas. At 4.8 percent, the unemployment rate in Surry County is similar to the national figure, but Staples said that finding full-time work with benefits is difficult. She said she has grown angry over what she considers government overreach. \u201cWe\u2019re losing control of our freedoms,\u201d Staples said. \u201cThe government was taking away our rights. Taxes are higher, our jobs are gone, and it just feels less Christian.\u201d Memories at odds with facts Many Mount Airy residents applauded the president-elect\u2019s promise to revoke the Johnson Amendment, which effectively bars pastors from endorsing a candidate from the pulpit, Rowe said. They were heartened by his suggestion that Christians will be able to once again see \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d signs in department stores. But the mayor acknowledges that the 1950s and \u201960s were not idyllic for all Americans. He wouldn\u2019t, for example, want to go back to the days when there were separate water fountains at the local Sears for whites and blacks. At the same time, he said, African Americans often bring hardship on themselves. Asked to explain what he meant, he amended the statement to mean young blacks. \u201cWhen you\u2019re my age and you see an African American boy with pants at their knees, you can\u2019t appreciate them,\u201d he said, noting that he would never employ someone who dressed that way. \u201cI\u2019m worried about when a person chooses to dresses like that, what kind of effect will that person have on society.\u201d He noted that the Hispanics he has hired to work at his construction company are hard workers. He doesn\u2019t encounter people who aren\u2019t white in social settings much because folks tend to self-segregate, he said. Mount Airy is 84 percent white, 8.2 percent black and 6.7 percent Hispanic, according to 2010 Census data. Not everyone is nostalgic for the 1950s. Ron Jessup, 68, who grew up in Mount Airy during that era, found the place generally friendly then, he said \u2014 as long as he and other blacks obeyed the racist laws and social mores of the time. If African Americans went to the theater, they sat upstairs, he said. If they went to the restaurants, they avoided the counter. \u201cWe understood what was considered our place,\u201d said Jessup, who is retired from his job as a high school principal in nearby Winston-Salem. Even now, all five Surry County commissioners are white. Fictional Mayberry only represented part of the Mount Airy story because it only portrayed a white America, Jessup said. White residents tend to view the city\u2019s history through rose-colored glasses, he said. Even Andy Griffith said the show wasn\u2019t based on his home town, Jessup noted. Indeed, in a 1998 television interview, Griffith said the idea of Mayberry came from the producers. \u201cI\u2019ve argued about this too long. I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said of people in Mount Airy. \u201cLet them think what they want to think.\u201d Andy Griffith never returned to live in his home town either, dying in 2012 at his coastal home in Dare County. Ironically, when the show first aired in 1960, the intent was to hark back to an even earlier era \u2014 the 1930s, Griffith has said. As for Trump, Jessup believes his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan was code for \u201ctake America back again,\u201d and a reaction to President Obama\u2019s election. \u201cSometimes we use Christianity when it\u2019s convenient for what we want,\u201d Jessup said. \u201cYou can\u2019t allow someone to have racist remarks and then go to church and talk about Jesus as the center of your life.\u201d God and country White Plains Baptist Church Pastor David Tucker and his wife, Thresa, stand in the front of the sanctuary. A painting can be seen above their baptismal pool. (Logan Cyrus/for The Washington Post) When she travels with her pastor husband, Thresa Tucker hands out an evangelistic tract that uses \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\u201d as an entry point for talking about Jesus. When they return home to Mount Airy, she said, she is reminded of how good they have it, pointing out the red barns that dot views of the Blue Ridge. Tucker and her husband, David, said they voted for Trump because they want a more limited federal government. They mentioned social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage and school prayer. The Tuckers were also dismayed when their health insurance bill skyrocketed. Before Obamacare, they had no health insurance and paid out of pocket. Their monthly bill will rise from $115 a month now to $435 next year, Thresa Tucker said. Many of those who have lost jobs seek help at White Plains Baptist Church, where her husband is preacher. But not all who seek help are worthy of it, she said. The church has to be a good steward of its money, so there are criteria for assistance, and she asks whether people attend church regularly. African Americans who have voiced concerns over what Trump will do for the poor would have a different perspective if they tried harder to help themselves, she said. \u201cI think black people think they\u2019re owed something,\u201d she said. \u201cI think if they acted differently people would be apt to help them.\u201d She later added that some white people expect handouts, too. \u201cI believe Trump will get people back to working,\u201d she said. David Tucker said people resent it when the government tries to supplant the role of local ministries in helping those in need. \u201cDon\u2019t try to change us into something like New York,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we really want is for the government to leave us alone and to worship the way we want to.\u201d Nostalgia for Christian America John Eaton, from Flat Rock, N.C., holds up a sign on the corner of Pine and Main streets in downtown Mount Airy. (Logan Cyrus/for The Washington Post) After settling into a bright blue booth at Olympia Family Restaurant, Rowe said he has a lot to be thankful for. He has a good job, a wife, two kids, one grandchild and another on the way. He has a beautiful home near the country club with a view of the mountains. But he notes that while his home town looks picturesque from the outside, it has faced some of the same issues as urban areas, including drugs and divorce. Things might have turned out differently if religion had maintained its role in the culture, he suggested. People just aren\u2019t committed to church, anymore, he said. The church he attends used to attract up to 600 people on a Sunday in the 1960s, but is lucky to get a third of that now. Young people leave for college and come back with more progressive, secular values, he said. Even so, as the man he voted for is about to take office, Rowe is a bit wary. For one thing, he said, he does not want to have to defend Trump for the next four years. \u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything while being a mayor,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to think before you speak. I\u2019m not sure Donald Trump has learned that.\u201d If Trump does manage to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d Rowe said it will involve preventing the government from encroaching on religion. Christianity has come under attack in America, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s subtle, not in your face, but that\u2019s the way Satan works,\u201d he said. An earlier version of this story misstated the year of the PRRI survey. This version has been corrected. local ",

The video, which has since been taken down, appears to show the torture and taunting of a white special needs man. USA TODAY NETWORK Chicago police charged four teens Jan. 5, 2017, with hates crimes and other felonies in connection with the alleged assault and torture of a special needs teenager that was streamed on Facebook Live. The four suspects: Far left, Brittany Covington, 18, of Chicago. Right, top to bottom: Jordan Hill, 18, of Carpentersville, Ill.; Tanishia Covington, 24, Chicago, and Tesfaye Cooper, 18, of Chicago. (Photo: Chicago Police Dept. via Twitter) Four young African-Americans\u00a0were charged with hate crimes and other felonies \u00a0in Chicago on Thursday for allegedly tying up, beating and torturing\u00a0a white acquaintance \u2014 a\u00a0special needs student \u2014 and livestreaming the assault on Facebook. The\u00a0half-hour video, which exploded on social media\u00a0Wednesday,\u00a0appears to show at least one black man torturing and taunting the 18-year-old\u00a0victim\u00a0and making disparaging remarks about President-elect Donald Trump. Authorities said the victim was a friend of one of the suspects, Jordan Hill, 18, \u00a0and\u00a0the pair spent a day and night driving around Chicago in a stolen van before ending up at a\u00a0West Side apartment, where two sisters, Brittany and Tanishia Covington, lived. Hill allegedly tied up the victim and began a methodical, five-hour assault on him Tuesday after\u00a0playful fighting turned ugly, police said. \"They (the female suspects) got aggravated with him, and that is when he was tied up and the racial slurs, the deferences to his mental capacity started coming out,\" said\u00a0Police Cmdr. Kevin Duffin. \"That is primarily why they are charged with a hate crime.\" The Cook County prosecutors office charged Hill, of Carpentersville, Ill., along with Tesfaye Cooper, 18, Brittany Covington, 18, \u00a0and Tanishia Covington, 24, all\u00a0of Chicago, with\u00a0aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and residential burglary.\u00a0Hill was also charged with robbery and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. Duffin said the suspects told police\u00a0they beat the victim, kicked him\u00a0and made him drink toilet water. The video also shows his scalp\u00a0being cut by a knife. Police said the incident came to a head after a downstairs\u00a0neighbor threatened to report them over the noise. The sisters, angered by the\u00a0threat, went downstairs and kicked in the\u00a0neighbor's door, giving the victim a chance to escape. He was spotted by police Tuesday afternoon walking along a sidewalk in\u00a0cold weather wearing only sandals,\u00a0jeans\u00a0shorts and a tank top\u00a0turned inside\u00a0out and backward. \"He was bloodied, he was battered,\" said officer Michael Donnelly, who came upon the victim. \"He was very discombobulated, he was injured, he was confused.\" Donnelly said a check showed that the victim had been reported missing by his parents, who dropped him off at a McDonald's Saturday in the Chicago suburb of Streamwood to spend the night with Hill.\u00a0At one point, the parents told police they began\u00a0getting text messages from someone claiming to be holding him captive and alerted police. In announcing the charges,\u00a0Chicago \u00a0Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson called the actions in the video \"reprehensible.\" \u00a0He indicated that the hate crime\u00a0charges were based on racial comments and disparaging comments made by the suspects regarding\u00a0the victim's mental condition. The video,\u00a0 linked\u00a0here , includes raw language. At one point, as the victim crouches against a wall with his\u00a0wrists\u00a0bound and his mouth\u00a0taped shut, someone is heard on the video shouting, \u201cF\u2011\u2011\u2011 Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cF\u2011\u2011\u2011 white people.\u201d The four were expected to appear in court on Friday. A man is shown in a Facebook Live video that was streamed of a victim allegedly being tortured. \u00a0(Photo: Facebook Live) Law Center: Hate crime activity has declined since election The video was initially posted via Facebook Live under the account of someone named Brittany Herring and spread quickly through\u00a0Twitter\u00a0under the hashtag #BLMKidnapping. BLM is an apparent reference to the social justice group Black Lives Matter, which did not appear to have any connection to the video. Facebook has confirmed that it removed the\u00a0original video from one of the suspect's Facebook profiles as part of their policy banning the celebration or glorification of crimes. Police said in a statement that the victim, who is\u00a0from a Chicago suburb,\u00a0was in stable condition. Johnson said the victim has \"mental health challenges.\" ",

The National Weather Service on Thursday issued a winter storm warning beginning Friday afternoon for the northern two-thirds of Georgia, clipping the northwestern tip of South Carolina stretching through nearly the entire length of North Carolina. Metropolitan Atlanta could get as much as a half-foot of snow by Saturday morning, the weather service said. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal pre-emptively declared a state of emergency as authorities advised residents of the entire northern half of the state to lay in enough food and water to last at least three days. \"We're looking at a significant event,\" said Sue Loeffler, director of the state Emergency Management Agency. \"Go to the grocery store now.\" Grocery store mayhem. It might snow a little tomorrow. https://t.co/hl4mLCNnLV pic.twitter.com/DmoeXqWGm1 \u2014 Tripp Crosby (@trippcrosby) January 5, 2017 Michael Thurmond, chief executive of DeKalb County in metro Atlanta, warned residents: \"This can potentially be a historic weather event.\" The state may have caught a break: The snow isn't expected to begin until Friday night \u2014 after Atlanta's notorious traffic has had time to clear \u2014 lessening the potential for a repeat of Snow Jam 2014 , when thousands of motorists were hopelessly stranded without food and water on interstates during a paralyzing winter storm three years ago. \"We do feel fortunate that it's coming in on a Friday night, where we will have the weekend to really address the roads,\" said Alan Chapman, director of the Transportation Department in suburban Gwinnett County. Street maintenance crews prepare for what's expected to be long weekend duty in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Tim Barber / AP Snow was already falling over Tennessee, Kentucky and parts north, but it's when warm, wet air from the Gulf Mexico beginnings moving ashore on Friday that the real chaos is expected to begin, the National Weather Service said. \"The heavy snow will make many roads impassable and may produce widespread power outages due to the weight of the snow on tree limbs and power lines,\" the weather service said in a revised forecast late Thursday afternoon. Four to 6 inches of snow may not sound like much to residents in the western third of the country, which was still being belted by record snow as high as 15 feet. Related: Massive Winter Weather System Brings 'Epic' Snowfall to Sierra Nevada But the witches' brew of rain, sleet and snow in the South will be occurring with temperatures just below and at freezing \u2014 meaning there's a strong likelihood of a thawing-and-refreezing cycle that could coat the region in a deadly film of solid ice. A forecast map shows expected snow levels Saturday morning across the South. National Weather Service Freezing rain is \"the big story here,\" said Kait Parker, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel . \"That's a huge concern for us because that is the most dangerous and deadly type of winter weather.\" The National Weather Service predicted conditions that even it called seemingly implausible in North Carolina, where Gov.-elect Roy Cooper canceled most of the weekend's inauguration ceremonies in Raleigh, including the traditional inaugural parade. A couple of important announcements on the Inauguration: the Inaugural Parade on Saturday is cancelled due to inclement weather. \u2014 Roy Cooper (@RoyCooperNC) January 4, 2017 The heaviest snow is expected north of a line along Interstate 64 from Chatham County through Raleigh and Rocky Mount, forecasters said. South and east of that line will get a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. \"So counter-intuitively, this area could see a reduction in snowfall totals but an increase in potential impacts due to very poor travel conditions as a result of the possible freezing rain,\" the weather service said.

RAN OUT OF CARTS. #snOMG #CLTwx \u2014 Alli (@AlliFitz) January 5, 2017 The North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro said it will be closed all weekend for the safety and welfare of its animals and guests alike.\" At Burke Brothers Hardware in Raleigh, the state capital, frantic shoppers have \"cleaned us out more or less so far,\" Jeff Hastings, an employee at the store, told NBC station WRAL . Stuart Davis, who works at Briggs Hardware in Raleigh agreed that the snow will be \"good for business.\" All day Thursday, people have been calling \"asking if we have sleds, ice melt and snow shovels,\" he told the station. Meanwhile, in Clemson, South Carolina, the folks in charge of Clemson University's marching band were huddling Thursday to figure whether and how the band will make it to Tampa, Florida, for the Tigers' college football national championship game Monday against the University of Alabama. The band is making the 575-mile journey by in buses able to accommodate all of its instruments and equipment. It was scheduled to depart on Saturday. \"I want to be absolutely safe, doing the right thing,\" Mark Spede, director of the Tiger Band, told NBC station WYFF of Greenville. \"So it's just a little bit of added stress that I wish I didn't have right now.\" Alex Johnson ",

The group, called DCMJ, has announced its plans to hand out upward of 4,200 marijuana cigarettes near Dupont Circle the morning of Donald Trump 's inauguration and then march toward the National Mall. If you can guess how many joints are in these bags, you might get a free one at #Trump420 ! https://t.co/tacfhl6pFS pic.twitter.com/guaOlRUVoG \u2014 DCMJ (@DCMJ2014) January 4, 2017 It is legal to possess a small amount of marijuana in the District of Columbia but illegal to smoke it in public. DCMJ's leader, Adam Eidinger, told ABC News its members will be giving away the joints, which is legal. They will not tell people to break the law by smoking in public. But, he added, he thought the idea of smoking them publicly would be \"a great act of civil disobedience in light of the silence [on marijuana reform] coming from the Trump administration.\" \"We would love not to do this,\" Eidinger said. \"We feel compelled to do it, and if we heard any sign from Donald Trump that he was serious about reform and Jeff Sessions was serious about reform ... we would call it off.\" The group is strongly opposed to Trump's selection of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., for attorney general, since Sessions has been an outspoken opponent of marijuana. At a Senate hearing in April 2016, Sessions said that \"good people don't smoke marijuana\" and it is \"not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized.\" The Metropolitan Police Department is \"aware of the situation and monitoring it,\" said its public relations spokeswoman Karimah Bilal. She said that anyone caught smoking marijuana in public could receive a citation, which could include a fine, typically $25, or be summoned to court. Eidinger told ABC News that he has offered to pay the fine for anyone who is arrested as a result of the group's plans, but he said he expects police are \"going to take a tolerance policy.\" The group is calling on supporters and marijuana enthusiasts to meet outside Dupont Circle \u2014 as opposed to in the park at the center of the circle, since that is federally owned land \u2014 as early as 7:00 a.m. on Friday, Jan. 20, for coffee and tea and to distribute the joints. \"We're not judging people who come and get weed and go home and watch the inauguration,\" Eidinger said. Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP Images Adam Eidinger, far right, and a few other members of the Washington, DC marijuana rights group DCMJ wait in the Capitol Hill office of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Nov. 28, 2016. The group plans to work within the confines of D.C. law, it said. It is asking supporters to arrive with up to 2 ounces each of prepared joints to distribute \u2014 but no more. Group members plan to hold rolling parties in preparation for the big day and, Eidinger said, participants will take home what they roll and distribute it on Inauguration Day. When they give out joints that morning, they will be checking IDs to make sure that all recipients are at least 21 years old, as mandated by the district's law. \"We're going to show the public how it can be done safely without giving it away to kids,\" he said. So far, Eidinger said, he has 25 people committed to distributing the joints on Inauguration Day and, based on his group's previous rallies and events, he is prepared for a much larger turnout \u2014 as many as 5,000 people. \"We'll run out,\" he said. Even if the recipients go back to their homes to smoke and then return for the inauguration, rather than smoke in public, he said, it will still be a presence. \"You will smell it, and it should be really interesting to see how it goes down,\" Eidinger said. The inauguration is not the only upcoming political event that DCMJ plans to attend. Eidinger said members will be \"sitting in line for three days\" to make sure that they get seats in the audience for Session's confirmation hearing, which is scheduled for Jan. 10 and 11. \"It's going to smell like marijuana in that hearing because we smell like marijuana because we're going to smoke legally before it,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

Radio host Glenn Beck speaks during a Tea Party rally on Sept. 9, 2015, on\u00a0the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington against the Iran deal. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A depraved attack on a mentally disabled white teen broadcast live on Facebook allegedly by four black Chicago-area residents became a national rallying cry Thursday for conservative pundits who tried to pin the blame \u2014 without evidence \u2014 for the attack on the Black Lives Matters movement. Shown repeatedly on cable TV and shared tens of thousands of times online, the grotesque video of the 18-year-old being cut with a knife in the scalp and forced to drink toilet water led familiar right wing talking heads including Glenn Beck , Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and others to call for increased charges and to find fault with what they characterized as excessively permissive policing. (William Lee) Beck urged his 1.1 million Twitter followers to \"Stand up with me and demand justice in Chicago for the beating of a disabled trump supporter by BLM ,\" also accusing the media of \"blindly encouraging\" similar crimes. Clarke, appearing on Sean Hannity's Fox News show Wednesday, cited the case as evidence that \"Rahm Emanuel has allowed Black Lives Matter and the ACLU to run the Chicago Police Department.\" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News, \"If this had been done to an African American by four whites, every liberal in the country would be outraged, and there'd be no question but that it's a hate crime.\" Beating of disabled teen captured on Facebook Live Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man.

(Warning: Contains graphic content) See more videos And after Chicago Police, who are under a federal investigation of their policies and practices following their shooting of black teen Laquan McDonald, later Thursday charged four defendants with a hate crime, conservative author Mike Cernovich took a victory lap, telling his 185,000 followers that their activism had led to the charges. \"Sorry you are a loser with no impact,\" Cernovich tweeted at an opponent who dared suggest that the case would have been charged as a hate crime without the conservative outcry. The attacker's shouts of \"F\u2011\u2011\u2011 Donald Trump \" and \"F\u2011\u2011\u2011 white people\" on the filmed attack convinced many on the right that the attack was motivated by the Black Lives Matter movement, though Chicago Police spokesman Frank Giancamilli said Thursday they had found \"no indication that it's linked to any specific group,\" and another police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said investigators believe the man was targeted because he had special needs, not because he was white. Black Lives Matter Chicago tweeted Thursday that \"BLM doesn't condone violence and we are abhorred by this travesty. We hope he's well & receiving care.\" In another tweet, it added, \"In the mainstream imagination of today, anything horrible done by Black people will be associated with BLM. Funny how oppression works.\" kjanssen@chicagotribune.com ",

A decade later, the same office seeks to toss his conviction Raymond Lee Jennings, right, wipes away tears during a hearing where Judge Wiiliam Ryan declined to vacate Jennings'conviction. Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times Raymond Lee Jennings, right, wipes away tears during a hearing in which Judge William Ryan said he needed more time to decide whether to vacate Jennings'conviction. Raymond Lee Jennings, right, wipes away tears during a hearing in which Judge William Ryan said he needed more time to decide whether to vacate Jennings'conviction. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) Marisa Gerber and Richard Winton Contact Reporters From behind bars, Raymond Lee Jennings begged a judge to throw out his murder conviction. He\u2019d been in the dimly lit Palmdale parking that winter night\u00a0as a security guard, but he swore he had nothing to do with killing 18-year-old Michelle O\u2019Keefe. Now \u2014\u00a0more than a decade after his arrest \u2014 he has a surprise ally in his\u00a0request to drop the case: The same district attorney\u2019s office that prosecuted him. In a\u00a0letter filed in\u00a0court this week, Los Angeles County prosecutors said they agree\u00a0the conviction should be tossed out \u201cbased on newly discovered evidence pointing to his factual innocence.\u201d \u201cIt's finally come to an end,\u201d Jennings said after a court hearing Thursday.\u00a0\u201cA bit of elation, a bit of sadness.\u201d Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of all he\u2019d missed during his\u00a011 years behind bars \u2014 \u00a0mainly watching his five children grow up.\u00a0At times, he said, he felt like giving up. What\u2019s the\u00a0point, he wondered? He had been sentenced to 40 years to life in prison. He could keep calling them and writing letters,\u00a0but he hated the idea of never making memories with them. \u201c\u2018Excruciating\u2019 is the word for it,\u201d he said. Even now he sees the impact of his time away on his relationship with his kids \u2014\u00a0a\u00a0certain disconnect, he said. As Jennings walked slowly\u00a0into a downtown L.A. courtroom Thursday, he wore a black suit and a broad smile. From a few feet away, the victim\u2019s mother winced. When Patricia O\u2019Keefe\u00a0addressed the court, she spoke of her\u00a0daughter as a little baby with a full head of black hair, who grew into a woman who treated everyone with kindness. As for Jennings \u2014\u00a0whom she\u00a0referred\u00a0to\u00a0only by his last name \u2014 she told Superior Court Judge William Ryan that\u00a0she hadn\u2019t changed her mind.\u00a0 \u201cJennings\u00a0is still guilty until proven otherwise,\u201d she said. When the victim\u2019s father\u00a0spoke, he sometimes sighed and his voice cracked:\u00a0\u201cJudge Ryan, I don\u2019t have to tell you how big this decision is.\u201d\u00a0 Michael O\u2019Keefe\u00a0brought up\u00a0the original prosecutor\u2019s trial argument:\u00a0that Jennings seemed to know too many details about the shooting for someone who wasn\u2019t guilty. He urged the judge to speak with the trial prosecutor and review an appellate court\u00a0decision from years earlier that upheld\u00a0Jennings\u2019 conviction. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d the father said, \u201cnothing has changed in my mind.\u201d He went on to tell the judge of the tremendous loss he\u2019s suffered over the years \u2014 \u00a0after Michelle\u2019s death, his\u00a0son died of a\u00a0drug overdose. Ryan nodded sympathetically. \u201cThink about our daughter. Think about an innocent girl killed 17 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m relying on you to make the right decision.\u201d As the parents spoke, Jennings stared ahead, swiveling slightly in his chair and resting his chin on his two index fingers. Ryan said he plans to issue a written ruling later on whether to throw out the conviction. (Richard Winton) The teenage victim was shot to death inside her blue Ford Mustang in February 2000.\u00a0The case remained unsolved for several years, stoking fear in the Antelope Valley \u2014 O\u2019Keefe\u2019s\u00a0picture adorned a billboard\u00a0along with the message, \u201cCan you help catch my killer?\u201d In December 2005 \u2014 after initially deciding\u00a0there wasn\u2019t enough evidence against him \u2014\u00a0prosecutors charged Jennings. The\u00a0prosecutor who took the case to trial characterized the slaying as a sexual advance gone awry, pointing to the $111 found inside O\u2019Keefe\u2019s wallet\u00a0as proof it wasn\u2019t a botched robbery. In interviews with detectives and lawyers,\u00a0Jennings knew things that only the killer would know, the prosecutor argued. There was no forensic evidence directly connecting Jennings to the crime. Two downtown L.A. juries deadlocked before the case was ultimately moved back to the Antelope Valley for a third trial. Jurors there convicted Jennings in 2009. But\u00a0he always maintained his innocence, even at his sentencing in 2010. \u201cThis is one sin that I will not be judged for,\u201d he told the judge. \u201cI\u2019m at peace in my life, and I laugh and I smile because I hold no remorse.\u201d Jennings continued to fight for his freedom until June 2016, when the district attorney\u2019s office sent a letter to the court under seal that said newly discovered evidence raised doubts about his guilt. At the request of prosecutors, Ryan ordered Jennings released but did not throw out the conviction. On Thursday, the judge unsealed the letter, which said that other people who had been in the parking lot that night had previously committed similar crimes using handguns. They fled before authorities arrived, wrote Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. John Spillane. The newly discovered evidence, Spillane wrote, suggests that O\u2019Keefe\u00a0\u201cmay have been killed by gang members during a robbery.\u201d The letter did not name the possible suspects, citing the ongoing inquiry, but said a 17-year-old woman was in a rented Chevy Malibu in the parking lot that night with at least two others. A\u00a0documented gang member, she went on to be convicted of possession of a firearm and was later arrested for throwing bleach in her boyfriend\u2019s face, the letter said.\u00a0 In 2015, she was accused of more violence: stabbing a boyfriend. She was charged with attempted murder but convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, and was sentenced to five years in prison. An 18-year-old gang member who was with her in the car on the night of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s killing committed a home invasion robbery and carjacking just months later, according to the letter. He was caught after stealing a Mustang. At the time of his arrest, he was wearing an earring with a white stone that was similar to others O\u2019Keefe was wearing the night she was killed. The man is serving a 31-year prison sentence. Deputy Dist. Atty. Bobby Grace of the district attorney\u2019s conviction review unit\u00a0said a\u00a0prosecutor from the hardcore gang\u00a0division, along\u00a0with two sheriff\u2019s detectives, are now conducting a new investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s killing. They\u2019ve uncovered new information since June, Grace said, noting that the O\u2019Keefe family has not been briefed on the findings. \u201cIt is important to note,\u201d Grace said,\u00a0\u201cthat no new information that has been gathered points to Ray Jennings.\u201d Grace said the district attorney\u2019s\u00a0office is\u00a0willing\u00a0\u201cto tweak things\u201d based on lessons learned from the case. In a court filing this week, Jennings\u2019\u00a0appellate attorney,\u00a0Jeffrey Ehrlich,\u00a0asked Ryan to throw out\u00a0the conviction, saying the original investigators and prosecutors developed \u201ctunnel vision\u201d and\u00a0\u201cconcocted a flimsy case.\u201d Ehrlich added: \u201cRay Jennings\u00a0lost 11 years of his life as a result.\u201d The original trial prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Blake, through a spokesperson declined to comment. In his filing, Ehrlich included a report from Peter Klismet, a\u00a0retired FBI\u00a0profiler who reviewed the case for the defense. Detectives, Klismet said, homed \u201cin on Jennings, developed the theory that he was the killer, and then built a set of facts around Jennings rather than consider other, more viable suspects. It appears Jennings became the only suspect in their minds, and they made the facts fit that theory, while there were other options available.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The deadliest fire in a decade has focused new attention on Ghost Ship warehouse owner Chor Ng , Congress is holding its first hearing today on the Russian\u00a0cyberattacks during the presidential election , Aerospace firms are stepping up competition with Silicon Valley for young engineers \u00a0and\u00a0 if Amazon\u2019s Alexa is always listening, can she incriminate you in a crime?

    "text": "State Department Designates Osama bin Laden's Son a 'Global Terrorist' By Elizabeth McLaughlin Jan 5, 2017, 1:10 PM ET 0 Shares Star AP Photo In this April 1998 file photo, al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is seen in Afghanistan. 0 Shares Email The State Department designated Osama bin Laden \u2019s son, Hamza bin Laden, a \u201cSpecially Designated Global Terrorist\u201d on Thursday. Bin Laden, born in 1989, was announced as an official member of al-Qaida, the terrorist group his father founded, in 2015. Since then, al-Qaida audio messages featuring the younger bin Laden have threatened the U.S. and western nations and called for attacks against U.S., French and Israeli interests in Washington, D.C., Paris, France, and Tel Aviv, Israel. A July message from him threatened revenge against Americans in the U.S. and abroad. The designation of a \u201cSpecially Designated Global Terrorist\u201d imposes sanctions on the individual via Executive Order 13224, a tool the State Department called \u201cpowerful.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s action notifies the U.S. public and the international community that Hamza bin Laden is actively engaged in terrorism,\u201d the State Department said in a press release. \u201cDesignations of terrorist individuals and groups expose and isolate organizations and individuals, and result in denial of access to the U.S. financial system. Moreover, designations can assist or complement the law enforcement actions of other U.S. agencies and other governments.\u201d The State Department also imposed this designation on Ibrahim al-Banna, a senior member of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Al-Banna is subject to a U.S. government reward of up to $5 million. Hamza bin Laden is only the second of Osama bin Laden\u2019s 20-plus children to be sanctioned by the U.S., according to a list compiled by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In January 2009, the Treasury Department designated Sa'ad bin Laden for being involved in al-Qaida activities. It was reported that Sa\u2019ad bin Laden would ultimately take over al-Qaida from his father, but he was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2009. In 2011, U.S. Navy SEALs raided Osama bin Laden\u2019s Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound, killing the al-Qaida leader who orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Letters taken from the compound showed he was grooming his son Hamza bin Laden to run the group following Sa'ad bin Laden's death. The State Department press release did not give an indication as to where Hamza bin Laden is located. An image from 2001 appears to show Hamza bin Laden (center) as a young boy reading a poem alongside Taliban members in Afghanistan. Another image from that time shows him holding what the Taliban claimed was a piece of a U.S. helicopter. AL-JAZEERA/Handout/AFP/Getty Images This file frame grab photo taken on, Nov. 7, 2001, shows Hamza, who appears to be the youngest son of Saudi born Osama bin Laden, as he recites a poem, in this frame grab taken from the Qatar based al-Jazeera satellite news channel. Al-Jazeera via APTN/AP Photo In this image made from video broadcast by the Qatari-based satellite television station Al-Jazeera, Nov. 7, 2001, a young boy, left, identified as Hamza bin Laden. Currently leading al-Qaida is Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was allegedly involved in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya. The State Department is offering up to $25 million for information leading to al-Zawahiri\u2019s capture. The only other individual who commands a reward that large is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS. 0 Shares ",
