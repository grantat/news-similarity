    "text": "Play Bob Gathany, The Huntsville Times/AP Photo WATCH Gates: 'Big Mistake' to Push Key Intelligence, Military Leaders Out of Security Council Principals Committee 0 Shares Email Former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Robert Gates called it \"a big mistake\" by President Trump to downgrade the status of the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the National Security Council, limiting which council meetings the two leaders can attend. Trump made the change to the National Security Council in an executive memorandum Saturday that also gave the president's controversial senior adviser and chief strategist Stephen Bannon a seat at the council's Principals Committee meetings. \u201cMy biggest concern is there are actually, under the law, two statutory advisers to the National Security Council, and that's the director of [national] intelligence, or the DNI, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,\" Gates told ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz on \u201cThis Week.\u201d \"They both bring a perspective and judgment and experience \u2026 that every president -- whether they like it or not -- finds useful.\u201d According to Saturday\u2019s memo outlining the changes, both leaders will now only attend NSC Principals Committee meetings \"where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\" \u201cPushing them out of the National Security Council [Principals] meetings except when their specific issues are at stake is a big mistake,\u201d said Gates, who served as Defense Secretary for both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. As for Bannon, Trump\u2019s controversial adviser and the former publisher of Breitbart News , Gates said that adding people to National Security Council meetings \u201cnever really bothers me.\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended giving Bannon a seat at the Principals meetings, saying the chief strategist's role is going to be \"crucial,\u201d adding that Bannon is a former Naval officer who has \u201ca tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now.\u201d \"Having the chief strategist for the president in those meetings who has a significant military background to help make -- guide what the president's final analysis is going to be is crucial,\" Spicer said on \"This Week.\" Donald Trump Says He'll Give Christian Refugees Priority President Obama\u2019s former national security adviser Susan Rice responded to the National Security Council changes this morning, calling it \u201cstone cold crazy.\" This is stone cold crazy. After a week of crazy. Who needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK? https://t.co/Mmyc139w3M \u2014 Susan Rice (@AmbassadorRice) January 29, 2017 Chairman of Joint Chiefs and DNI treated as after thoughts in Cabinet level principals meetings. And where is CIA?? Cut out of everything? \u2014 Susan Rice (@AmbassadorRice) January 29, 2017 \u201cThat's clearly inappropriate language from a former ambassador,\u201d Spicer responded on \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWe are instilling reforms to make sure that we streamline the process for the president to make decisions on key, important intelligence matters,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat they have done is modernize the National Security Council so that it is less bureaucratic and more focused on providing the president with the intelligence he needs.\u201d Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story indicated that under the president's signed memorandum, the director of national intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be limited in attending National Security Council meetings. As Martha Raddatz stated on \"This Week,\" it is the National Security Council Principals Committee meetings to which their attendance will be limited. In addition, White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon now also has a seat at National Security Council Principals Committee meetings. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Email LOS ANGELES -- Investigators used a controversial DNA testing method to solve the decades-old killing of the ex-wife of Righteous Brothers singer Bill Medley, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said. Karen Klaas was attacked Jan. 30, 1976 as she returned to her home in Hermosa Beach. The 32-year-old was sexually assaulted, strangled with her pantyhose and never regained consciousness. She died a few days later at the hospital. The sheriff\u2019s department said Friday that the case \u201cwas solved through the use of familial DNA, which identified the killer,\u201d but provided no other details. The technique, which has raised ethical issues in the forensics community, allows investigators to search law enforcement databases to identify likely relatives of the person who may have committed the crime. Law enforcement officials have argued the technique can provide valuable leads to investigators. A sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman would not say Friday evening whether investigators had formally made an arrest in the case and declined to identify the suspect. Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell, District Attorney Jackie Lacey and other officials are expected to release additional information at a news conference Monday. Sheriff\u2019s investigators, seeking help from the public in 2009, said two witnesses spotted a shaggy-haired, bearded man in a trench coat and blue jeans leaving the house, but the man was never seen again. Officials said they were able to cull together a DNA profile of Klaas\u2019 killer but in 2009 said it hadn\u2019t matched anyone in the national DNA database. CBS Los Angeles reports that more details about how exactly the case was solved will be revealed at a news conference Monday at the Hall of Justice in downtown Los Angeles. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Demonstrators lined Pennsylvania Avenue and packed Lafayette Square as the protest commenced about 1 p.m. Revelers cycled through a variety of chants, and wielded poster boards bearing messages such as \"Islamophobia is un-American\" and \"Dissent is patriotic.\" \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here! ... No hate! No fear! Refugees are welcome here!\" they chanted. \"No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace!\" The White House protest was one of several nationwide, including Boston, and at more than 30 U.S. airports. There also were plans for demonstrations in the United Kingdom. The travel ban bars entry into the United States from seven predominately Muslim countries. Despite a federal judge's ruling late Saturday night, and similar court decisions with varying degrees of power, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement Sunday that said the agency would continue to implement the travel rule. At Dulles International Airport , hundreds of peaceful demonstrators sang the \"National Anthem\" and created a cheering gauntlet for travelers emerging from customs. (Jerry Markon, Katherine Shaver) The crowd yelled \"Let them in!\" and \"Welcome!\" as passengers, including some from majority-Muslim countries, rolled their suitcases through gray doors and into an airport that had become a makeshift law office and civics classroom in response to Trump's executive order. \"My kids go to school with people from everywhere,\" said Sasha Moreno, of Reston, Virginia, whose six-year-old daughter drew a little red statue of liberty on poster board along with the message: \"Welcome to America.\" Her daughter's kindergarten class includes many students from Sudan, one of the countries targeted by Trump's order, which has brought a sense of anxiety in her own family. The idea that her daughter's friends' grandparents would be barred from visiting the United States just because of who they are is unacceptable, and she wants her children to know that's not what America stands for, Moreno said. \"There are lots of Muslim students at her school. Hearing this stuff going on is really confusing\" to them, Moreno said. \"We like the idea of them having friends from everywhere.\" The leaders of Britain and Germany joined other American allies Sunday in criticizing President Donald Trump 's U.S. entry ban for people from some Muslim-majority countries, even as far-right politicians on the continent celebrated the move. A spokesman for Theresa May said the British Prime Minister... The leaders of Britain and Germany joined other American allies Sunday in criticizing President Donald Trump 's U.S. entry ban for people from some Muslim-majority countries, even as far-right politicians on the continent celebrated the move. A spokesman for Theresa May said the British Prime Minister... (Tribune news services) At the White House, the crowds were swelling through early Afternoon. Photos from social media showed packed Metro trains bound for the downtown core. The tone vacillated between forceful and unifying, as protesters alternately chanted \"SHAME\" and partook in renditions of \"America the Beautiful\" and \"This Land is Your Land.\" George Formukong, a police officer in the District, came to the rally with his family still wearing their dress clothes from church. They flew back from their native Cameroon on Saturday to learn that other travelers were being denied. \"Because our country was not on the list we were able to travel,\" Formukong said \"Everyone is an immigrant here. We should have equal treatment.\" For many, the demonstrations were personal. Amira Hassan, 26, remembered the excitement she felt when she flew into John F. Kennedy International Airport with her family as a refugee from Somalia in 2001. Hassan is graduate student in public administration at American University and a naturalized citizen. Following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, she said she has watched the rise of Islamophobia as her family built a life in the U.S. \"It's hard not to feel terrified and angry and sad and heartbroken,\" she said. Georgia Warner brought her nearly 3-month-old son to Dulles on Sunday, along with a sign that said \"Raising my son to tear down your wall #NoBanNoWall.\" He was born on Election Day. Warner is an 11th grade American history teacher in D.C., about to end her maternity leave. \"There might not be a better time in my lifetime to teach the U.S. Constitution and U.S. history,\" Warner said. Her message to visitors from around the world: \"There are still people who will stand by them and defend their rights.\"' Her husband, Chris Miller, said America's \"capacity for inclusiveness\" deserves to be protected. \"It's my job as a patriotic American to stand up for American values,\" Miller said, as he fed and burped his infant son. The family also was headed to protest at the White House. \"My oath didn't end when my enlistment did,\" said Lee Carter, another demonstrator who served in the Marines and is running for state office in Virginia. He carried an oversized florescent green declaration: \"I, Lee Carter, do solemnly affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign AND DOMESTIC #nevertrump #resist\".

    "text": "Email Last Updated Jan 28, 2017 11:02 AM EST At the Pentagon for a swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary Ret. Gen. James Mattis, Donald Trump signed two executive actions -- one on rebuilding the military and one making major changes to America\u2019s policies on refugees and immigration. \u201cI\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States,\u201d the president told an audience at the Pentagon Friday. Donald Trump calls for \u201cextreme\u201d ideological screening test for new immigrants Hours later the White House released details of the executive order titled \u201cProtecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States.\u201d It indefinitely suspends the United States\u2019 Syrian refugees program, which Trump had vowed to do on the campaign trail.\u00a0 U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order he said would impose tighter vetting to prevent foreign terrorists from entering the United States at the Pentagon in Washington, U.S., January 27, 2017. REUTERS It says \u201cthe entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d and suspends \u201cany such entry\u201d until the president has determined that \u201csufficient changes have been made to the USRAP [U.S. Refugee Admissions Program] to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\u201d Trump\u2019s order directs the State Department to stop issuing visas to Syrian nationals and halts the processing of Syrian refugees. That will remain in effect until Trump determines that enough security changes have been made to ensure that would-be terrorists can\u2019t exploit weaknesses in the current vetting system.\u00a0 The president, during his signing of the order at the Department of Homeland Security, also called on the Pentagon and the State Department to create a plan for safe zones in and around Syria to offer protection for Syrians fleeing the war there. But the signed order itself makes no mention of a plan for safe zones in Syria. A draft of the order had directed the Pentagon and the State Department to produce a plan for safe zones in the war-torn Mideast nation. Several other points included in the action: Trump ordered a 120-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which is America\u2019s broader refugee program. The suspension is intended to provide time to review how refugees are vetted before they are allowed to resettle in the United States. \u00a0 The executive action appears to be capping the number of refugees from other countries at 50,000 people in in fiscal year 2017, saying more than that \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\u00a0 The action says that when U.S. Refugee Admissions Program admissions resume, the Secretary of State in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, \u201cto prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s order did not spell out specifically what additional steps he wants to see the Homeland Security and State departments to add to the country\u2019s vetting system for refugees. Instead he directed officials to the review the refugee application and approval process to find any other security measures that can be added to prevent people who pose a threat from using the refugee program. Trump\u2019s executive order suspends all immigration from countries with terrorism concerns for 90 days. It was unclear from the law cited in the order which countries would be affected, though a draft of the order pointed to a legal provision that identified Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, all majority-Muslim countries, for at least 30 days. The order also calls for Homeland Security and State Department officials, along with the director of national intelligence, to review what information the government needs to fully vet would-be visitors and come up with a list of countries that don\u2019t provide it. The order says the government will give countries 60 days to start providing the information or citizens from those countries will be barred from traveling to the United States. In a portion of an interview released Friday, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that one group of refugees could look forward to some relief. He told the Christain Broadcasting Network that Christians in Syria find it \u201calmost impossible to get into the United States.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cThe reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody -- but more so the Christians,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d Christians comprise about 10 percent of the Syrian population, according to the CIA World Fact Book. Before the details of the action came to light, uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s plans to ban immigrants from certain countries from entering the U.S. caused stress among some already. Nuha Alsakkaff fled her war-torn country of Yemen six years ago. CBS Evening News Nuha Alsakkaff, 26, fled her war-torn country of Yemen more than six years ago. Alsakkaff is now a U.S citizen and is trying to get the rest of her family here, too. But if immigrants from Yemen are banned, she says she\u2019ll be devastated. \u201cI can\u2019t save my people. I can\u2019t save my family,\u201d she told CBS News . ",

U.S. Central Command announced Sunday that the casualties were sustained in an operation against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our elite servicemembers,\" Commander of U.S. Central Command Gen. Joseph Votel said in a statement. \"The sacrifices are very profound in our fight against terrorists who threaten innocent peoples across the globe.\" In a statement released Sunday, President Trump expressed his condolences: \"Americans are saddened this morning with news that a life of a heroic service member has been taken in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism. The sacrifices made by the men and women of our armed forces, and the families they leave behind, are the backbone of the liberty we hold so dear as Americans, united in our pursuit of a safer nation and a freer world.\" The Pentagon says the three service members were wounded in a raid, and another member of the military was injured when an aircraft had to make a \"hard landing at a nearby location.\" That aircraft was intentionally destroyed afterward. Article continues after sponsorship Officials from Central Command tell NPR's Alice Fordham that they are not aware of civilian casualties in the raid, but that they have not yet finished their debrief of the forces involved in the raid. But Nasser al-Awlaki \u2014 a former Yemeni minister of agriculture whose son was an al-Qaida proselytiser killed in a 2011 drone strike \u2014 tells Alice his 8-year-old granddaughter was killed in the raid, along with other children. \"The USA is committing crimes, you know, especially under this new administration. They attacked a village at midnight you know with women and children sleeping,\" Awlaki tells Alice. Alice reports that a local official, speaking on condition of anonymity, says he believes three children and six women were among 40 people killed in the raid, which took place in the central Yemeni province of Bayda. Fourteen members of AQAP were killed in the raid, according to Central Command, and U.S. military captured information \"that will likely provide insight into the planning of future terror plots.\" Of those AQAP members killed in the operation, Yemeni officials report that three were senior members of the local al-Qaida affiliate, according to The Associated Press.

(Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris, Getty Images for TNT) Amid protests nationwide over President Trump's immigration ban, stars reacted to the news Sunday at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles. When supporting actor nominee Dev Patel first learned of the temporary ban\u00a0\u2014 which prohibits citizens of seven countries from entering the USA\u00a0for at least the next 90 days\u00a0\u2014 \"I thought I had walked into a nightmare,\" he told USA TODAY. \"Of course,\u00a0the first thought in my head was women and children turning up to these shores with so much hope in their eyes being turned away. I can't imagine the pain they must be going through and for those families that are being separated, that voice of negativity and divisiveness at times like this. It's terrifying. SAG Awards 2017: Who is on the winners list? \"What gives me hope is all the people out there, those courageous human beings in the streets, in the airports, trying to spread positivity at least,\" \u00a0the\u00a0Lion\u00a0star added. James Marsden stayed focused on the awards as he talked\u00a0to USA TODAY. \"It's\u00a0on everybody's mind,\" said Marsden, who is nominated for\u00a0outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series for HBO's Westworld. \"There's unrest and it's all very new and happening very fast.\" The Big Bang Theory star Simon Helberg and his wife, Jocelyn Towne, made a political style statement with a sign reading, \"Refugees welcome\" and \"Let them in\" written on Towne's chest. Simon Helberg, left, and Jocelyn Towne at the Screen Actors Guild Awards Sunday. \u00a0(Photo: Christopher Polk, Getty Images for TNT) Soon after, Ashton Kutcher opened the telecast by welcoming his fellow actors, people watching at home and \"everyone in airports that belong\u00a0in my America. You are a part of the fabric of who we are, and we love you and we welcome you.\" After joking about Russian hacking and calling her win as best actress in a comedy series \"legitimate,\" Veep's Julia Louis-Dreyfus slammed Trump's ban. \"I want you all to know that I am the daughter of an immigrant,\" Louis-Dreyfus said. \"My father fled religious persecution in Nazi-occupied France. I am an American patriot and I love this country, and because I love this country, I am horrified by its blemishes. This immigrant ban is a blemish and it is un-American.\" Live from the 2017 Screen Actors Guild Awards Accepting the best comedy ensemble award for Netflix's Orange Is the New Black, actress Taylor Schilling called for unity amid the executive order. \"We stand here representing a diverse group of people,\" Schilling said. \"Representing generations of families who have sought a better life here from places like Nigeria, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia (and) Ireland. We know that it's going to be up to us and all of you to keep telling stories that show what unites us is stronger than the forces that seek to divide us.\" Contributing: Bryan Alexander and Andrea Mandell in Los Angeles A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

And, as Betty White has often showed, it's fun to watch a stuffy old authority figure act out in a silly modern way. Lauren Naturale, the dictionary's Content and Social Media Manager told NBC News that the \"response was overwhelmingly positive\" to the tweets, adding they are \"among the most viral tweets we've ever had.\" \"A number of people actually told us they were subscribing to our Unabridged dictionary, or getting our app, or running out to buy a physical book,\" Naturale said. Indeed, the public reaction has been \"big league,\" as the president might say. (Or is it \"bigly?\" Merriam-Webster found \"examples of big league as a figurative adjective from 1916. The adverbial use of big league favored by Trump is not often encountered, however.\") Related: In Trump's Twitter Presidency, Experts See Risks and Rewards The dictionary saw its Twitter followers surge to more than 260,000 during last year's election. And while it never engages directly with Trump or his aides, Merriam-Webster's cheeky subtweets regularly get tens of thousands of shares and attention from mainstream media outlets. ( Urban Dictionary \u2014 somewhat of an unruly cousin \u2014 defines \"subtweet\" as \"talking about someone behind their back but sort of in their face on Twitter.\" Merriam-Webster doesn't have a definition for the slang term, yet.) Dictionaries were early adopters of the Internet in the 1990s, recognizing its utility as a teaching tool. And Merriam-Webster, which traces its roots to Colonial-era American lexicographer Noah Webster, and has been reporting on trending words since 2010. \"Reporting on lookup trends completes the circle of telling the truth about words for us, because we have always used evidence of a word's use in order to write definitions,\" said Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large for Merriam-Webster. \"We don't comment on policy or politics, but when a public figure uses language in a remarkable way that makes the news, it's fair game for us.\" Related: Poll: Nearly 70 Percent of Americans Give a Thumbs Down to Trump's Twitter Habit Merriam-Webster's 2016 word of the year was \" surreal .\" Language has always been political, and it's possible the dictionary could join other elite institutions if Trump fans begin to see its definitions as compromised. George Orwell, another classroom favorite, whose \"1984\" has suddenly become a bestseller, described the \"special connection between politics and the debasement of language.\" Play ",

Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Rahnama said she waited for hours at the airport, with friends and family and a growing crowd of strangers who came to support them and other people whose loved ones were detained. They were finally released around midnight. \u201cHe was hungry and he was thirsty, and I could not see him,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can a five-year old be banned? Just because his parents are Iranian? We are American too,\u201d she said. \u201cI almost died in that airport. I can say it was the worst day of my life.\u201d Sunday morning, she brought her son and other family members to join the protest at Trump\u2019s door step. She wanted to send a message. \u201cI am here to say: You cannot do this. You are our servant. The people elected you,\u201d she said. \u201cOther countries are thirsty for the rights we have in America. We can\u2019t become a dictatorship.\u201d Protesters also gathered Sunday at the U.S. Capitol to protest Trump\u2019s education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos. At least one demonstrator was equipped for both, carrying a poster board that addressed one of the issues on each side. Meanwhile U.S. congressmen squared off with authorities at Dulles Airport, pressing airport police for information on the identities and status of detainees. The congressmen, Democratic Reps. Don Beyer and Gerald E. Connolly, all of Virginia, and Jamie B. Raskin of Maryland, were seeking access for attorneys to assist stranded travelers. In downtown Washington, protesters lined Pennsylvania Avenue and filled Lafayette Square. They cycled through a variety of chants, and wielded poster boards bearing messages such as \u201cIslamophobia is un-American\u201d and \u201cDissent is patriotic.\u201d \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here! \u2026 No hate! No fear! Refugees are welcome here!\u201d they chanted. \u201cNo justice! No peace! No justice! No peace!\u201d The travel ban bars entry into the United States from seven predominately Muslim countries. Despite a federal judge\u2019s ruling late Saturday night, and similar court decisions with varying degrees of power, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement Sunday that said the agency would continue to implement the travel rule. At Dulles, hundreds of peaceful demonstrators sang the \u201cNational Anthem\u201d and created a cheering gauntlet for travelers emerging from Customs. The crowd yelled \u201cLet them in!\u201d and \u201cWelcome!\u201d as passengers, including some from majority-Muslim countries, rolled their suitcases through gray doors and into a section of the airport that had become a makeshift law office and civics classroom in response to Trump\u2019s executive order. [ Trump official appears to walk back inclusion of green-card holders in travel ban even as others defend it ] \u201cMy kids go to school with people from everywhere,\u201d said Sasha Moreno, of Reston, Va., whose six-year-old daughter drew a little red statue of liberty on poster board along with the message: \u201cWelcome to America.\u201d Her daughter\u2019s kindergarten class includes many students from Sudan, one of the countries targeted by Trump\u2019s order, which has brought a sense of anxiety in her own family. The idea that her daughter\u2019s friends\u2019 grandparents would be barred from visiting the United States just because of who they are is unacceptable, and she wants her children to know that\u2019s not what America stands for, Moreno said. \u201cThere are lots of Muslim students at her school. Hearing this stuff going on is really confusing\u201d to them, Moreno said. \u201cWe like the idea of them having friends from everywhere.\u201d At the White House, the crowds swelled through early afternoon. Photos from social media showed packed Metro trains bound for the downtown core. The tone vacillated between forceful and unifying, as protesters alternately chanted \u201cSHAME\u201d and partook in renditions of \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d and \u201cThis Land is Your Land.\u201d [ Uber triggers protest for not supporting taxi strike against refugee ban ] George Formukong, a police officer in the District, came to the rally with his family still wearing their dress clothes from church. They flew back from their native Cameroon on Saturday to learn that other travelers were being denied entry. \u201cBecause our country was not on the list we were able to travel,\u201d Formukong said \u201cEveryone is an immigrant here. We should have equal treatment.\u201d For many, the demonstrations were personal. Amira Hassan, 26, remembered the excitement she felt when she flew into John F. Kennedy International Airport with her family as a refu\u00adgee from Somalia in 2001. Hassan is graduate student in public administration at American University and a naturalized citizen. Since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, she said she has watched the rise of Islamophobia as her family built a life in the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to feel terrified and angry and sad and heartbroken,\u201d she said. Georgia Warner brought her nearly 3-month-old son to Dulles on Sunday, along with a sign that said \u201cRaising my son to tear down your wall #NoBanNoWall.\u201d He was born on Election Day. Warner is an 11th grade American history teacher in the District, about to end her maternity leave. \u201cThere might not be a better time in my lifetime to teach the U.S. Constitution and U.S. history,\u201d Warner said. Her message to visitors from around the world: \u201cThere are still people who will stand by them and defend their rights.\u201d\u2019 Her husband, Chris Miller, said America\u2019s \u201ccapacity for inclusiveness\u201d deserves to be protected. \u201cIt\u2019s my job as a patriotic American to stand up for American values,\u201d Miller said, as he fed and burped his infant son. The family also was headed to protest at the White House. \u201cMy oath didn\u2019t end when my enlistment did,\u201d said Lee Carter, another demonstrator who served in the Marines and is running for state office in Virginia. He carried an oversized florescent green declaration: \u201cI, Lee Carter, do solemnly affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign AND DOMESTIC #nevertrump #resist\u201d.

    "text": "Koch Brothers' Network Says Trump Immigration Ban Likely \u2018Counterproductive\u2019 By Liz Kreutz INDIAN WELLS, California \u0097 Jan 29, 2017, 4:35 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump's Frenzied First Week in Office 0 Shares Email Add the Koch brothers \u2019 network to the list of those questioning President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order on immigration. In a statement released Sunday, an official for the political network led by the Republican billionaires, said the organization believes Trump\u2019s ban on immigration from seven predominately Muslim countries will likely be \u201ccounterproductive.\ufffd? \"We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\ufffd? Brian Hooks, who oversees the Koch network\u2019s bi-annual seminars, said. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. \"Our country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies,\ufffd? he added. On Saturday, as demonstrations broke out at airports across the country in response to Trump\u2019s immigration executive order, roughly 550 of the Koch brothers\u2019 top donors gathered near Palm Springs, California, for their network\u2019s winter seminar. Officials for the network told reporters they were encouraged by some of what they've seen so far from the new administration, but that it's too soon to say for certain. They pointed to Trump's regulatory reforms, his executive order on the Keystone pipeline, and some of his Cabinet appointments as areas where the Koch network is hopeful. \u201cThere\u2019s been some good things, for sure,\ufffd? Mark Holden, a top official for the network, told reporters of Trump\u2019s first full week in office. Such optimism is a shift from the Koch brothers\u2019 critical view of Trump during the campaign. The controversial political donors did not spend any money on the then-Republican nominee, focusing instead on supporting down-ballot races. The immigration ban was not a major topic of conversation here at the palm tree-filled oasis, however. Charles Koch didn't mention it during remarks at the opening reception, nor was it a topic of discussion during the post-dinner panel with Republican Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, and Mike Lee, R-Utah. Instead, the focus was on issues like health care and tax reform. Proud of how they did in races this past November, the network announced plans to be even more aggressive in their spending next cycle, as they hope to maintain control of the House and Senate. According to a spokesperson, the Koch network will spend between $300 and 400 million dollars on politics and policy during the 2018 races, up from $250 million in 2016. \"We had by far the most productive year in the history of this network,\" Charles Koch told donors about this past cycle. \"We're just getting started.\" 0 Shares ",

The American Civil Liberties Union, assisted by immigration and refugee groups, have successfully brought multiple suits forward to curb Trump's executive order that restricts the access of travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations \u2014 Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \"We have been able to curb the immediate and disturbing consequences of an unconstitutional and unconscionable executive order,\" said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. The original ruling against the executive order came from a federal judge in New York who said that those who arrived in the United States legally from the seven nations could not be deported. This applied to visa and green card holders alike and is a nationwide injunction. Related: Merkel: Terror Fight Does Not Justify Trump Immigration Ban The ACLU with the help of refugee and immigrant rights groups in Massachusetts and Virginia were able to gain additional footholds beyond the baseline order made in New York. In Boston, two federal judges placed a restraining order on Trump's travel ban that will last for at least seven days. In Virginia, lawyers earned the right to meet with detainees and the DHS and Customs and Border Protection were forbidden from deporting legal immigrants for a week. The Trump administration and the Department of Homeland Security pushed back on the rulings. A senior White House official said Sunday that the president had the right and Constitutional power to enact the order. According to the official, the judge's decision changed nothing. \"All stopped visas will remain stopped. All halted admissions will remain halted. All restricted travel will remain prohibited,\" the official said. \"The executive order is a vital action toward strengthening America's borders, and therefore sovereignty. The order remains in place.\" With the federal judges' ruling appearing to conflict with the executive order, uncertainty and chaos continued across the nation as lawyers sought access to those detained at airports and reports rolled in that Customs and Border Patrol agents were not abiding by the federal ruling.

    "text": "A Navy Seal with a helicopter behind him in an undated photo. 0 Shares Email One U.S. service member was killed and three others were injured in Yemen during a raid Saturday by Navy SEALs targeting al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's senior leadership, officials said today. The operation, which officials said was launched by the elite counterterrorism unit SEAL Team Six, was the first carried out with the direct approval of President Donald Trump and resulted in 14 al-Qaeda operatives killed, officials said. Trump in a statement Sunday afternoon only referred to American \"service members\" in hailing the operation against \"radical Islamic\" terrorists, which he said was vital to preventing future attacks. \"Americans are saddened this morning with news that a life of a heroic service member has been taken in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism. The sacrifices made by the men and women of our armed forces, and the families they leave behind, are the backbone of the liberty we hold so dear as Americans, united in our pursuit of a safer nation and a freer world. My deepest thoughts and humblest prayers are with the family of this fallen service member. I also pray for a quick and complete recovery for the brave service members who sustained injuries,\" Trump said. AQAP in a statement claimed 30 civilians were killed in the American raid and showed photos of purported victims -- including the bloodied remains of a girl the terrorist group said was the 8-year-old daughter of firebrand imam Anwar al-Awlaki, AQAP's American former leader in charge of plots against the country of his birth. It was unclear whether Awlaki's daughter was killed in the SEAL raid overseen by Joint Special Operations Command, died elsewhere or not at all. But she likely is a \"U.S. person\" under U.S. law by virtue of her birth to a father who was an American, since the Las Cruces, N.M.-born elder Awlaki's citizenship was never revoked. U.S. officials said there are no internal reports of civilian casualties, but one official noted they will keep taking seriously the claims of civilian casualties. Awlaki was killed by CIA drone-fired missiles in 2011. His U.S.-born and raised son Abdulrahman, 16, was killed two weeks later in a controversial U.S. drone strike. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, appearing on ABC's \"This Week,\" without commenting on the claim of killing civilians or Awlaki's daughter, said the operation was a blow to AQAP's efforts to attack the United States. \"They got 14 individuals. They killed 14 individuals and captured a whole host of information about future plots that's going to benefit this country and keep us safe,\" he said. \"We mourn for the loss of life of the service member who so bravely fought for this country and was killed,\" Spicer said, adding that, \"the President was informed throughout the evening of the situation. He extends his condolences. But more importantly, he understands the fight that our servicemen and women conduct on a daily basis to keep this country safe.\" \"This is one in a series of aggressive moves against terrorist planners in Yemen and worldwide,\" the U.S. military's Central Command said in a statement. A counterterrorism official told ABC News that the Navy's SEAL Team Six, formally known as Naval Special Warfare Development Group, engaged in afirefight at the site of the rare ground force raid in the al-Bayda region of Yemen, and that special operations targeting top AQAP leaders including top \"emir\" Qassim al-Raymi are continuing. The primary mission of the raid was \u201csite exploitation\u201d said a U.S. official who explained that ground forces were used to preserve exploitable information that could be used for intelligence purposes. One operator was killed in action and three others were injured critically, officials said. The name of the service member killed in action is being withheld pending notification of next of kin, CENTCOM said. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our elite service members,\u201d Commander of U.S. Central Command Gen. Joseph Votel said in a statement. \u201cThe sacrifices are very profound in our fight against terrorists who threaten innocent peoples across the globe.\u201d In addition, the U.S. lost a Marine MV-22 Osprey aircraft after it suffered a hard landing that rendered it incapable of taking off again. The aircraft was destroyed by U.S. forces on the spot. AQAP posted a photo of a young girl on blankets prepared for burial, with a clenched bloody hand, who they claimed was Awlaki's 8-year-old daughter killed in the American raid Saturday. They also denied losing any armed operatives. \"No Al-Qaedah members were killed in the US raid in Yakla\u2019. Only women and children were killed in the raid together with some tribal leaders who have no connections to Al-Qaedah,\" the group said in a message distributed through the encrypted phone app Telegram, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. \"Only civilians were killed, mainly children, including the daughter of Shaykh Anwar Al-Awlaki. May Allah accept them, and may Allah hasten his revenge.\" ABC News' Paul Blake contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS/AP January 29, 2017, 1:35 PM Across globe, Trump travel ban inspires fear, petitions and some applause Email LONDON -- Anger and dismay, along with congratulations from Europe\u2019s far-right, rippled across the world Sunday as politicians, community leaders and even a sports star reacted to the entry ban President Donald Trump imposed on refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations. As the realization sank in that people with dual-citizenship who live outside the targeted Mideast and African countries would be affected, condemnation mixed with concern about families with traveling members who could be prevented from returning to the United States they call home. Olympic long-distance running champion Mo Farah - born in Somalia, citizen and knight of Britain, U.S. resident and currently training in Ethiopia - wondered how he would tell his children that \u201cdaddy might not be able to come home.\u201d The ban, Farah said in a statement on his Facebook page, \u201ccomes from a place of ignorance and prejudice\u201d and \u201cseems to have made me an alien.\u201d On 1st January this year, Her Majesty The Queen made me a Knight of the Realm. On 27th January, President Donald Trump... Posted by Mo Farah on\u00a0 Sunday, January 29, 2017 Etihad Airways, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 national airline, said some of its passengers were affected by the new policies and like other major airlines, was working closely with American officials on the matter. Leaders of Britain and Germany joined other American allies in criticizing Trump\u2019s entry ban, even as some far-right politicians expressed hope the move would inspire similar measures in Europe. British Prime Minister Theresa May does \u201cnot agree\u201d with Trump\u2019s order and will challenge the U.S. government if it has an adverse effect on British nationals, a spokesman said. The official comment came after May said during a meeting Saturday with Turkish leaders the decision was a matter solely for the U.S. Her main political rival, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, called for Trump to be banned from visiting Britain until the temporary travel restrictions are rescinded. A petition on the British Parliament\u2019s website attracted hundreds of thousands of signatures backing its call for Trump, who has been invited to meet Queen Elizabeth II, to be barred on the basis of misogyny and vulgarity. Demonstrators denounce president's order which blocks refugees from entering the country and imposes ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority nat... The petition had more than half a million signatures by Sunday afternoon. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has drawn fire for her government\u2019s welcoming refugee policies, also regretted the ban. Merkel raised the issue during a phone call with Trump Saturday, citing the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention that calls on signatories to take in people fleeing war, spokesman Steffen Seibert said. While more protests have been planned across the nation against President Trump's temporary ban on some immigrants from entering the United State... \u201cShe is convinced that even the necessary, resolute fight against terrorism doesn\u2019t justify putting people of a particular origin or particular faith under general suspicion,\u201d Seibert said. He said Germany\u2019s government \u201cwill now examine what consequences the U.S. government\u2019s measures have for German citizens with dual citizenship and, if necessary, represent their interests toward our American partners.\u201d The order Trump issued Friday includes a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. Influential Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr reacted by suggesting all Americans should be forced out of Iraq in retaliation, according to a statement from his office. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, also was sharp in her criticism of Trump\u2019s move. \u201cAll men are first and foremost human beings, with their inalienable rights,\u201d Mogherini wrote in a blog post. She added: \u201cIt feels so strange that we need to restate this, just days after Holocaust Remembrance Day.\u201d In contrast, nationalist and far-right groups in Europe applauded the restrictions and said they should be used a model for the continent. The Dutch anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders said in a tweet: \u201cWell done POTUS it\u2019s the only way to stay safe + free. I would do the same. Hope you\u2019ll add more Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia soon.\u201d The far-right National Democratic Party in Germany celebrated \u201cthe massive restriction on the entry of pseudo-refugees and Muslims to the USA.\u201d In Italy, the leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League party also expressed admiration. \u201cWhat Trump\u2019s doing on the other side of the ocean, I\u2019d like it done also here,\u201d Matteo Salvini told reporters. Referring to the hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers and economic migrants rescued while crossing the Mediterranean and brought to Italy in recent years, Salvini said there is \u201can invasion underway which needs to be blocked.\u201d He is pressing for early elections and courting other far-right leaders for a possible campaign coalition. Italy\u2019s Interior Minister Marco Minniti, who had held top security roles in recent governments, warned against \u201cequating immigration and terrorism.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be careful,\u201d he said in a speech Sunday to officials from the main government coalition party, the Democrats. \u201cDissatisfaction and marginalization becomes the culture terrain of terrorism.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Starbucks to Hire 10,000 Refugees Over Next 5 Years By josh boak, ap economics writer WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 29, 2017, 7:42 PM ET 0 Shares Email Starbucks says it will hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years, a response to President Donald Trump's indefinite suspension of Syrian refugees and temporary travel bans that apply to six other Muslim-majority nations. Howard Schultz, the coffee retailer's chairman and CEO, said in a letter to employees Sunday that the hiring would apply to stores worldwide and the effort would start in the United States where the focus would be on hiring immigrants \"who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel.\" Schultz, a supporter of Hillary Clinton during the presidential run, took aim at other parts of a Trump agenda focused on immigration, repealing former President Barack Obama's health care law and restructuring trade with Mexico. The letter said that Starbucks would help support coffee growers in Mexico, provide health insurance to eligible workers if the health care law is repealed and back an Obama-era immigration program that allows young immigrants who were brought to the country as children to apply for a two-year reprieve from deportation and a work permit. The move reflects the increasing complexity that businesses face when dealing with the Trump administration. Trump has met with CEOs at Ford, General Motors and Boeing and asked them to create jobs in the United States, while touting each announcement about new factory jobs as a success even if those additions had been planned before his presidential victory. But not all corporate leaders have embraced Trump. Schultz added that Starbucks would aim to communicate with workers more frequently, saying Sunday, \"I am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "advertisement Oscar-nominated Iranian director Asghar Farhadi will skip next month's Academy Awards following President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration, saying he would not attend even if granted an exception to the travel ban. In a statement to the New York Times, Farhadi said he previously planned on attending the event with his cinematographer but would not now in light of the executive order Trump signed Friday that banned refugees from entering the U.S. for at least 120 days. The order also prohibited citizens from six other Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., including those from Syria, Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Farhadi's native Iran. Director Asghar Farhadi attends the closing ceremony of the 69th annual Cannes Film Festival at the Palais des Festivals on May 22, 2016 in Cannes, France. Tristan Fewings / Getty Images \"I have decided to not attend the Academy Awards Ceremony alongside my fellow members of the cinematic community,\" Farhadi, whose movie \"The Salesman\" is up for Best Foreign Language Film, told the Times. \"I hereby express my condemnation of the unjust conditions forced upon some of my compatriots and the citizens of the other six countries trying to legally enter the United States of America and hope that the current situation will not give rise to further divide between nations.\" Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, broadcast Farhadi's situation in a tweet, saying: \"Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's. He's nominated for best foreign language film... #MuslimBan .\" Confirmed: Iran's Asghar Farhadi won't be let into the US to attend Oscar's. He's nominated for best foreign language film... #MuslimBan \u2014 Trita Parsi (@tparsi) January 28, 2017 A day before Trump signed the executive order, \"The Salesman\" actress Taraneh Alidoosti announced that she would be boycotting the awards ceremony to show her objection to talks of a ban. On Twitter, the 33-year-old actress said: \"Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest.\" Thousands of protesters gathered for a second day Sunday in cities and airports across the country as immigration and civil rights groups continued to file actions to help legal immigrants enter the country after Trump signed the controversial travel ban on Friday. About 200 people will be affected by the ruling, the ACLU estimates. Farhadi's 2012 film \"The Separation\" won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film five years ago and his most recent nomination marks the third time in history an Iranian film has been recognized by the Academy.

    "text": "Jan 29 2017, 4:07 pm ET Still Vacant Appointments Threaten Implementation of Trump Agenda by Alexandra Jaffe advertisement During his first week in office, President Donald Trump upended U.S. trade policy, directed officials to begin making plans to build a wall on the southern border and ordered an investigation into vote fraud, all with the stroke of a pen. But experts warn the flurry of activity from the Oval Office could slow to a grind when it comes to the implementation of many of those plans if Trump doesn't pick up the pace in selecting nominees for hundreds of appointed posts that fill out the executive branch. \"We're not talking about a small operation here \u2014 it's one of the biggest on the planet,\" said Terry Sullivan, the associate director of the White House Transition Project, of the size of the U.S. federal government. \"When you don't have people at the helm that means things could run aground.\" Play Trump's first week: 'Chaos rules at this White House,' analyst says 4:05 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170129220453if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/864036931643\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> More than 1,100 executive branch positions are subject to Senate approval; about 700 of those were deemed crucial by the Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service. Those include cabinet secretaries, deputy and assistant secretaries, heads of agencies and other management and leadership positions. Trump has so far announced nominees for 33 of the 700 positions; four of those nominees have been confirmed, according to a Washington Post tracker . It's a pace that's only slightly slower than his predecessors, Sullivan said, but \"that gap is probably going to continue to widen \u2014 and as it widens, that means the government is probably not standing up.\" That's because as long as it's taking to confirm Trump's cabinet secretaries \u2014 at least one, Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, has had his hearing delayed three times \u2014 it's an even longer road to filling out the rest of the government. That, experts say, typically takes over a year. Lower appointees are subject to the same background check and Office of Government Ethics review as cabinet secretaries, and though their appointments typically win easy confirmation the whole process takes time. And that clock hasn't yet started ticking, because the Trump administration hasn't announced nominees for most of these major appointments. But Sullivan indicated that as long as those key positions remain vacant or filled in the interim by Obama appointees, it will be tough for Trump's policy shifts to take full effect. \"When you don't have anybody identified or in place to carry out the administration's policy, the government continues to do what it was doing,\" he said.

Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said business experience doesn't always translate to government, and cabinet secretaries have to be ready to navigate the huge, winding bureaucracy on Day One. \"Large organizations are different in the private sector than they are in the government,\" he said. \"You don't have a lot of time for on-the-job learning.\" That's exacerbated by the loss of institutional knowledge that comes with the exodus of staff from the former administration \u2014 a process that's expected when the White House shifts parties, but one that the Trump Administration has seemed eager to expedite. On Thursday, the Trump administration ousted four top State Department officials, and news broke that the head of the Border Patrol left a post he had only held since October. That comes the day after Trump announced a raft of new immigration moves, including plans to build a wall on the southern border, that will require full cooperation of the Border Patrol for implementation. The State Department exodus included the department's Undersecretary for Management, who had been in the post since 2007, and comes on the heels of the departures of other long-serving diplomats who quit when Trump took over. State and other federal agencies won't grind to a halt without key staff; others will take over their positions in the interim. But Stier warned that scenario wasn't sustainable \u2014 and that the consequences could be bigger than Trump's agenda. \"He's not going to be able to deal with the crises that will come up as effectively as possible,\" he said. \"As much as he may have his own agenda, the world will throw curveballs. It's hard to do if you don't have your team in place.\" Alexandra Jaffe ",

The British actor's death was confirmed Friday by his publicist. Ian Gavan/Getty Images John Hurt, a British actor best known for lead roles in The Elephant Man and Nineteen Eighty-Four and a shockingly gory death in Alien, has died at 77, his publicist confirmed to NPR late Friday. No details of his death were immediately available. He had announced in 2015 that he'd been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer , Variety reports. In more recent years Hurt used his weathered looks and voice in a variety of supporting roles in movies such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, V For Vendetta, Snowpiercer and last year's Jackie. He also portrayed a recent incarnation of the titular character in the beloved British TV show Doctor Who. Hurt received Academy Award nominations for his work in Midnight Express in 1978 and David Lynch's The Elephant Man in 1980, but may be best remembered for his death-by-parasite-birth in Ridley Scott's Alien, a scene he comedically reprised several years later in Mel Brooks' Spaceballs.

Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press hide caption toggle caption Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press Russ Girling, president and CEO of TransCanada Corporation, addresses the company's annual meeting in 2015 in Calgary, Alberta. Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press Just as President Trump takes power promising to ramp up oil and gas production, a sudden resignation in a key agency threatens to put such projects on hold across the United States. On Thursday, Norman Bay, one of just three current members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), said he would resign effective Feb. 3, even though his term isn't up until next year. His announcement came shortly after Trump decided Bay's fellow commissioner, Cheryl LaFleur, would serve as the Commission's new chair. \"I think [Bay] was perhaps disappointed that Commissioner LaFleur was elevated above him,\" says Carolyn Elefant, an energy lawyer who represents landowners negotiating with pipeline companies. After Bay's abrupt decision, Elefant says she's \"heard in some FERC circles he's being criticized for that.\" The resignation could mean costly delays for some major pipeline projects. The independent agency oversees the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas and oil. It's supposed to have five commissioners, but Bay's departure leaves FERC with just two \u2014 not enough for the required quorum to make decisions. Some projects that have been through years of regulatory review and were nearing the finish line could now be in limbo for months. Article continues after sponsorship That includes new multibillion dollar transmission pipelines intended to alleviate a glut of natural gas in the Appalachian basin. If approved, they will supply markets including the East Coast, Midwest, Gulf Coast and Canada. TransCanada Submits New Application To Build Keystone XL Pipeline It's unclear what impact the FERC delay might have on the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, which Mr. Trump aimed to green light through executive actions this past week. Williams Partners' Atlantic Sunrise pipeline is among those awaiting final word from FERC. The pipeline would ship gas from northeastern Pennsylvania southward and connect into a larger network of existing lines. \"The president clearly recognizes that natural gas infrastructure is critical to U.S. economic growth, job creation and expanding the American manufacturing base,\" says Williams spokesman Chris Stockton in an email. \"We believe this administration will prioritize filling the commission's vacancies so that critical natural gas infrastructure projects like Atlantic Sunrise can be approved.\" The project has faced intense criticism from local opponents, who recently built encampments and are working with activists who participated in the protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. On Friday the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, a trade group representing pipeline operators, sent Trump a letter urging him to act quickly to fill the vacancy. Dakota Access Pipeline Foes: We Aren't Done Fighting Yet \"The most significant barrier to building this infrastructure is often the permitting and approval process,\" wrote INGAA president Donald Santa. \"We must have a functioning FERC to move forward with building this critical energy infrastructure.\" Even if the president chooses someone quickly, the process will likely take several months \u2014 the appointment requires Senate confirmation. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, says she will make it a top priority. \"After next week, FERC will need a full complement of commissioners as soon as possible so that it can tackle the important work on its busy docket,\" Murkowski said in a statement. \"The senate's challenge will be to promptly consider, without undue delay, FERC nominations once they are received.\" In the meantime the agency's Acting Chairman Cheryl LaFleur says the next few days before Bay leaves will be busy ones. \"The commission is working to get as many orders out as we can in the time we have left with a quorum,\" she says. \"I am confident that, with the strong team we have here at the commission, we can continue to do our important work.\" This story is from StateImpact Pennsylvania , a collaboration between WITF and WHYY covering the fiscal and environmental impact of Pennsylvania's energy economy ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Nor did the list include the European countries where disenfranchised Muslim communities have become hotbeds of militancy, leading to major attacks in Paris and Brussels in the name of the Islamic State. Because no visas are required for travel by most European citizens to the United States, and because of the volume of tourism and business, restricting travel from Europe would have been far more difficult and consequential than banning it from only the seven countries named. Video Trump Applauds Situation at Airports After signing three more executive orders on Saturday, President Trump told reporters that Friday's order on immigration was \"not a Muslim ban\" and was \"working out very nicely,\" pointing to airports where travelers and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries had been detained. embed By Mr. Kurzman\u2019s count, 123 people have been killed in the United States by Muslim terrorists since the 2001 attacks \u2014 out of a total of more than 230,000 killings, by gang members, drug dealers, angry spouses, white supremacists, psychopaths, drunks and people of every description. So the order addresses, at most, one-1,870th of the problem of lethal violence in America. If the toll of Sept. 11 is included, jihadists still account for just over 1 percent of killings. \u201cMy advice to the new administration would be to declare victory,\u201d Mr. Kurzman said. For the average American, he added, \u201cyour odds of being victimized by a terrorist attack are infinitesimal.\u201d But terrorists \u2014 the root of the word means \u201cto cause to tremble\u201d \u2014 do not operate in the realm of dry facts and statistics. Their purpose is to terrify, and they use random and spectacular violence to do it, with an invaluable assist from the saturation coverage on cable television and news websites that such outrages inevitably draw. To the rational calculations of Mr. Kurzman, one might simply reply with the list of American cities where horrific jihadist attacks have occurred in recent years: Boston; San Bernardino, Calif.; and Orlando, Fla. \u2014 place names that conjure up images of ghastly wounds, bullet-ridden bodies and frightened people running for cover. In Gallup polls , the number of Americans \u201cvery worried\u201d or \u201csomewhat worried\u201d about such attacks generally hovers between 30 and 50 percent, with understandable spikes after new attacks. In the political realm, where emotions and symbols hold sway, Mr. Trump\u2019s order may reassure some Americans that they are safer from terrorism, and more generally, from concerns that Muslim immigrants may bring an alien culture. (While ostensibly addressing terrorism, it also says that the United States should be protected against those with \u201chostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles\u201d or those \u201cwho do not support the Constitution.\u201d ) The trouble with such reassurance, even if it is effective, is that it comes at a high cost, in the view of many experts on terrorism. That cost will be counted not just domestically but also abroad, where the United States relies on allies, including Muslim countries, for intelligence and other help against terrorism. Impacted by Trump\u2019s order? Are you affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration \u2014 or know someone who is? If you have information, please contact us at immigration@nytimes.com . Email Us \u201cIn my opinion, this is just a huge mistake in terms of counterterrorism cooperation,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, formerly the State Department\u2019s top counterterrorism official and now a scholar at Dartmouth. \u201cFor the life of me, I don\u2019t see why we would want to alienate the Iraqis when they are the ground force against ISIS.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story At home as well, Mr. Benjamin said, the president\u2019s order is likely to prove counterproductive. The jihadist threat in the United States has turned out to be largely homegrown, he said, and the order will encourage precisely the resentments and anxieties on the part of Muslims that fuel, in rare cases, support for the ideology of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda. \u201cIt sends an unmistakable message to the American Muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. That, he said, will \u201cfeed the jihadist narrative\u201d that the United States is at war with Islam, potentially encouraging a few more Muslims to plot violence.

USA TODAY NETWORK Thousands of people protest President Trump's immigration ban on citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries outside the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29, 2017. (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, EPA) Forty-eight hours after President Trump signed\u00a0an executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, chaos reigned at U.S. airports, as authorities, travelers and lawyers struggled Sunday to understand how the ban\u00a0is being implemented. Attorneys for civil rights and immigration advocacy groups said\u00a0Customs and Border Protection agents are interpreting Trump's orders\u00a0differently. At some international airports,\u00a0including Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas, all people who were detained have been allowed to enter the United States. At others, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York's JFK International Airport, lawyers said an undetermined number of travelers remained in custody. Three federal courts \u2014 in New York, Virginia and Boston \u2014\u00a0have issued rulings since Saturday night to protect people who were in transit to the U.S. when the order went into effect Friday and got caught in\u00a0legal limbo. The \u00a0ban affects people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The\u00a0Department of Homeland Security said that as of Saturday night, 109 people had been detained, but it has yet to follow through on a New York judge's order to release a list of all people still being detained, including travelers who may have arrived on U.S. soil Sunday. The result?\u00a0\"Mass confusion,\" said\u00a0\u00a0Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project who argued the case in New York. \"The government took no steps to make sure that people understood what the order means and how it should be implemented. (Trump) just threw it out there without ensuring that it would be implemented fairly and even-handed and properly.\" Protests against Trump's immigration plan rolling in more than 30 cities The White House and Homeland Security countered that they provided new guidelines to agents working at airports and that only a small fraction of travelers were affected by the order. On Saturday, when asked about the roll-out of his executive order, Trump said \"it's working out very nicely.\" And several White House officials appeared on Sunday talk shows to say that civil rights groups were blowing the confusion out of proportion. So where do things really stand? A ruling issued late Saturday by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York barred Customs and Border Protection officials across the country from deporting any immigrants, including refugees and legal immigrants from the seven predominantly Muslim countries targeted in Trump's order, so long as they hold a valid visa. That order dealt only with immigrants who had already arrived in the U.S. or were already in transit. Homeland Security said it would comply with that order, but made clear it would continue carrying out Trump's executive order, meaning they will try and stop any other refugees or legal immigrants from the seven countries listed in the president's order from heading to the U.S. Lawyers will soon begin arguing the overall legality of Trump's executive order, a possibly weeks-long process that will ultimately determine whether the order is allowed to stand. Experts question legality of Trump's immigration ban on Muslim countries But much remains unclear. Part of the problem has been the lack of information coming from the departments of Homeland Security and State. The first official mention of the new guidelines to appear online came from an Arabic-language Twitter account run by the State Department. It sent out three tweets on Saturday instructing citizens from the seven countries listed in Trump's order not to travel to the U.S., pay any visa fees\u00a0or show up for visa\u00a0interviews. The tweets did not mention, however, that those with permanent resident status \u2014 or green-card holders \u00a0\u2014 from those countries are still allowed to enter the U.S. Homeland Security said\u00a0it provided new guidance to all of its port officials immediately after Trump signed the\u00a0order,\u00a0and updated its computerized targeting system to identify those people.\u00a0But the department did not start providing guidance to travelers until Sunday. Homeland Security's first tweet came early Sunday, which linked to the department's statement declaring that it would carry out Trump's order and that\u00a0\"prohibited travel will remain prohibited.\" There was no guidance on which travelers should stay home and no clarification of how the order affected green-card holders. It wasn't until Sunday night that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly declared\u00a0that he had deemed \"the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.\" That leaves refugees and people entering the country on temporary visas, such as for business and tourism, barred from entering the country. The web sites of both agencies made no mention of the new order as of Sunday evening. Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, echoed the sentiments of many Republicans when he praised Trump for his executive order, arguing that the U.S. vetting system was overdue for an overhaul. But he criticized the way it\u2019s been carried out. \"(The administration) failed to provide clear guidance on the policy which caused substantial confusion at the ports of entry,\"\u00a0Labrador said. \"Inadequate review and poor implementation of this executive action threatens to undermine otherwise sound policy.\" 3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jH83mv NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

But we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border,\u201d Trump said Sunday afternoon. \u201cThis is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. \u2026 My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.\u201d Trump issued the statement as hundreds of protesters marched in Washington and in other cities across the country to protest the president's self-described \u201cextreme vetting\u201d -- which resulted this weekend in dozens of foreign visitors and some legal permanent U.S. residents being detained at domestic airports. Earlier in the day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., staged a press conference with some immigrant children and adults impacted by the bans and vowed to fight them on Capitol Hill \u201cwith every fiber of my being.\u201d Sen.\u00a0Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., said that she would introduce two bills Monday. One of the bills would rescind Trump's order, while the other would give Congress greater oversight of the president's immigration authority. \u00a0 And California Democratic Rep. Lou Correa said the executive orders on illegal immigration \u201cdirectly challenge the right to due process under the Constitution\u201d and that he\u2019ll introduce legislation to fund legal aid to those who are \u201ctargeted.\u201d Congressional Democrats led by Schumer, who said he\u2019s already appealed to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, will have a difficult task getting any kind of measure through the Republican-control Congress that would reverse the executive order. \u201cI doubt many Arkansans or Americans more broadly object to taking a harder look at foreigners coming into our country from war-torn nations with known terror networks. I think they\u2019re wondering why we don\u2019t do that already,\u201d said Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, who as an Army officer served combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. However, Trump is facing opposition for some congressional Republicans, including Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, and Barbara Comstock, of Virginia, along with Sens. Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and John McCain, of Arizona. \"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly vetted,\u201d Graham and McCain said in a joint statement. \"Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d Trump, a Republican, tweeted in response that the statement was \u201cwrong\u201d and that the senators were \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d The executive order Trump issued Friday imposes a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program and a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. On Saturday afternoon -- as reports surfaced about foreign visitors being detained at New York\u2019s Kennedy airport and elsewhere -- Trump said his plan to prevent Islamic terrorists and others for attacking the United States was \u201cworking out very nicely.\u201d But by Saturday evening, a federal judge in Brooklyn issued a temporary halt on the part of the executive order that allows the Trump administration to deport people from the largely-Muslim countries. \u201cOur country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday morning. Meanwhile, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cThese are countries that have a history of training, harboring, exporting terrorists.\u201d And White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus argued that as many as 80 percent of Americans agree with the policy change, while dismissing media reports about chaotic scenes Saturday at U.S. airports. \u201cI do not think there was any chaos,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d while predicting more people will be detained and offering \u201cno apologies.\u201d Priebus also seemed to suggest that foreign arrivals who have so-called \u201cgreen cards\u201d that allows them to permanently live and work in the United States will not be subject to the additional screenings. \u201cAs far as green-card holders going forward, it doesn\u2019t affect them,\u201d he told NBC. Kelly said later that allowed green card holders into the country \u00a0was \"in the national interest\u201d of the country. And Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman \u00a0of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said Trump's order had been \"poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders.\" Trump, Conway and Priebus argued Sunday that the seven countries were in fact identified by President Obama in 2015 and pointed out that roughly 40 other such nations included Afghanistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia were not part of the travel ban. Trump is also facing opposition from attorneys general in 15 states and the District of Columbia, who issued a statement Sunday condemning his order as \u201cunconstitutional, un-American and unlawful.\u201d \u00a0 ",

    "text": "WATCH President Trump's Travel Ban Creates Uproar, Draws Protests 0 Shares Email Congressman and Iraq War veteran Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said that President Donald Trump 's executive order on immigration and refugees amounts to \"a Muslim ban,\" despite the administration's assertions that the order aims solely to keep the country safe. \"What he's doing with this Muslim ban just is so wrong and un-American, you see why so many Americans across the country are rising up against it,\" the Democratic representative told ABC News' Martha Raddatz on \"This Week.\" When Raddatz noted, \"They will tell you again and again, it is not a Muslim ban,\" Moulton replied, \"There's no question what's going on here. We're not stupid. We see what Trump is up to.\" On Saturday, Moulton tweeted to President Trump: \"Your #MuslimBan is completely at odds with our most fundamental value: freedom. I'm ashamed that you are our president.\" Moulton also said he believes that Trump's new defense secretary, ret. Gen. James Mattis, does not support the executive order. The order signed Friday immediately suspends immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa -- Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia , Iraq, Iran and Libya -- for 90 days. It also ends for 120 days the entry of any refugees into the U.S., and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees . \"You know, I worked for Gen. Mattis. I know him,\" said Moulton, who as a lieutenant in the U.S. Marines served four tours in Iraq , including two as special assistant to Gen. David Petraeus . Moulton also worked to gain asylum in the U.S. for an Iraqi interpreter who risked his life working with Moulton and fellow U.S. service members. \"There is no way in hell that he is supportive of this,\" the congressman said of Mattis. \"He relied on translators for his life, just like I did. He understands what it means to put your life in the hands of an Iraqi or an Afghan. And he also knows that implicit in that is that they put their lives in our hands, as well, and now we're abandoning them.\" Mattis along with Vice President Mike Pence stood at Trump's side when the president signed the order Friday. Moulton added that he believes the executive order is an indication that Mattis and another former high-ranking military officer in the administration, ret. Gen. John Kelly, the new secretary of homeland security , \"don't have a voice in the Trump administration, that Trump is just doing things for political gain, not in the best interests of our national security .\" The Democratic Massachusetts representative predicted the executive order will be used by terror groups as a recruiting tool and that it won't make the U.S. safer. \"It's fundamentally un-American, and it's also making America less safe. And that's something that Americans need to understand today, is that what Trump is doing is harming our national security. It will incite attacks against us. ISIS is already using this ban as propaganda. And it will prevent us from being able to get the allies that are so critical in our war against terror,\" Moulton said on \"This Week.\" 0 Shares ",

Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. He also intends to talk to Trump about the success of Canada\u2019s refugee policy. Trudeau reacted to Trump\u2019s ban of Muslims from certain countries by tweeting Saturday: \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.\u201d (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press via AP, File) 0 Shares Email Canada will offer temporary residency permits to travelers who become stranded here by President Donald Trump's order banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, the immigration minister said Sunday. Ahmed Hussen, a Somali refugee, was recently named Canada's immigration minister. He said no one is currently stranded at the country's airports by the ban. \"Let me assure those who may be stranded in Canada that I will use my authority as minister to provide them with temporary residency if they need it, as we have done so in the past,\" Hussen said. Hussen said White House officials have offered assurances that permanent Canadian residents can enter the U.S. if they have a valid Canadian permanent resident card and a passport from one of the countries affected. Permanent residents are the equivalent of green card holders in the United States. Dual citizens with a Canadian passport can still enter the U.S. The U.S. State Department had initially said that dual Canadian citizens were included in the ban. But Daniel Jean, Canada's national security adviser, said Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn assured him that dual Canadian citizens are not affected. He said he first learned of the ban on travelers through the news media, and doesn't believe the measure makes the world any safer. Meanwhile, more than 200 leaders of Canada's technology sector signed an open letter urging the federal government to provide working visas to tech workers affected by the Trump administration's action. The letter requests visas allowing people who were working in the sector in the U.S. to now live and work in Canada with access to benefits while they apply for permanent residency, if they choose. Jennifer Moss, who co-founded a Canadian tech company and speaks for an organization called Tech Without Borders, said such visas could help workers who are blocked from returning to U.S. jobs. \"If you're not interested in keeping people that are extremely talented, intelligent, brilliant minds from all around the world, and turning them away at the borders, we're happy to take those people in our country,\" Moss said. 0 Shares ",

Charlie Baker, who said that the \"lack of guidance associated with such an abrupt and overwhelming decision is hugely problematic for all involved.\" Ranking Republicans in the House and Senate have been less sharp in their reactions, however. Speaker Paul Ryan has yet to weigh in on the issue, while Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told ABC on Sunday that he didn't approve of religious tests, but he also didn't want to criticize the administration for \"improving vetting.\" Play ",

Trump took steps Saturday to begin restructuring the White House National Security Council, adding the senior adviser to the principals committee, which includes the secretaries of state and defense. At the same time, Trump said his director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would attend \"where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\" Bannon served in the Navy before attending Harvard Business School, working at Goldman Sachs, starting his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm and later heading the ultraconservative outlet Breitbart News, which has been condemned for featuring racist, sexist and anti-Semitic content. \"He is a former naval officer. He's got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer told ABC's \"This Week.\" Spicer said \"having the chief strategist for the president in those meetings who has a significant military background to help make -- guide what the president's final analysis is going to be is crucial.\" But to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, the NSC \"sadly has some really questionable people on it,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing Bannon among them. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called Bannon's appointment \"a radical departure from any National Security Council in history.\" He told \"Face the Nation\" on CBS: \"The role of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been diminished, I understand, with this reorganization. One person who is indispensable would be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in my view. So, it's of concern, this `reorganization.\"' \u00a0 ",

Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images Switzerland's Roger Federer serves against Spain's Rafael Nadal during the men's singles final on day 14 of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on January 29, 2017. Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images Roger Federer won his 18th Grand Slam title and put some extra distance on the all-time list between himself and Rafael Nadal, the man he beat 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 in a vintage Australian Open final on Sunday night. It was the 35-year-old Federer's first major title since Wimbledon in 2012, his first in Australia since 2010, and it reversed the status quo against his nemesis, Nadal. Both players were returning from extended layoffs \u2014 Federer for six months after Wimbledon with an injured left knee; Nadal for a couple of months with an injured left wrist \u2014 and were seeded 17th and ninth respectively. \"It's been a different last six months, I wasn't sure I was going to make it here but here I am \u2014 we made it,\" Federer said after accepting the trophy from Australian great Rod Laver, who lends his name to the main stadium at Melbourne Park. \"I would have been happy to lose too, to be honest. The comeback was perfect as it was. Tennis is a tough sport, there's no draws. If there was going to be one, I would have been happy to have it tonight and share it with Rafa, really.\" Article continues after sponsorship Federer had lost six of the previous eight Grand Slam finals he'd played against Nadal, and had only previously beaten the left-handed Spaniard in 11 of their 34 matches. Nadal remains equal second with Pete Sampras on the all-time list, with the last of Nadal's 14 majors coming at Roland Garros in 2014. He missed his chance to be the first man in the Open era to win each of the four Grand Slams twice. Instead, Federer became the first man in the Open era to win three Grand Slam titles at least five times (Wimbledon 7 titles, U.S. Open 5, Australian Open 5 and French Open 1). After four sets where the momentum swung alternately from one player to the next, the fifth had all the tension and drama that these two players are famous for. Nadal went up an early break and it seemed as if the injury time-out Federer needed after the fourth set may have been an indicator of things to come. But the Swiss star rallied, and broke back in a pivotal sixth game and took control in a period when he won 10 straight points. Nadal saved three break points in the eighth game but lost momentum again when Federer finished off a 26-shot rally \u2014 the longest of the match \u2014 with a forehand winner down the line. Consecutive forehand errors gave Federer the pivotal break for 5-3, but Nadal made him work for the very last point. Serving for the match, Federer had to save two break points with an ace and a forehand winner. At deuce, he was called for a double-fault but challenged the out call on his second serve. The call was overturned, and he got to play two. Not long after, he fired an ace to get his second match point and hit a forehand crosscourt winner to finish off. His celebrations were delayed, though, when Nadal challenged the call. Federer watched the replay on the tournament screen, and leaped for joy when it showed his last shot was in. His 100th match at the Australian Open ended with his fifth title at Melbourne Park. \"Congratulation to Roger ... Just amazing, the way he's playing after such a long time of him not being on the tour,\" Nadal said. \"For sure, you have been working a lot to make that happen. So congratulations.\" Nadal spent two months recovering from a left wrist injury before heading to Brisbane for a warmup tournament, breaking his usual routine. He reached the quarterfinals there, and had no expectations of reaching the final in Australia. \"I had some hard time not being able to compete in full condition. ... some injuries, well not new for me, but still tough when it happens,\" Nadal said. \"I fight a lot these two weeks. Today, a great match, probably Roger deserved it a little bit more than me.\" No two players had met more often in Grand Slam finals in the Open era, and Nadal had previously dominated. But they hadn't met in a major final since the 2011 French Open, won by Nadal. Three months ago, they were both on breaks when Federer joined Nadal in Mallorca for the opening of the Spaniard's tennis academy and the pair joked about ever being able to contend for majors again. Yet here they were, first Grand Slam tournament of the season, renewing the classic rivalry that saw them dominate tennis a decade ago. The long-odds final \u2014 No. 9 against No. 17 \u2014 unfolded after six-time champion Novak Djokovic was shockingly upset by No. 117-ranked Denis Istomin in the second round and top-ranked Andy Murray, a five-time losing finalist in Australia, went out in the fourth round to left-handed serve-volleyer Mischa Zverev. Serena Williams Defeats Sister Venus To Take 23rd Grand Slam Title Federer beat Zverev in the quarterfinals and U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka in an all-Swiss semifinal to reach the championship match. The six years between his Australian titles set a record, too, longer than the five years that both Boris Becker and Andre Agassi had between championships in Melbourne. It capped a remarkable weekend for 30-somethings \u2014 all four singles finalists were 30 or older \u2014 after Serena Williams beat her sister Venus Williams in the women's final to capture her Open-era record 23rd Grand Slam title.

USA TODAY NETWORK Protesters gather at Copley Square in Boston on Jan. 30, 2017. (Photo: Darren McCollester, Getty Images) Protesters marched, chanted and waved signs\u00a0across the nation Sunday as angry immigrant advocates pressed their demand for an end to President Trump's executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. Rallies underway in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, Los Angeles and other cities\u00a0Sunday drew thousands, part of a groundswell of fury that erupted at\u00a0airports across the nation Saturday\u00a0and showed no signs of abating. \"There is such an energy and anger that I have to do something about it,\" said Jan Rudzinski, of Arden, Del., as she joined\u00a0a rally in Philadelphia where signs said \"Welcome Muslims\" and \"Let them in.\" In Washington, thousands gathered and marched outside the White House. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio joined\u00a0a rally \"for our city's values\" at Battery Park, where Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY, called the ban \"mean-spirited.\" Schumer said Trump's order\u00a0only served to \"embolden and inspire\" terrorists around the world. Thousands of demonstrators thronged Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday, met not only by squads of police in riot gear but by a knot of Trump supporters who stayed across the street, holding signs and American flags and trying to engage the crowd with a loudspeaker. The protests briefly cut off traffic to the busy terminal that serves most international flights, but travelers still made their way through. A line of police separated the groups. Paul Blair, 35, of Los Angeles, held a sign that\u00a0read, \"Cruelty is not strength.\" \"I've never made a sign before in my life,\" he said, but added that he felt \"pretty strongly this is a cruel policy that serves no purpose and doesn't benefit America.\" Another protester, Nahtahna Cabanes, 40, also of Los Angeles, handed out dozens of tamales to the crowd from a large aluminum tray. Cabanes said she found them on a table but that they were not being consumed. So she took it upon herself. \"You've got to feed the revolution, right?\" she said with a smile. At least three protests unfolded in the Detroit area, home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the USA. \"This is where the march became a movement,\" said Phoebe Hopps, one of the Michigan coordinators for last week's\u00a0Women's March on Washington. Hopps, who lives in Traverse City, Mich., scrambled Saturday evening for a permit from the Wayne County Airport Authority. In all, at least five protests took place across Michigan. For Ayah Kutmah, 18, a student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the issue was personal. \"My parents are Syrian,\" she said, having just arrived at the airport Sunday from her hometown of Louisville, Ky. She protested there before she got on her plane, then joined marchers in Detroit when she landed. She held a sign that said \"Welcome\" in English and in Arabic. \"This ban is really personal to me, and to my family.\" I'll be joining New Yorkers at Battery Park this afternoon to stand up for our city's values. See you there. \u2014 Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) January 29, 2017 In Boston, thousands turned out in Copley Square, many holding signs, including\u00a0\"Brown and proud\" and \"No wall no ban.\" \"Can you hear us Washington?!\" tweeted Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. \"We\u2019re standing strong in Boston to support & protect ALL of our people & we will not back down. #NoBanNoWall \" In Virginia,\u00a0the advocacy group CASA's call for a rally\u00a0at\u00a0Dulles International Airport drew dozens of placard-carrying protesters. \u201cWe will not stop until this executive order is canceled and we arrive at common-sense, immigration reform that takes into account the lives of immigrant and refugee families,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0CASA Virginia state director Michelle LaRue said. Protests\u00a0targeted major airports from\u00a0Los Angeles to Chicago to New York. Other demonstrations were taking place in\u00a0town squares and smaller airports from Bangor, Maine, to Bloomington, Ind., to Boise. At San Francisco's airport, hundreds of people choked the international terminal for a second straight day, waving sings that read \"Let Them In\" and \"No Ban No Wall.\" A phalanx of lawyers lined up to offer free legal aid to refugees affected by the executive order. \"I am committed to spending my weekends protesting,\" said Liz Freese-Cabrera, a video producer who attended the Women's March in Washington, D.C. She said she had spent 12 hours protesting at the airport on Saturday. \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 29, 2017 The executive order, signed Friday, suspends entry of all refugees to the U.S. for 120 days, halts admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and bars entry for three months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan,\u00a0Libya,\u00a0Somalia\u00a0and Yemen. Immigration ban fallout: What you need to know Protesters began swarming major airports\u00a0Saturday. In Chicago, thousands of\u00a0demonstrators\u00a0gathered at O'Hare International Airport.\u00a0In New York, more than 2,000 at John F. Kennedy Airport chanted \"Let them in!\" At Los Angeles International Airport, 200 protesters, shouted, \"No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA.\" In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings on Sunday afternoon met with travelers who had been held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, handing them bouquets of white roses and telling reporters, \"The tide is turning and the sun is rising \u2014\u00a0and these important visitors to our city are here. We have wished them welcome and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,\" WFAA-TV reported . Federal Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn granted an\u00a0emergency stay Saturday at the behest of\u00a0immigration\u00a0rights lawyers.\u00a0The judge\u2019s ruling applies to those who have already arrived in the U.S. and those who are in transit who hold valid visas.\u00a0Judges in Massachusetts and Virginia also ordered halts. Moments ago, @JudgeClayJ and I greeted travelers who were detained at @DFWAirport since yesterday. We are very sorry. pic.twitter.com/BHFkpFwNzI \u2014 Mayor Mike Rawlings (@Mike_Rawlings) January 29, 2017 The Department of Homeland Security earlier Sunday shrugged off court rulings, saying they will have little impact on \"overall implementation\" of Trump's order. But Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly late Sunday said in a statement that the entry of lawful permanent residents was \"in the national interest.\" Accordingly, he said, if these people aren't considered to be a threat, their cases will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

    "text": "President Trump signed an \"extreme vetting\" order saying that measures would keep terrorists out of the U.S. and continues to work towards other ... The order was signed on Mr. Trump\u2019s most robust day of national security and foreign policy at the start of his presidency. He met with British Prime Minister Theresa May and had a lengthy phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. As a candidate, Mr. Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to the U.S. He later shifted his focus to putting in place \u201cextreme vetting\u201d procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties. The State Department said the three-month ban in the directive applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen - all Muslim-majority nations. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of the executive order. \u201cThere is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,\u201d Lena F. Masri, the group\u2019s national litigation director. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d During the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000. According to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, he plans to cut that to 50,000. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later. The president was applauded by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said it was \u201ctime to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.\u201d But many Democrats cast the measures as un-American. \u201cTears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Mr. Trump\u2019s order was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day, which brought to mind the global effort to help refugees during World War II and its aftermath. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Joseph Votel. \"The sacrifices are very profound in our fight against terrorists who threaten innocent peoples across the globe,\" he added. A satellite image shows a view of Yemen, where one U.S. soldier was killed and three wounded in a raid Sunday. In addition to the loss of life and injuries, a U.S. aircraft assisting the operation experienced what the Pentagon referred to as a \"hard landing\" close to where the operation was being conducted. Two other service members were injured in the hard landing, U.S. defense officials told NBC News. The aircraft, an MV 22 Osprey, was at a secondary aircraft staging area, not at the raid site and the hard landing was not a result of enemy action, the officials said. The aircraft was unable to fly after the landing, and was destroyed in place by U.S. forces. Yemeni security and tribal officials told the Associated Press the assault, in central Bayda province, killed three senior al Qaeda leaders. They say the Sunday attack killed Abdul-Raouf al-Dhahab, Sultan al-Dhahab, and Seif al-Nims. The al-Dhahab family is considered an ally of al Qaeda. In addition, the officials said some two dozen men had been killed or wounded in the raid, and that U.S. forces captured and departed with at least two men. Play ",

By Joby Warrick By Joby Warrick January 29 at 6:13 PM Follow @jobywarrick Jihadist groups on Sunday celebrated the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying the new policy validates their claim that the United States is at war with Islam. Comments posted to pro-Islamic State social media accounts predicted that President Trump\u2019s executive order would persuade American Muslims to side with the extremists. One posting hailed the U.S. president as \u201cthe best caller to Islam,\u201d while others predicted that Trump would soon launch a new war in the Middle East. \u201c[Islamic State leader Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi has the right to come out and inform Trump that banning Muslims from entering America is a \u2018blessed ban,\u2019\u201d said one posting to a pro-Islamic State channel on Telegram, a social-media platform. The writer compared the executive order to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Islamic militant leaders at the time hailed as a \u201cblessed invasion\u201d that ignited anti-Western fervor across the Islamic world. [ Trump promised disruption. That\u2019s what he\u2019s delivering ] Several postings suggested that Trump was fulfilling the predictions of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American born al-Qaeda leader and preacher who famously said that the \u201cWest would eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201d Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011. \u201cWhen U.S. President Donald Trump says \u2018We don\u2019t want them here\u2019 and bans the Muslim immigrants from Muslim countries, there is one thing that comes to our mind,\u201d said another posting, beneath a banner of al-Awlaki and his quote. Another posting on the Telegram channel \u201cAbu Magrebi\u201d said Trump\u2019s actions \u201cclearly revealed the truth and harsh reality behind the American government\u2019s hatred toward Muslims.\u201d Leaders of the Islamic State speak frequently of their intention to drive a wedge between Western governments and their Muslim populations, and have welcomed outside help \u2014 intentional or not \u2014 in fulfilling that goal. In a 2015 essay in the Islamic State\u2019s English-language magazine Dabiq, the group said that its motivation for launching terrorist attacks in Europe was to provoke an anti-Muslim backlash that would force ambivalent Muslims to enlist with them. \u201cJihadists would have to argue to lengths that Obama, Bush, and others held anti-Islam agendas and hated the religion \u2014 not just radical terrorists,\u201d said Rita Katz, founder of the SITE Intelligence Group, a private organization that monitors jihadist websites. \u201cTrump, however, makes that argument a lot easier for them to sell to their followers.\u201d [ Top Republicans fret about ban\u2019s execution, possible consequences ] The reaction to the ban from Islamic State sympathizers came as current and former U.S. officials also expressed concern that the temporary ban would undermine the global fight against violent Islamic militants. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he worried about the ban\u2019s impact on Muslim troops fighting alongside Americans to destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \u201cThe effect will probably in some areas give ISIS some more propaganda,\u201d McCain told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday, using an acronym for the Islamic State. Robert Richer, a 35-year CIA veteran and former chief of the agency\u2019s Near East division, said the ban was a \u201cstrategic mistake\u201d that could undermine future efforts to recruit spies and collect vital information about terrorists and their plans. How, he asked, can CIA officers persuade Iraqi and Syrian nationals to risk their lives to help the United States? \u201cThis was a win for jihadists and other anti-U.S. forces,\u201d said Richer, the deputy chief of the agency\u2019s Operations Directorate during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cIt fuels the belief out there that Americans are anti-Islam. Otherwise, it accomplishes nothing, because the ones we are most concerned about can still get to the United States.\u201d world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

    "text": "Olympic Runner Mo Farah Unsure How Trump Order May Affect His Return to US By ESPN.com news services via ESPN Jan 29, 2017, 12:46 PM ET 0 Shares Email Four-time Olympic gold-medal-winning runner Mo Farah is concerned that an executive order banning travel to the U.S. for individuals born in certain countries could keep him from returning to his family in Oregon. Farah wrote in a Facebook post Sunday morning that \"President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien.\" sc \"I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years -- working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome,\" Farah wrote. \"It's deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home -- to explain why the President has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice.\" Trump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the United States. It included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. Farah is a British citizen who was born in Somalia. He does not have dual nationality or hold a Somalian passport, but he and his representatives are trying to establish whether the fact he was born in Somalia will present a problem for him when he wishes to return to the United States. Farah's family is living in Portland, Oregon, while he trains in Ethiopia. They have been based in the U.S. for the past six years. The effect of the executive order, focused on seven Muslim-majority countries, has led to uncertainty for a number of foreign-born athletes who compete in the United States as well as questions as to how it affects people with dual citizenship in one of the affected countries. Following conversations between British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the U.S. government, Britain's Foreign Office said later Sunday that Trump's executive order only applies to individuals traveling from one of the seven named countries, regardless of nationality or place of birth. That suggested Farah would be OK to return to the United States. U.S. soccer midfielder Michael Bradley posted his thoughts on the travel ban via Instagram on Sunday morning, saying \"the Muslim ban is just the latest example of someone who couldn't be more out of touch with our country and the right way to move forward.\" Bradley's post follows a Saturday interview with Sports Illustrated's Grant Wahl ?in which he said, \"As a proud American, I hope we can find the right way to move forward in all this and make sure that we're safe but also not lose so many of the things that make the country so great.\" The Homeland Security Department said in a statement Sunday that a New York court order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to Trump's travel ban will not affect the overall implementation of the White House executive action. \"President Trump's Executive Orders remain in place -- prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" the statement said. Protests have sprung up at airports across the country in reaction to the executive order. Farah moved to Britain from Somalia at the age of 8 and is regarded as one of the greatest athletes in British sport after winning the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games and at the 2013 and 2015 world championships. He also won the 5,000-meter gold at the 2011 world championships and was recently given a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II. He wrote, \"My story is an example of what can happen when you follow policies of compassion and understanding, not hate and isolation.\" Information from The Associated Press and the Press Association contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Kennedy International Airport on Jan. 28 in New York City. Protesters demonstrate against the Trump administration's refugee and immigration orders at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Jan. 28 in New York City. (Stephanie Keith / Getty Images) Christi Parsons and Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporters President Trump defended his new immigration crackdown on Sunday as a stand against terrorism that will improve\u00a0American national security, even as the White House appeared to back away from a key element amid the chaos at U.S. airports over the weekend. Trump said in a written statement Sunday afternoon that his crackdown on admissions of travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries had nothing to do with religion but was instead \u201cabout terror and keeping our country safe.\u201d \u201cI have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.\u201d The statement came after the White House \u2014\u00a0facing a backlash from\u00a0lawmakers, including some Republicans \u2014\u00a0appeared to back down on one piece of the\u00a0new immigration order, signaling that travelers trying to enter the country from the\u00a0seven banned countries will be allowed in if they hold green cards. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said that these legal permanent residents are exempt from the travel ban \u201cmoving forward,\u201d even though over the weekend other administration officials said the rule did apply to them. The apparent reversal came amid a national controversy over the new order that temporarily halts the entry of all refugees to the U.S. and any traveler from seven majority-Muslim countries:\u00a0Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\u00a0 Federal judges across the country have blocked parts of the president\u2019s executive action\u00a0since it came down on Friday, mostly preventing the deportation of some travelers who ran into the first wave of implementation. The back-and-forth over the green card holders reflected confusion about the policy, which also indefinitely bars Syrian refugees from entering the U.S.\u00a0 Lawyers for some of the affected immigrants said border agents were applying the rules differently. Further complicating the picture was a statement from the Department of Homeland Security asserting that its agents would enforce all of Trump\u2019s orders while also complying with judicial orders. As some of the orders block deportation, that left individual officers to try and figure out which priorities to honor. In the chaos, Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans waved red flags on Sunday, warning the administration to slow down and make sure the tough new rules were implemented with deliberation. U.S.  Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) blasted the Trump executive order for what they said was a \u201chasty\u201d implementation. \u201cIt is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted,\u201d McCain and Graham said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. \u201cSuch a hasty process risks harmful results,\u201d the senators said. \u201cWe should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.\u201d Trump fired back with a late-afternoon tweet, saying their statement was \u201cwrong\u201d and that they are \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer\u00a0said Democrats will introduce legislation as soon as Monday to stop the president\u2019s\u00a0actions. House Democrats are taking similar legislative action, and lawmakers from both chambers will rally Monday evening at the Supreme Court to protest Trump's orders. \"This executive order was mean-spirited and un-American,\" said Schumer, the New York Democrat, choking up as he stood with immigrants and refugees at a news conference\u00a0Sunday. \"It must be reversed immediately.\" Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats\u00a0are exploring legal options, including an amicus\u00a0brief in support of the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union\u00a0against\u00a0the actions. But the chances of passing a bill through the Republican-controlled Congress are slim, as most\u00a0GOP leaders and lawmakers have not objected to Trump's ban. White House officials on Sunday defended the Trump plan, insisting he took great care in crafting it. If the announcement came as a surprise to many, they say, that was by design. The White House did not want to tell too many people about it in advance, thinking that too much notice would compromise the strategy, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said. \u201cThe people that needed to know, knew,\u201d he said Sunday on ABC. \u201cThe appropriate leadership was notified.\u201d Still\u00a0the confusion over the particulars was significant \u2014 especially on the question of the green cards. In explaining the new order, administration officials on Saturday told reporters\u00a0that the green card holders from the seven banned countries would have to get waivers in order to return to the U.S. after traveling outside the country. Speaking on condition of anonymity to reporters on Saturday, the White House official said green card holders from one of the seven affected countries who are currently outside the U.S.\u00a0would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the U.S., according to a pool reporter who was present. Those green card holders in the United States would have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, the official said. On Sunday, Priebus said otherwise. \u201cAs far as green card holders, moving forward, it doesn\u2019t affect them,\u201d Priebus told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd in an interview, adding that border officials still retain \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d to hold people from the suspect countries before letting them enter the U.S. The interpretation of the new rules continued in foreign capitals, with British officials announcing publicly that they had gotten clarification from the U.S. government regarding U.S.-bound travelers from their country. \u201cIf you are a U.K. national who happens to be traveling from one of those [banned]\u00a0countries to the U.S., then the order does not apply to you, even if you were born in one of those countries,\" British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in a statement to British citizens. The only dual nationals who might have extra checks are those coming from one of the seven countries themselves, for example, a U.K.-Libya dual national coming from Libya to the U.S., Johnson\u2019s statement said. The White House did not immediately confirm the British summary.

Meanwhile, even some Republican lawmakers questioned the new policy, and anti-Trump protesters congregated in airports and public spaces coast-to-coast, including Lafayette Square in front of the White House. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, speaking on NBC's Meet The Press , appeared to ease part of the order by saying that it \"doesn't affect green card holders moving forward.\" Priebus said border agents do have the authority to \"ask a few more questions\" of people returning from suspicious countries, even if they have a green card giving them resident status in the United States. If people \"shouldn't be in this country they're going to be detained,\" Priebus told NBC. \"And, so, (we) apologize for nothing here.\" Trump's order late Friday banning refugees from seven Muslim Middle East countries \u2014\u00a0Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen \u2014\u00a0set off protests at airports nationwide and triggered lawsuits. Prior to the judicial rulings, Trump's order took effect immediately, leaving many foreign nationals and green card holders stuck at overseas locations or U.S. airports. Their fate on a case-by-case basis remains unclear. Presidential counselor\u00a0Kellyanne Conway, appearing on Fox News Sunday, said people who have\u00a0been held up are being given screenings and will be released if they are not considered terrorist threats. She also said the order by the Brooklyn judge \u2014 an \"Obama appointee\" \u2014 doesn't apply to the anti-terrorism goal of the Trump order. \"It's preventing, not detaining,\" Conway said, calling the detentions \"a small price to pay\" for security. Democrats and some Republicans said the order amounts to a Muslim ban, and will help the Islamic State cast their activities as a religious war against the West. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., also appearing on Fox News Sunday, said Middle East refugees, particularly those from war-torn Syria, are already the most \"carefully vetted\" visitors to the United States. Durbin also noted that Trump issued his order with little or no consultations among the government officials who have to carry it out, leading to all the weekend confusion. \"It was an impulsive move by the president,\" Durbin told Fox. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump, tweeted: \"I stand with the people gathered across the country tonight defending our values & our Constitution. This is not who we are.\" Read more: ",

Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and \u201cthey said we\u2019ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,\u201d according to Mr. Connolly. \u201cI said that\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That\u2019s where the problem is, and that\u2019s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable.\u201d The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to \u201cclaw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The mayors of Dallas, Chicago and Boston spoke out as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. \u201cWe have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,\u201d he said. The order roiled relations with America\u2019s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone on Saturday, said she reminded him of the obligation of the United States to take refugees under the Geneva Conventions . Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Sunday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did \u201cnot agree with this kind of approach.\u201d The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump\u2019s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. \u201cShame,\u201d they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d \u201cNo hate, no fear,\u201d they added later. \u201cRefugees are welcome here.\u201d Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from inauguration day prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. \u201cThis executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,\u201d Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. \u201cThat is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles and David Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the issue. \u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d said Brian Hooks, co-chairman of the Kochs\u2019 donor network. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive.\u201d Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was \u201cpoorly implemented\u201d and urged the president to \u201cmake appropriate revisions.\u201d Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. \u201cThey are sadly weak on immigration,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSenators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Michael D.

Lawyers from around Chicago showed up to assist any immigrant having problems. (Chris Sweda) Stacy St. Clair and Grace Wong Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune An email blast went out after lunch Saturday, calling for lawyers to help people being held at O'Hare International Airport in the wake of President Donald Trump 's immigration order. Julia Schlozman received the message just a few hours after signing up to volunteer with the International Refugee Assistance Project. After quickly reading through the email, she hopped on a CTA bus and then grabbed the Blue Line to O'Hare. An attorney who specializes in criminal justice reform, Schlozman has never practiced immigration law. But she went anyway, believing her research skills, brainstorming ability and enthusiasm could somehow help. \"I wanted to contribute in any way I could,\" she said. \"I just felt like I had to do something.\" She wasn't the only Chicago-area lawyer with that feeling. About 150 attorneys showed up at O'Hare on Saturday to help secure the release of more than a dozen travelers held as part of Trump's crackdown on immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. They threw their weekend plans away, rescheduling family outings, ignoring household chores and canceling restaurant reservations to assist clients they had never met nor would ever bill. Immigration attorney Maria Baldini-Potermin was catching up on work at her office when she received the email. Wearing yoga pants and a Girl Scouts T-shirt, she headed straight to the airport. Attorneys assisting family of detainees at O'Hare Mohammad Amirisefat of Chicago waits for news about relatives at O'Hare International Airport on Jan.\u00a028, 2017. His sister, Zehra Amirisefat, 30, a U.S. citizen, landed at O'Hare with her 6-month-old child on a return trip from\u00a0Iran and\u00a0her husband, a green card holder, was detained.

His sister, Zehra Amirisefat, 30, a U.S. citizen, landed at O'Hare with her 6-month-old child on a return trip from\u00a0Iran and\u00a0her husband, a green card holder, was detained. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) See more videos \"The Chicago Bar is responding to the challenge,\" she said. \"It's inspiring to see.\" Armed with laptops and iPads, the attorneys looked like \"The Paper Chase\" cavalry as they commandeered the dining area directly across from the McDonald's kiosk in the international terminal. The initial email quickly made its way to social media, leading to an overflow legal crowd in the O'Hare food court by 6 p.m. The travelers were not formally detained, which prevented the attorneys from speaking with them. Instead, the lawyers gleaned as much information as they could from the travelers' family members who were waiting anxiously at O'Hare. They shared that information with local congressional offices in the hopes that the elected officials could persuade the Department of Homeland Security to release them. While some attorneys lobbied Congress, others teamed up to work on legal briefs, do research or walk through the terminal with signs offering legal assistance. ",

Chris Walter/WireImage/Getty Images Geoff Nicholls, Black Sabbath's keyboardist for 25 years between 1979 and 2004, died today from lung cancer at the age of 68. Nicholls' passing was first confirmed by Black Sabbath's founding guitarist Tony Iommi via social media : I'm so saddened to hear the loss of one of my dearest and closest friends Geoff Nicholls. He's been suffering for a while now with lung cancer and he lost his battle this morning. Geoff and I have always been very close and he has been a real true friend to me and supported me all the way for nearly 40 years. I will miss him dearly and he will live in my heart until we meet again. Rest In Peace my dear friend. Tony Ozzy Osbourne also posted a remembrance of his longtime collaborator: Geoff Nicholls was a great friend of mine for a long time. He will be greatly missed. I'm very saddened at the news. As did bassist Geezer Butler: Very sad to hear of old friend and Sabbath keyboard player Geoff Nicholls passing. RIP Geoff. Article continues after sponsorship Nicholls first collaborated with Iommi during his time in Quartz, which shared with Sabbath a hometown (Birmingham) and whose self-titled debut record Iommi produced around 1977. Nicholls would join Sabbath, at the behest of Iommi, after Ronnie James Dio had replaced Osbourne as lead singer (at the suggestion of Osbourne's future wife, Sharon). After leaving Sabbath following the band's choice of Adam Wakeman as keyboardist in 2004, Nicholls joined another former Sabbath singer, Tony Martin, in his band Headless Cross in recent years. ",

President Trump signed an executive order Friday that bans legal U.S. residents and visa-holders from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. for 90 days and puts an indefinite hold on a program resettling Syrian refugees. (Photo: Genna Martin, seattlepi via AP) For now at least, this might be our new normal. One week after a massive\u00a0Women's March on Washington and similar marches across the world in defiance of President Trump and concerns over a rollback of rights, a rising tide of outrage again sent Americans into city streets. The first ripples began with\u00a0protests at about a dozen airports Saturday over Trump's executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. From Seattle to Newark, Houston to Boston, hundreds jammed airport terminals \u2014 lawyers,\u00a0immigration advocates, ordinary citizens compelled to the front lines, many refusing to leave\u00a0until those who had been detained by U.S. Customs had been freed or had obtained legal counsel. On Sunday, the movement caught fire and demonstrations\u00a0and rallies erupted in communities\u00a0across the U.S. from city halls to airports to parks.\u00a0In the nation's capital, the site of the march that drew\u00a0a crushing 500,000 people Jan. 21,\u00a0Pennsylvania Avenue was shut down Sunday as thousands trekked\u00a0from the White House to the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0An energized crowd\u00a0stopped outside Trump's showcase hotel along the avenue to shake fists and chant \"shame.\" Big crowd marching down Pennsylvania Ave in Washington D.C. in protest of #Trump 's #MuslimBan . h/t: @jerrysaltz pic.twitter.com/I4eYlp1F8w \u2014 Jacob Goldstein (@GoldsteinStreet) January 29, 2017 Boston Boston's Copley Square, the public square packed with runners when\u00a0bombs exploded at the Boston Marathon in 2013, was a sea of signs and electrified demonstrators hoisting placards\u00a0saying \"deport hate\" and \"immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers, we will stand with you.\" Copley Square in Boston right now.

Signs blared \"resist,\" \"1939/2017 never again\" and \"due process for all.\" A phalanx of lawyers lined up, offering free legal aid to refugees affected by the executive order.

College campuses were also spurred to action\u00a0Sunday. At the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, hundreds of students and community\u00a0members flocked to the Rotunda, the esteemed centerpiece of Thomas Jefferson's university. They chanted\u00a0\u2014 \"2, 4, 6, 8, we don't want your wall of hate\" \u2014 and read\u00a0an open letter on behalf of DREAMers on Ground,\u00a0a student organization dedicated to undocumented students.

Demonstrators filled\u00a0the park, some\u00a0shouting\u00a0slogans such as \"no hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.\"\u00a0 As the crowd continued to balloon through the afternoon, the office of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio\u00a0tweeted: \"We stand with the 5,000 (and growing!) New Yorkers in Battery Park.\" Not long after, came an addendum:\u00a0\"Make that 10,000 (and growing!)\" There is something more important and powerful than all three branches of government.

By Glenn Kessler By Glenn Kessler January 29 at 6:15 PM Follow @GlennKesslerWP President Trump signed an executive order halting all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days, among other provisions. Here's what the order says. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) \u201cMy policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.\u201d \u2014President Trump, statement on executive order, Jan. 29, 2017 In justifying his controversial executive order halting travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, President Trump claimed that President Barack Obama did the same thing in 2011. But the comparison is a bit\u00a0facile. Here\u2019s what happened in 2011. The Facts The only news report that we could find that referred to a six-month ban was a 2013 ABC News article that included this line: \u201cAs a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News \u2013 even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets.\u201d The \u201cKentucky case\u201d refers to two Iraqis in Kentucky who in May, 2011 were arrested and faced federal terrorism charges after officials discovered from an informant that Waad Ramadan Alwan, before he had been granted asylum in the United States, had constructed improvised roadside bombs in Iraq. The FBI, after examining fragments from thousands of bomb parts, found Alwan\u2019s fingerprints on a cordless phone that had been wired to detonate an improvised bomb in 2005. The arrests caused in uproar in Congress and the Obama administration pledged to re-examine the records of 58,000 Iraqis who had been settled in the United States. The administration also imposed new, more extensive background checks on Iraqi refugees. Media reports at the time focused on how the new screening procedures had delayed visa approvals, even as the United States was preparing to end its involvement in the Iraq war. \u201cThe enhanced screening procedures have caused a logjam in regular visa admissions from Iraq, even for those who risked their lives to aid American troops and who now fear reprisals as the Obama administration winds down the U.S. military presence,\u201d the Baltimore Sun reported. The Los Angeles Times reported that U.S. official acknowledged delays, but were trying to speed up the process: A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad, speaking on condition he not be identified, acknowledged \u201cunfortunate delays\u201d in issuing special visas, the result of enhanced security clearance procedures, some instituted after the Kentucky arrests. But he said recent changes would speed the process. The State Department\u2019s National Visa Center has been ordered to flag special visa applications for expedited action, the official said. And a requirement that Iraqi applicants provide an original signature on certain forms sent to the U.S. has been dropped after Iraqis complained of logistical difficulties. \u201cWe are making changes, ordered at the very highest levels, that will help shave time off the application process,\u201d the official said. At a September, 2011 congressional hearing, Sen. Susan Collins asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano if there had been a hold placed on Iraqi visa applications. COLLINS: \u201cSo my question is, is there a hold on that population until they can be more stringently vetted to ensure that we\u2019re not letting into this country, people who would do us harm?\u201d NAPOLITANO: \u201cYep. Let me, if I might, answer your question two parts. First part, with respect to the 56, 57,000 who were resettled pursuant to the original resettlement program, they have all been revetted against all of the DHS databases, all of the NCTC [National Counter Terrorism Center] databases and the Department of Defense\u2019s biometric databases and so that work has not been done and focused.\u201d COLLINS: \u201cThat\u2019s completed?\u201d NAPOLITANO: \u201cThat is completed. Moving forward, no one will be resettled without going through the same sort of vet. Now I don\u2019t know if that equates to a hold, as you say, but I can say that having done the already resettled population moving forward, they will all be reviewed against those kinds of databases.\u201d The new rules were stringent, The Economist reported, and it resulted in some turmoil. \u201cImmigration authorities soon began rechecking all Iraqi refugees in America, reportedly comparing fingerprints and other records with military and intelligence documents in dusty archives. About 1,000 soon-to-be immigrants in Iraq were told that they would not be allowed to board flights already booked. Some were removed from planes. Thousands more Iraqi applicants had to restart the immigration process, because their security clearances expired when the program stalled. Men must now pass five separate checks, women four, and children three.\u201d State Department records show there was a significant drop in refugee arrivals from Iraq in 2011. There were 18,251 in 2010, 6,339 in 2011 and 16,369 in 2012.\u00a0But it\u2019s unclear that equates to an actual six-month pause in visa processing, rather than a dramatic slowdown in approvals as new rules were put in place. One news report said \u201cpace of visa approvals having slowed to a crawl,\u201d indicating some were still being approved. The Pinocchio Test So what\u2019s the difference with Trump\u2019s action? First, Obama responded to an actual threat\u2014the discovery that two Iraqi refugees has been implicated in bomb-making in Iraq that had targeted U.S. troops. (Iraq, after all, had been a war zone.) Under congressional pressure, officials decided to reexamine all previous refugees and also impose new screening procedures, which led to a slowdown in processing new applications. Trump, by contrast, issued his executive order without any known triggering threat. Second, Obama did not announce\u00a0there was a ban on visa applications. In fact, as seen in Napolitano\u2019s answer to Collins, administration officials danced around that question. There was certainly a lot of news reporting that visa applications had been slowed to a trickle. But the Obama administration never said it was their policy to halt all applications. Even so, the delays\u00a0did not go unnoticed, so there was a lot of critical news reporting at the time about the angst of Iraqis waiting for approval. Third, Obama\u2019s policy did not prevent all citizens of that country, including green-card holders, from traveling the United States. Trump\u2019s policy is much more sweeping, though officials have appeared to pull back from barring permanent U.S. residents. We have sought comment from the White House and also from Obama administration officials and so may update this if more information becomes available. But so far this is worthy of at least Two Pinocchios. Two Pinocchios ",

Chuck Schumer, D-NY, speaks during a press conference to push for an overturn of President Trump's executive order temporarily banning immigration to the United States for refugees and some Muslim travelers, at a press conference Jan.\u00a029, 2017, in New York.\u00a0 (Bryan R. Smith / AFP/Getty Images) David Weigel, Ed O'KeefeThe Washington Post Democrats spent the weekend building a full-scale opposition push against President Donald Trump 's executive order banning entry into the United States for refugees, migrants and even green-card holders from seven mostly Muslim countries. On Saturday night, elected officials and candidates for Democratic National Committee leadership positions joined protesters at airports around the country. On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) fought back tears as he announced that Democrats would introduce legislation to stop the order. \"This executive order was mean-spirited and un-American,\" he said, flanked by refugees at a news conference in New York. \"Look at these faces! Are they any kind of threat to America? No, they're the promise of America.\" Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., are inviting all Democratic lawmakers to join them at 6 p.m. Monday on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court to show solidarity with legal attempts to block Trump's travel ban. And in an interview, Sen. Chris Murphy , D-Conn., said he would introduce legislation to overturn Trump's order by forcing him to comply with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which banned discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin. \"I think ultimately this ban will be struck down by the courts, but we need to put legislation on the table that Republicans could support, that overturns the ban,\" Murphy said. \"(The president) clearly campaigned on this ban, but the fact that he put no thought into how it was drafted or how it would be implemented is incredibly dangerous.\" Given that stance, Murphy said, Democrats must \"force a debate\" this week on Trump's order by slowing consideration of the president's remaining Cabinet nominees, especially Rex Tillerson, his choice to serve as the next secretary of state. White House on Sunday afternoon protesting against President Donald Trump 's refugee ban, which stranded scores of travelers at U.S. airports Saturday before being partially lifted by a federal judge.

Hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the White House on Sunday afternoon protesting against President Donald Trump 's refugee ban, which stranded scores of travelers at U.S. airports Saturday before being partially lifted by a federal judge. Demonstrators lined Pennsylvania Avenue and packed... (Faiz Siddiqui, Michael Laris, Michael Alison Chandler) \"We should take every ounce of time that we're allowed on these nominees, to talk about the disaster that has been the first week of this administration, especially when it comes to foreign policy,\" he said. Schumer and Democrats are eager to move quickly because they believe there is a rare opportunity to ride a wave of GOP opposition to Trump's moves. Democrats argue that one of the only ways they can influence policymaking in the next two years is to drive a wedge between Trump and members of his own party. At his news conference, Schumer said he believed legislation could easily move through the Senate given the growing opposition from key Republicans, including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and others. (Jerry Markon, Katherine Shaver) Details of the legislative proposals were still being sorted out Sunday afternoon, but most are likely to be introduced by Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has oversight of refugee and immigrants' rights issues, aides said. Schumer was working to coordinate the proposals Sunday; Murphy said he had received a call from the leader early in the day to confer. Democratic leaders were also exploring the options for holding more public events to draw attention to the opposition to Trump's orders - with the party seeking to once again tap into the anger that has driven millions of Americans into the streets. Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., who has taken a leading role in Democratic messaging, said Sunday that the Senate needs \"to pass legislation immediately which effectively rescinds Trump's un-American and unconstitutional ban on people from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States\" and to slow the nomination process. \"Almost without exception, Trump's Cabinet nominees are extremely controversial and way outside of the American mainstream,\" Sanders said. \"In my view, the Senate needs to take as much time as possible on the floor for a full discussion and debate about each of these nominees.\" For the party's restive base, that fight - just nine days into the new president's term - could not come soon enough. While Democrats have embraced the protests against Trump and Republican policies, and while some helped organize more than 70 rallies on Jan. 15 against repeal of the Affordable Care Act, progressives have criticized the party for not voting en masse against Trump's Cabinet picks. \"You better show up ready to do real work on Monday after all this pro bono work we, the people, did for you on our day off,\" said CNN host W. Kamau Bell in a Saturday night tweet. In several cases, Democratic lawmakers took one of the most basic steps available to them as members of Congress: They provided services for constituents. Reps. Jerrold Nadler , D-N.Y., and Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, D-N.Y., who represent parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, showed up at John F. Kennedy International Airport and helped activists and attorneys seek the quick release of green-card holders and refugees stuck in legal limbo after their arrival. In Houston, where the candidates for DNC roles participated in the second of four \"future forums,\" activists filled a ballroom at Texas Southern University to ask why Democrats were not doing more. One attendee could be heard shouting, \"Elizabeth Warren sold us out,\" a reference to her committee vote in favor of Ben Carson's nomination to become secretary for health and human services. On Saturday afternoon, before the protests had gotten fully underway, some of the Houston event's biggest cheers came when the candidates were asked whether they would oppose all of Trump's nominees - something no Democrat has done. \"With what we have seen in the last seven days, I think we may be underreacting,\" South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said. \"We've got refugees who were vetted more than the Trump Cabinet was vetted,\" said former labor secretary Thomas Perez . Rep. Keith Ellison , D-Minn., the first Muslim member of Congress, said that the party needs to follow the lead of activists and that those activists are needed for direct action against Trump. \"It is street action that creates the economic and social conditions for legislation to get passed,\" Ellison said. After the forum, Buttigieg joined Perez and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison at the protests breaking out at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. \"We knew this would be a day of reckoning when Donald Trump assumed the Oval Office,\" Perez said to protesters. \"Lady Liberty has taken a few body punches, but the American people will fight back.\" By Saturday night, many more elected Democrats were joining protests - and enabling them. After the Port Authority suspended the AirTrain that transports people from New York's subway to JFK Airport, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, D-N.Y., reversed its decision. Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. , D-Pa., showed up at Philadelphia's airport in a tuxedo, having left a formal event to help local elected officials negotiate with customs officers to see stranded immigrants and refugees. At Dulles International Airport , Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J., did the same - to little avail. At Boston's Logan International Airport, Warren delivered a speech against Trump's order that was amplified by the crowd, a \"people's microphone\" that had been used by the Occupy Wall Street movement. And Sen. Kamala Harris , D-Calif., joined marchers protesting Trump's travel ban outside the White House on Sunday afternoon. Booker, Harris and Warren, considered possible Democratic presidential contenders in 2020, had cast three of just 11 \"no\" votes against Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly. Murphy noted that the Senate quickly confirmed James Mattis , the revered former Marine general, to serve as defense secretary \"because he assured us that he was going to argue against the very ban he watched Trump sign.\" At a summer 2016 roundtable, Mattis had said the idea of a \"Muslim ban\" would make actors in the Middle East think America had \"completely lost it.\" \"Many of us gave the president and his Cabinet a little benefit of the doubt last week,\" Murphy said. \"I don't see that there's any reason that that should continue. Almost every single one of these nominees try to prop up their nomination by contradicting Trump in their confirmation hearing. It's pretty clear now that Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are running this administration and the nominees that have been confirmed thus far have been marginalized.\" By Sunday afternoon, nearly every congressional Democrat had condemned the executive order, including Sen. Heidi Heitkamp , D-N.D., who faces a 2018 re-election campaign in a state Trump carried by 35 points. None defended it, but several remained silent. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly , D-Va., a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cautioned that Democrats can only do so much to try to stop Trump, given their diminished powers on Capitol Hill. \"We're going to have to pick our battles in the next two years because we don't have the majority,\" he said. \"There are so many moving parts here, and we need to prioritize what we respond to and what we propound. We have to be proactively propounding an alternative vision that recalls American core values.\" In the House, Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif., a longtime advocate for immigrant and refugees' rights, is set to introduce a bill this week that would block implementation of Trump's order, according to senior House aides. And Pelosi informed colleagues Sunday afternoon that among the options her caucus would consider is filing an amicus brief in support of the American Civil Liberties Union if legal cases to block or reverse Trump's travel ban reach the Supreme Court. Connolly said that he and many other Democrats have been stunned by how organically Americans have been drawn into the streets to protest Trump's early decisions as president. Just days after the Jan. 21 Women's March on Washington, 200 more people than usual showed up at a regular meeting of the Fairfax County Democratic Party. \"That's a sign,\" he said. \"And there are all kinds of people networking and asking the question, 'What can I do?' There's not a sense of 'Throw up your hands, our fate is sealed.' It's quite the opposite. It wasn't a feckless, powerless act. It was a call to arms. And I believe it's going to lead to mass organizing across the country to resist this constitutional assault.\" ",

Attorneys struggled to determine how many people were affected by the rules, which Mr. Trump said Saturday were \u201cworking out very nicely.\u201d But critics described widespread confusion, with travelers being held in legal limbo because of ill-defined procedures. Some lawyers manned tables at New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport to offer help to families with detained relatives. Demonstrators denounce president's order which blocks refugees from entering the country and imposes ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority nat... \u201cWe just simply don\u2019t know how many people there are and where they are,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. Advocates for travelers say they did not have clear picture about what\u2019s happening and that the chaos is likely to continue. The executive director of National Immigration Law Center, Marielena Hincapie, said \u201cthis is just the beginning.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really in a crisis mode, a constitutional crisis mode in our country, and we\u2019re going to need everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is definitely one of those all-hands-on-deck moments.\u201d Protests were planned or underway Sunday, including one in suburban Chicago organized by Jewish groups to show support for Muslims, as well as at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., and Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Thousands of protesters streamed into New York City\u2019s Battery Park, gathering Sunday near the ferries that carry tourists to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, the place where 12 million people entered the United States in the golden age of immigration.

Schumer also appeared alongside refugees and their families to denounce the ban at a press conference in New York City late Sunday morning, CBS New York reported. \u201cDonald Trump seems to want us to believe that immigrants are terrorists and criminals but look at these families, they are the promise of America,\u201d Schumer said. \u00a0 In Washington, massive crowds gathered at the White House Sunday to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, CBS affiliate WUSA reported. #BREAKING : Massive crowds have gathered at the White House to protest @POTUS immigration plan.

But confusion remained about who could stay and who will be kept out of the country in the coming weeks. Federal courts in Virginia, Massachusetts and Washington state took similar action. Michigan\u2019s civil rights chief, Agustin Arbulu, condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s order, saying he hoped the federal court ruling would led him to narrow its scope. \u201cDuring this time of uncertainty and confusion, we urge everyone to act with restraint and not in ways that foster fear and division,\u201d Arbulu said. Criticism also continued abroad. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini, lashed out at Mr. Trump on Sunday, insisting that instead of building walls, the continent will \u201ccelebrate\u201d every wall which is torn down and \u201cevery new bridge that is built up.\u201d Among those caught in limbo: Iraqis who had been promised a life in America because of their service to the U.S. military, frail and elderly travelers from Iran and Yemen, and longtime U.S. residents traveling abroad who don\u2019t know if they will be allowed to return home. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? What\u2019s going to happen next?\u201d asked Mohammed al Rawi, an Iraqi-born American citizen in the Los Angeles area, after his 69-year-old father, coming to visit his grandchildren in California, was abruptly detained and sent back to Iraq after 12 hours in custody. \u201cAre they going to create camps for Muslims and put us in it?\u201d On Saturday, large protests erupted at airports throughout the country where travelers were being held, a day after Mr. Trump signed the order banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. Mr. Trump also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. An official with the Department of Homeland Security who briefed reporters by phone said 109 people who were in transit on airplanes had been denied entry and 173 had not been allowed to get on their planes overseas.

One woman, a visual artist from Yemen who is working in the United States on a green card, held a sign that read, \u201cI spit in Trump\u2019s hummus\u201d and wore a red, white and blue scarf around her head. \u2014 NICHOLAS FANDOS \u2022 Boston: A young woman in Copley Square held a sign that read: \u201cDear Donald. Me again. Marching for my immigrant husband and my Muslim friends. Back off! Claire.\u201d Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, issued a statement saying that he was discussing with members of the academic, medical and research sectors here how to minimize the risks that a ban on immigrants and refugees posed to their institutions. \u2014 KATHARINE Q. SEELYE \u2022 San Francisco: Lawyers stood in the international arrivals terminal of the airport offering free assistance to those awaiting detained family members.

Lawyers said that nine people from Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria were still detained at midday, and that those being held had immigrant or tourist visas. \u2014 PATRICK McGEE \u2022 Phoenix: Outside Terminal 4, the busiest at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Syma Hamidi and Seemee Siddiqi, Muslim immigrants from Pakistan who work as doctors in Phoenix, wore a hijab to make a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually use this,\u201d Dr. Hamidi said, tugging at a black-and-white scarf. \u201cWe have it on because we want to make clear that we\u2019re here, and that the country we love is a country that accepts us all.\u201d They joined a few hundred protesters at the airport in Arizona. \u2014 FERNANDA SANTOS \u2022 Detroit: At least 2,000 people rallied outside of Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Sunday, according to some crowd estimates.

From New York to Phoenix, tens of thousands of people voiced their solidarity with refugees and Muslims. By MEGAN SPECIA on Publish Date January 29, 2017. Photo by Bryan Anselm for The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Trump: Ban is \u2018not about religion,\u2019 but safety President Trump issued a statement defending the travel ban at 4:30 p.m., saying that it was not a ban on Muslims and was not about religion, but was about \u201cterror and keeping our country safe.\u201d The ban, he said, was similar to action taken by President Obama in 2011 when visas for Iraqi refugees \u2014 even those who risked their lives to help the American war effort \u2014 were all but halted . Advertisement Continue reading the main story Here is full text of President Trump\u2019s statement: America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. Priebus says those with green cards will not be turned away Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, seemed to soften the president\u2019s immigration order on Sunday, saying that people who hold green cards will not be prevented from returning to the United States, even if they are from one of the seven mostly Muslim countries covered by the new travel ban. Even so, Mr. Priebus said that border agents had \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d to detain and question suspicious travelers from certain countries. On Sunday, many travelers remained detained. Federal judges in four states have issued orders halting provisions of the ban. Trump calls McCain and Graham \u2018sadly weak\u2019 for criticizing ban President Trump struck back on Twitter at two leading Republican Senators who criticized the travel ban . \u201cSadly weak on immigration,\u201d the president said of Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who had written that they feared the ban \u201cwill become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration.

Credit Michael Stravato for The New York Times Some detainees at airports are released Travelers being held at airports around the country continued to be released on Sunday, while some had already been sent back and others were not allowed onto their flights to the United States. The number of people still in custody at Kennedy Airport was a floating target on Sunday night. Rep. Joe Crowley, a Queens Democrat, said that based on his meeting with a Customs and Border Protection agent that concluded at around 8 p.m., six people were still being held at the airport\u2019s Terminal 1. All six have green cards, he said, and will be processed and released under terms of the judicial stay within a few hours. Five of the six are from a single flight from Turkey. Crowley said he did not know the flight on which the sixth arrived. Crowley called the executive order \u201chorrible and immoral.\u201d But a lawyer organizing aid for detainees and their families said that as many as 52 people had been detained at the airport over the weekend, based on contact with families and other sources. As many as 20 were still detained and two had been deported as of Sunday evening, she said. \u2014 SEAN PICCOLI Yassin Abdelrhman, 76, was embraced by his son, Mohammed Suliman, 37, at Kennedy Airport to cheers from onlookers that included a scrum of pro bono lawyers on Sunday. Mr. Suliman, a British citizen, had traveled to Sudan to bring his father to the United States. But while Mr. Suliman was allowed to enter the country, his father had been detained since 8 a.m. on Saturday. \u201cI am so tired,\u201d Mr. Suliman said. \u201cIt has been a long journey.\u201d His father did not speak. \u2014 RUTH BASHINSKY Samira Asgari, 30, an Iranian citizen who was scheduled to fly to Boston on Saturday morning to start a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School, was told in Frankfurt on Saturday that she could not board the plane. \u201cI was pretty excited to join @soumya_boston\u2019s lab but denied boarding due to my Iranian nationality,\u201d she posted on Twitter . \u201cFeeling safer?\u201d Dr. Asgari had recently completed her Ph.D. in Switzerland and was planning to study the genetic roots of why people respond differently to tuberculosis infections. \u2013 AMY HARMON Iman Hussain, 50, was reunited with her two daughters, Elaf, 25, and Anfal, 23, at Kennedy Airport after being detained for more than 30 hours.

(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The leaders of the conservative network aligned with billionaires Charles Koch and David Koch on Sunday said they opposed President Trump\u2019s controversial ban on immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries. \"We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d Brian Hooks, a co-chairman of the Kochs\u2019 seminar network, said in a statement. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,\u201d Hooks added, saying it hinders a Koch goal of promoting a free and open society. The statement marks the first public criticism of the Trump administration from the Kochs, who oversee one of the most influential outside operations in conservative politics with a staff, budget and voter-turnout operation that rivals the Republican Party. Charles Koch, 81, refused to support Trump\u2019s candidacy and had denounced the Republican\u2019s proposed ban on Muslims during the campaign as \u201creminiscent of Nazi Germany.\u201d Koch did not refer to either Trump or his\u00a0immigration order during public remarks Sunday afternoon to the more than 550 ultra-wealthy donors gathered at a luxury resort in the California desert for the network\u2019s annual winter summit. During the meeting, however, Koch leaders stressed they were willing to work with the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. They also indicated they would throw their political might into opposing Republicans, if they bucked the network on key priorities, such as reducing government spending and regulations. \u201cWe see big opportunities to work with the new administration and this new Congress,\u201d Hooks said. \u201cIt\u2019s this network\u2019s unique role to hold all politicians accountable, regardless of political party.\u201d He warned of a dramatic swing back to the left in upcoming elections if Republicans lost sight of the economic worries that drove voters to Trump. Likely flash points with the GOP include $1 trillion infrastructure plan Trump pushed during the campaign and a possible plan to impose a 20% border tax on imports from Mexico that the network's leaders say will drive up costs for consumers. \u201cA $1 trillion government stimulus is a bad idea under Democrats and it\u2019s a bad idea for a Republican,\u201d Hooks said to loud applause from the audience that filled that ballroom of the Renaissance Indian Wells Resort and Spa. Although network did not engage in the presidential race, its donors spent heavily to shape 2016 federal and state elections. All but one of their favored U.S. Senate candidates, Nevada\u2019s Joe Heck, won, helping the GOP retain control of the chamber. Over the weekend, Koch officials said they intend to raise and spend $300 million to\u00a0$400 million to influence policy and politics over the next two years. Read more: Koch brothers network aims to raise $300M to $400M for conservative causes That\u2019s a significant jump from the $250 million Koch groups plowed into politics during the 2016 election cycle and does not include the millions more donors that will send to other parts of the Koch operation to fund Charles Koch\u2019s philanthropic work, scholarships and grants to universities to advance his free-market ideas. Donors, who pay $100,000 annually to the network, spent Sunday talking about policy fights, the election ahead and an array of programs the network backs \u2014\u00a0ranging from a project to help former inmates start businesses to the $26 million investment Koch\u2019s foundation and company have made to a non-profit that supports Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In all, 11 elected officials were slated to make appearances at the three-day event. They included three governors, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner and several U.S. senators. All are Republicans. The gathering came as Trump\u2019s order, signed Friday, sparked protests around the country. The executive order suspends entry of all refugees for 120 days, stops admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and bars entry for 90 days to residents from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. On Sunday, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, questioned why the ban, as it was initially drafted, affected green card holders from those countries. But Chaffetz, at the conclave to talk criminal-justice policy with Koch donors, expressed support for Trump\u2019s swift actions in the first days of his presidency. \u201cI support generally what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cHe\u2019s off to a roaring start.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s surprising a lot of people that he is actually doing what he said he was going to do, but there are those of us that actually support that,\u201d he added. Parts of the Koch's three-day summit are open to reporters. But\u00a0organizers impose restrictions, such as\u00a0barring\u00a0journalists from identifying donors at the event without their permission. 8 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jLIpKR NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

(Photo: Bernard Thomas, AP) The American Civil Liberties Union shattered fundraising records this weekend after taking the White House to court over President Trump's executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. The ACLU said it has received roughly 290,000 online donations totaling $19.4 million since Saturday morning. The non-profit organization\u00a0that aims to protect individuals' rights and liberties guaranteed in the Constitution\u00a0typically raises about\u00a0$4 million online in a year, according to Executive Director Anthony Romero. \"It's really clear that this is a different type of moment,\" Romero said. \"People\u00a0want to know what they can do. They want to be deployed as protagonists in this fight. It's not a spectator sport.\" The ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of two men from Iraq who were detained Friday at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after Trump signed his executive order.\u00a0In response to the suit , a\u00a0federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Trump's controversial order \u00a0late Saturday,\u00a0barring officials from deporting those detained in U.S. airports because of the ban.

Its\u00a0membership has doubled since the election.\u00a0\"People understand the threats the Trump administration poses and they are willing to take action to fight those threats,\" Romero said. \"They don't just want to write a\u00a0check and be done with it.\" Nearly 140,000 people signed up for the ACLU's email list since Saturday.\u00a0 Car-service Lyft pledged on Sunday to donate $1 million to the group. Uber went in a different direction. Now\u00a0 #DeleteUber is trending. Singer\u00a0 Sia pledged to donate up to $100,000. So did Rosie O'Donnell.\u00a0 The ACLU saw a 1,900% increase in the number of gifts received this month compared to January 2016. The donations will be used to increase staffing,\u00a0initially by 50 to 100 people this year. The organization has a seven-point plan to take on the Trump administration. Romero said of Trump: \"He has to understand governing is different than running for office.\" The executive order didn't consider\u00a0the \"legal or policy implications, or the practical implications of people traveling to the country.\" He said Trump \"is walking down a very dangerous path. ... He will be met with resistance every step of the way.\" Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Amy B Wang By Amy B Wang January 29 at 3:32 PM Follow @amybwang Former New York mayor Rudy W. Giuliani said President Trump wanted a \"Muslim ban\" and requested he assemble a commission to show him \"the right way to do it legally.\" Giuliani, an early Trump supporter who once had been rumored for a cabinet position in the new administration, appeared on Fox News late Saturday night to describe how Trump's executive order temporarily banning refugees came together. Trump on Friday signed orders not only to\u00a0suspend admission of all refugees into the United States for 120 days but also to implement \u201cnew vetting measures\u201d to screen out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d Refugee entry from Syria, however, would be suspended indefinitely, and all travel from Syria and six other nations \u2014\u00a0Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 are suspended for 90 days.\u00a0Trump also said he would give priority to Christian refugees \u00a0over those of other religions, according to the Christian Broadcasting Network. Fox News host Jeanine Pirro asked Giuliani if the ban had anything to do with religion. \"How did the president decide the seven countries?\" she asked. \"Okay, talk to me.\" \"I'll tell you the whole history of it,\" Giuliani responded eagerly. \"So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.'\" Giuliani continued, saying he assembled a \"whole group of other very expert lawyers on this,\" including former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Tex.) and Rep. Pete King (R-NY). \"And what we did was, we focused on, instead of religion, danger \u2014 the areas of the world that create danger for us,\" Giuliani told Pirro. \"Which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible. And that's what the ban is based on.\u00a0It's not based on religion. It's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.\" It was unclear when the above-mentioned phone call took place and when the commission began working. An email to the White House press office was not immediately returned Sunday. [ Meet the rookie federal judge who halted Trump\u2019s refugee deportations \u2014 to save a Syrian ] Clips of the\u00a0exchange between Giuliani and Pirro quickly went viral Saturday night, with some claiming that Giuliani's statement amounted to admitting Trump's intent had been to institute a ban based on religion. Others, including Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus have insisted it is not a ban on Muslims, but rather one based on countries from which travel was already restricted under the Obama administration. Priebus appeared on CBS's \"Face the Nation \" Sunday morning to say\u00a0it was possible Trump would expand the list of countries included in the travel ban. \"You can point to other countries that have similar problems, like Pakistan and others,\" Priebus told host John Dickerson. \"Perhaps we need to take it further.\" Priebus also said there had been weeks of work and \"plenty of communication\" between the White House, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security regarding the ban. \"We didn't just type this thing up in an office and sign up,\" he told Dickerson. Later on the same program, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) called out Giuliani's interview with Pirro from the night before. \"They can't deny that this is a Muslim ban,\" Ellison told Dickerson. \"On the campaign trail, [Trump] said he wanted a Muslim ban. ... Rudy Giuliani who helped him write it said that they started out with the intention of a Muslim ban and then they sort of 'languaged' it up so to try to avoid that label, but it is a religiously based ban.\" Hundreds of protesters gathered at the arrivals gate of Washington Dulles International Airport to push back against President Trump's executive order that targeted citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. A federal judge in New York blocked deportations nationwide late Saturday of those detained on entry to the United States. (McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) Senate Democrats vowed to draft legislation to block the travel ban. \u201cWe\u2019re demanding the president reverse these executive orders that go against what we are, everything we have always stood for,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a news conference Sunday morning, noting later that his middle name, Ellis, was originally inspired by Ellis Island. \u201cIt was implemented in a way that created chaos and confusion across the country, and it will only serve to embolden and inspire those around the globe those that will do us harm,\" Schumer added. \"It must be reversed immediately.\" Trump's executive order caused mayhem and sparked massive protests at airports around the country Friday and Saturday, as reports surfaced that dozens of travelers from the affected countries, including green-card holders , were being detained. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Saturday morning challenging Trump\u2019s order after two Iraqi men with immigrant visas were barred from entering the United States at John F. Kennedy International Airport. As Giuliani was speaking, Fox News simultaneously aired an alert that noted federal judge Ann M. Donnelly\u00a0had issued a stay to stop the deportations nationwide. Donnelly wrote that there was a strong likelihood the order had violated the petitioners' rights to due process and equal protection by the Constitution. \"There is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017 Executive Order,\" Donnelly wrote . [ Senate Democrats vow legislation to block Trump\u2019s travel ban ] The ACLU hailed the victory. \u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\" ACLU executive director Anthony D. Romero said in a statement.\u00a0\"Our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement saying it did not plan to back off enforcing Trump's orders. \"President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place\u2014prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" the statement read. \"President Trump\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" The department said that less than one percent of daily international air travelers to the United States had been \"inconvenienced\" on Saturday. [ Trump official appears to walk back inclusion of green-card holders in travel ban even as others defend it ] Matthew Kolken, an immigration attorney based in Buffalo said there has been \"a systemic bias against individuals from Muslim countries in the U.S. immigration departments\" for years, including under the Obama administration. \"This isn't unprecedented,\" Kolken told The Washington Post by phone Sunday. \"The unfortunate reality is the executive branch does have vast discretionary authority to determine who they are going [allow in or not].\" That said, Kolken believes \"Trump has gone a step further without a doubt\" in including even people who are lawful permanent residents and suspending all immigration applications from people from the seven countries on the banned list. If there was evidence of disparate treatment of individuals from the same country\u00a0\u2014 if there were anecdotal evidence of, for example, a Syrian family of one religious background allowed to enter over that of another religious background \u2014 then that is where lawsuits could \"come to play,\" he said. \"The question becomes whether they're trying to do an end-around by couching the ban as a country-specific ban based on a security-related issues when in reality it's a religious ban,\" Kolken said.

    "text": "(Abby Phillip, Kelsey Snell) \"I don't want to criticize them for improving vetting,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on ABC's \"This Week.\" He cautioned that the United States doesn't have a religious test for entry into the country, and he stopped short of saying that Trump's action amounted to a Muslim ban. \"I think we need to be careful,\" McConnell said. \"We don't have religious tests in this country.\" The Department of Homeland Security noted that \"less than one percent\" of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \"inconvenienced\" by the executive order - though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country was one of widespread uncertainty and disorder at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained. Federal judges began stepping in late Saturday as requests for stays of Trump's action flooded courtrooms. A federal judge in New York temporarily blocked deportations nationwide. Her ruling was followed by similar decisions by federal judges in California, Virginia, Seattle and Boston. Trump, who centered his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigration and to impose what became known as his \"Muslim ban,'' remained unbowed Sunday. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it. Just after 8 a.m. Sunday, Trump tweeted: \"Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!\" Kelsey Snell, Abby Phillip Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., on Sunday cautioned that the United States does not have a religious test for entry into the country but stopped short of rejecting President Donald Trump 's order to halt the admission of refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. McConnell... Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., on Sunday cautioned that the United States does not have a religious test for entry into the country but stopped short of rejecting President Donald Trump 's order to halt the admission of refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. McConnell... (Kelsey Snell, Abby Phillip) Later in the morning, Trump tweeted, \"Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!\" Many Americans agreed with Trump. \"He doesn't hate Muslims,\" said Kelley Anne Finn of Manassas, Virginia, who was interviewed at Dulles airport Sunday. \"He doesn't hate anybody. He's trying to protect us.\" Administration officials said Sunday that they think it is possible for the White House to both comply with a judge's order and continue enforcing Trump's executive action. Their thinking is that the court order affects only people now in the United States, and that since the State Department is proactively canceling visas of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, other travelers who would be affected by the court order are not expected to be able to travel to the United States in the first place. The officials pointed out that while the order affects deportations, the travelers stranded at U.S. airports are not legally considered to be deported if they go back to their home countries, because they were never technically admitted to the United States. That interpretation of the law will almost certainly lead to more court battles in coming days and could keep overseas travelers detained at airports in a state of legal limbo. As Sunday wore on, it became clear that the answers to those questions would have to wait until another day. The protesters outside the White House pushed on, wielding poster boards with messages such as \"Islamophobia is un-American\" and \"Dissent is patriotic,\" chanting \"No justice! No peace!\" and singing renditions of \"This Land is Your Land.\" And in airports from Baltimore to Bangor, from Dallas to Denver, shouts of \"Let them go!\" and \"Let them in!\" reverberated Sunday. In many cities, demonstrators invoked the same chant: \"No hate, no fear. Refugees are welcome here.\" --- The Washington Post's Philip Bump in New York, Daniel Gross in Boston, and Michael Chandler, Steve Hendrix, Jenna Johnson, Sarah Larimer, Michael Laris, Ellen Nakashima, Ed O'Keefe, Abby Phillip, Kelsey Snell, Elise Viebeck and David Weigel in Washington contributed to this report.

Within 24 hours of Trump signing the executive order, its impact was resonating worldwide as officials struggled to interpret Trump's decision \u2014 leaving refugees and immigrants who had already been vetted and approved to enter the country detained at airports and stuck in legal limbo. People protest President Trump's immigration ban on citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries outside the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29, 2017. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA A dozen people who landed in the U.S. after Trump signed the executive order were detained and some were separated from their families at New York's John F. Kennedy international Airport on Friday, according to lawmakers and attorneys. Two of the detained were Iraqi refugees and one \u2014 identified as Hameed Khalid Darweesh \u2014 was an interpreter working with the U.S. government for a decade, according to his attorneys. Photo gallery: 'Trump Out, Refugees In': Ban Sparks Protests at Airports Across the Nation Darweesh was eventually released Saturday afternoon. The other Iraqi detainee was also released, NBC New York reported. Two people were released from Philadelphia International Airport on Sunday and reunited with their families, according to Mayor Jim Kenney. But there were reports of people detained around the country and lawyers stressed it was hard to know exactly how many people had been detained and where. At least three federal judges in New York, Massachusetts and Virginia have temporarily halted parts of Trump's executive order, blocking the deportation of those coming into the country with valid visas and others who are legally authorized to enter the country. Meanwhile, a senior White House official said Sunday that the president had the right and Constitutional power to enact the order. The judge's decision changed nothing, the official added. News of the detentions brought a mass of protesters to JFK and other airports on Saturday, with more protests kicking off in cities around the country on Sunday. New York City In New York City, thousands of protesters were gathering in Manhattan's Battery park on Sunday afternoon for a march and second day of protests. The New York immigration Coalition's Executive Director Steve Choi told NBC News 12,000 people had signed up for the rally. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio attended the protest. Today at 2pm in Battery Park, I'll stand with thousands of concerned New Yorkers to protest Trump's shameful executive order. \u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) January 29, 2017 I'll be joining New Yorkers at Battery Park this afternoon to stand up for our city's values. See you there. \u2014 Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) January 29, 2017 Gillibrand told the crowd of protesters Trump's executive order \"goes against everything that we as New Yorkers stand for.\" \"Fight for what you believe in, never stop fighting,\" she said. Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, who was a vocal critic of Trump at Saturday's airport protest, addressed the president directly and said \"Mr. President, look around here, this sea of people, this is what America is all about.\" \"Mr. President, we are not going away. We are not backing down \u2014 from our airports, to the courts, to the streets we will continue to fight for justice and freedom, she said to cheers from the crowd. Dallas, Texas Protesters returned to Dallas/Fortworth International Airport on Sunday morning, in a crowd that started off as a few dozen and soon ballooned into hundreds chanting \"Set them free!,\" NBC DFW reported. Looking like it's close to if not into the thousand+ people range here. @NBCDFW pic.twitter.com/xGnslzdHMJ \u2014 Brian Scott (@BrianScottNBC5) January 29, 2017 NBC DFW reported that as of Sunday morning, at least nine people were still being detained at the airport.

All 11 detainees were released by 11 a.m. on Sunday, according to Mayor Kasim Reed. San Francisco, California Droves of protesters were excepted again at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) on Sunday afternoon and at least 50 lawyers were also at the airport offering legal help, NBC Bay Area reported. The airport issued a statement saying they \"appreciate all those who have so passionately expressed their concerns over the President's Executive Order relating to immigration.\" \"We share these concerns deeply, as our highest obligation is to the millions of people from around the world whom we serve,\" the airport said in the statement. SFO said it was making supplies available to affected travelers \"as well as to the members of the public who have so bravely taken a stand against this action by speaking publicly in our facilities.\" Daniella Silva ",

    "text": "YANGON, Myanmar \u2014 A legal adviser for Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy was assassinated at a Myanmar airport Sunday after returning from a trip overseas, the government said. Supreme Court advocate Ko Ni was a longstanding adviser to the country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The Ministry of Information identified the suspect as Kyi Linn from Mandalay. The motive was not known. The gunman allegedly made a close shot to the head as Ko Ni walked out of the arrival gate at Yangon's airport, the Ministry of Information said in a video posted on state-run MRTV. A friend of Ko Ni who witnessed the shooting said the suspected assassin also shot a taxi driver who tried to stop him from fleeing. \"As I stopped my car by the airport, that's where I saw Ko Ni's body lying on the walkway outside of the airport and I couldn't believe that just happened,\" said Thet Paing Soe, a friend and an NLD supporter. \"Then as the shooter tried to run away, the police arrested him.\" Aung San Suu Kyi attends a meeting with Department of Archaeology of Nyaung-U. HEIN HTET / EPA Thet Paing Soe said the taxi driver known as Nay Win stopped the fleeing assassin but was shot. The taxi driver's condition was not clear. Kyee Myint, a former chairman of the Myanmar Lawyer Network who has a close relationship with Ko Ni, also confirmed his death. \"It is a big loss for us that Ko Ni, our beloved friend, has been killed. He is the face of the democracy in our country and this is a big loss for us,\" Kyee Myint added. Ko Ni was a Burmese Muslim and as a practicing lawyer had handled more than 900 criminal cases and more than 1,400 civil cases. In 1995, he established Laurel Law Firm with two other advocates.

It\u2019s out of our hands, the officers said. Their fate was up to their superiors. Passengers were afraid to talk to one another, Moosavizadeh said. No one knew whether they\u2019d be released or sent back to Iran. \u201cMost of them, they thought they were going to get deported,\u201d she said, through her son. At one point, she was taken elsewhere for questioning. Customs officers asked her when she last visited the U.S., who she lives with in Iran and where she gets her income. When she returned, she snacked on almonds she\u2019d packed in her purse. \u201cThank God I put them in my purse, otherwise I didn\u2019t have anything on me,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, in Phoenix, her sons frantically refreshed news articles and peppered her grandson, Siavosh Naji-Talakar, with questions he couldn\u2019t answer. Huddled among\u00a0throngs of boisterous protesters demanding the detainees be released,\u00a0Naji-Talakar could do little but wait.\u00a0 Over and over, they chanted, \u201cLet them in!\u201d They said they\u00a0wouldn\u2019t leave otherwise.\u00a0 Some offered Naji-Talakar food and a couch for the night, others money for a hotel room. Nearby, the detainees heard the cries, faintly. They had no idea, though, if those who had gathered were there to support or decry them. A customs officer, Moosavizadeh said, told the group that it wasn\u2019t safe for them to let them go. Eventually, officers began calling passengers one by one. Detainees were taken away, alone or in pairs, while those left behind wondered if they were being released or deported. \u00a0 \u201cWe all thought they were going to give us hard time first and then send us back,\u201d Moosavizadeh said. She added that she wants Trump to know that Muslims condemn Islamic State. \u201cThey might be Muslim, but they\u2019re not a part of us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all brothers and sisters and we don\u2019t believe in their values \u2014 at all.\u201d Protesters rally against President Trump's new immigration order. Moosavizadeh\u2019s name was among the last ones called, at about 1 a.m.\u00a0 Finally, she said, she was \u201creleased from prison.\u201d When she spotted her grandson in the crowd, she felt like she was flying.\u00a0 He saw her too,\u00a0and bolted. \u201cI pushed people out of the way, I was like, \u2018Get out of my way,\u2019\u201d Naji-Talakar said. \u201cI ran up to her and gave a big old hug.\u201d That\u2019s when the cheering and chanting started again.

Caption Entry to the United States is being refused to legal residents, including green-card holders, from seven mostly Muslim countries who were abroad when the executive order was signed Friday by the president. Jan. 28, 2017 People protest the Muslim immigration ban at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. President Trump signed an executive order that halted refugees and residents from certain predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Trump\u2019s virtually unprecedented executive action applies to migrants, refugees and U.S. legal residents \u2014 green-card holders \u2014 from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen. People subject to being denied entry include dual nationals, who are those born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom. While lawyers are still reviewing a federal court\u2019s temporary stay, administration officials said they believe it is possible for the White House to both comply with the judge\u2019s order and continue enforcing Trump\u2019s executive action. Their thinking is that the judge\u2019s order affects only people now in the United States, and that since the State Department is proactively canceling visas of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, other travelers who would be affected by the judge\u2019s order are not expected to be able to travel to the United States in the first place. The officials pointed out that while the order affects specifically deportations, the travelers currently stranded at U.S. airports are not legally considered to be deported if they go back to their home countries, because they were never technically admitted to the United States. That interpretation of the law will almost certainly lead to more court battles in coming days and could keep overseas travelers detained at airports in a state of legal limbo. Just after 8 a.m. Sunday, Trump tweeted: \u201cOur country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world \u2014 a horrible mess!\u201d Later in the morning, Trump tweeted, \u201cChristians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!\u201d The president\u2019s aggressive action triggered a wave of criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, but also from a growing number of lawmakers in his own party. \u201cYou have an extreme vetting proposal that didn\u2019t get the vetting it should have,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d even as he stopped short of opposing the order outright. Leaders of the influential Koch network on Sunday also expressed opposition to the controversial ban, it is not in keeping with their aims to build a free and open society. \u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d said Brian Hooks, the president of the Charles Koch Foundation. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,\u201d he added. \u201cOur country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies.\u201d But Republican leaders in Congress on Sunday did not join the opposition to Trump\u2019s order. \u201cI don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d He cautioned that the United States doesn\u2019t have a religious test for entry into the country, and stopped short of saying that Trump\u2019s action amounted to a Muslim ban. \u201cI think we need to be careful,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security noted that \u201cless than one percent\u201d of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by the executive order \u2014 though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country Saturday was one of widespread uncertainty and even chaos at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained. Federal judges began stepping in late Saturday as requests for stays of President Trump\u2019s action flooded courtrooms from coast to coast. Late Saturday, a federal judge in New York temporarily blocked deportations nationwide. Her ruling was followed by similar decisions by federal judges in Virginia, Seattle and Boston. In Brooklyn, Judge Ann Donnelly of the U.S. District Court granted a request from the American Civil Liberties Union to stop the deportations after determining that the risk of injury to those detained by being returned to their home countries necessitated the decision. Next came a temporary restraining order by District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, who blocked for seven days the removal of any green-card holders detained at Dulles International Airport. Brinkema\u2019s action also ordered that lawyers have access to those held there because of the ban. In Seattle, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas S. Zilly granted an emergency stay preventing the deportation of two people had been detained at the Sea-Tac International Airport, according to the ACLU of Washington, which joined other advocates in filing an emergency motion. The two people remain in federal custody and will have a hearing later this week, the group said. Just before 2 a.m. Sunday in Boston, two federal judges ruled for two University of Massachusetts Dartmouth associate professors \u2014 Iranian nationals who are permanent legal residents in the United States \u2014 who were held at Logan International Airport when they landed after travel for an academic conference. The judges there also put a seven-day restraining order on Trump\u2019s executive action. It allows any approved refugee, visa holder, or green-card holder to fly into Boston over the next 7 days and requires Customs and Border Protection to notify airlines that fly into Logan Airport that those passengers will not be detained or forced to return. The ruling applies only to Massachusetts. The president\u2019s order also triggered harsh reactions from key sectors of the U.S. business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticized the president. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Lawyers and advocates for immigrants are advising them to seek asylum in Canada. [ The tumultuous politics of U.S. immigration policy, from Roosevelt to Trump ] Yet Trump, who centered his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigrants and impose what became known as his \u201cMuslim ban,\u2019\u2019 was unbowed. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,\u201d Trump told reporters Saturday in the Oval Office. \u201cYou see it at the airports, you see it all over. It\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban, and we\u2019re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\u201d In New York, Donnelly seemed to have little patience for the government\u2019s arguments, which focused heavily on the fact that the two defendants named in the lawsuit had already been released. Donnelly noted that those detained were suffering mostly from the bad fortune of traveling while the ban went into effect. \u201cOur own government presumably approved their entry to the country,\u201d she said at one point, noting that, had it been two days earlier, those detained would have been granted admission without question. During the hearing, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt informed the court that he had received word of a deportation to Syria, scheduled within the hour. That prompted Donnelly to ask if the government could assure that the person would not suffer irreparable harm. Receiving no such assurance, she granted the stay to the broad group included in the ACLU\u2019s request. A senior Department of Homeland Security official said late Saturday that 109 people had been denied entry into the United States. All had been in transit when Trump signed the order, he said, and some had already departed the United States on flights by late Saturday while others were still being detained awaiting flights. Also, 173 people had not been allowed to board U.S.-bound planes at foreign airports. The protests that had begun at airports around the country on Saturday continued on Sunday, with crowds swelling in terminals from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles and places in between. In Washington, protestors flocked to Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport. By early afternoon, a raucous crowd of demonstrators filled Lafayette Square and part of Pennsylvania Avenue. Fencing that remained from the recent inauguration kept them from getting closer to the gates of the White House. Philip Bump in New York, Daniel Gross in Boston, and Michael Chandler, Sarah Larimer, Kelsey Snell and Abby Phillip in Washington contributed to this report. local ",

By Matea Gold and James Hohmann By Matea Gold and James Hohmann January 29 at 3:14 PM Follow @mateagold Follow @JamesHohmann Conservative industrialist Charles Koch declined to back Donald Trump in last year's election. (Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post) INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 Leaders of the influential Koch network on Sunday expressed opposition to President Trump's ban on refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, saying the executive order is not in keeping with their aims to build a free and open society. \u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d said Brian Hooks,\u00a0the president of the Charles Koch Foundation, who is co-chairing a weekend conference of donors who help finance the Koch operation. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,\u201d he added. \u201cOur country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies.\u201d The statement represents the network's first public critique of Trump\u00a0since his election victory. President Trump signed an executive order to halt U.S. entry for refugees, migrants and foreign nationals for 120 days starting Jan. 27. Fiery protests and lawsuits made for a tumultuous weekend. Here's what you need to know. (The Washington Post) Last year, Charles Koch, the conservative industrialist who leads the network, was sharply critical of Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants from the United States, calling the idea \u201cantithetical to our approach.\u201d\u00a0He called\u00a0the suggestion that Trump might require Muslims to register \u201creminiscent of Nazi Germany.\u201d Koch did not weigh in on the ban Saturday night as he greeted 550 wealthy donors gathered in a courtyard under stately palm trees at a desert resort here. The 81-year-old billionaire, who pointedly declined to endorse Trump in last year's presidential election, praised the network's work in helping Republicans maintain their majority in the Senate and their support for state officials around the country. He expressed optimism about what the group will be able to accomplish in the coming year, saying, \u201cWe may not have an opportunity again like we have today.\u201d [ Koch network to spend $300 million to $400 million on politics, policy in 2018 cycle ] In the 2018 cycle, the network aims to spend $300 million to $400 million on policy and political campaigns \u2014 up from $250 million during the 2016 elections. The money will be spread across a constellation of groups, including Americans for Prosperity (AFP), the Freedom Partners Action Fund, Concerned Veterans for America, the Libre Initiative and Generation Opportunity, which operate under the AFP banner. This weekend's gathering is the largest since Koch began holding twice-a-year seminars with like-minded donors in 2003. Since then, he and his allies have built a political and policy operation with reach into 36 states. No one from the Trump administration attended this weekend's conclave. However,\u00a0five Republican senators made appearances: Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.), David Perdue (Ga.), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Mike Lee (Utah) and James Lankford (Okla.). So are two House members, Jason Chaffetz (Utah) and Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.). And three governors flew in: Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker, Arizona\u2019s Doug Ducey and Illinois\u2019s Bruce Rauner. [ Top Republicans raise concerns that ban could harm U.S. image ] Asked by reporters Sunday whether he wanted to weigh in on Trump's refugee ban, Chaffetz quipped: \u201cNot really, but if you want me to, I will.\u201d The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee expressed concerns about the specifics but said the move is generally on the right track. \u201cIf we\u2019re targeting based on religion, I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Chaffetz. \u201cI understand the need and support the idea that vetting from certain countries is needed. \u2026 A legal permanent resident I think is a different category. I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re trying to do on those categories. People that have a green card supposedly have been vetted. So there needs to be some further clarification.\u201d The congressman withdrew his support for Trump in\u00a0October after the revelation of a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video\u00a0in which Trump talked about women in lewd terms. But on Sunday, Chaffetz praised Trump for governing as he campaigned. \u201cI support generally what he\u2019s doing, and he\u2019s off to a roaring start,\u201d said Chaffetz, who might try to run for Senate in 2018. \u201cI think he\u2019s surprising a lot of people that he\u2019s doing what he said he\u2019s going to do. But there are those of us that actually support that.\u201d For his part, Lee ducked when asked\u00a0by reporters about the executive order, saying he only wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, the subject of a panel Sunday morning \u201cWe\u2019re here to discuss a different issue and I\u2019ve got to leave right now to go catch a flight,\u201d he said. Pressed by a group of reporters at the meeting, he added: \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that I\u2019d lose my First Amendment rights after walking out this door.\u201d Then Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, walked out the door. 1 of 29 ",

    "text": "Israel's Netanyahu Says US Embassy Should Be in Jerusalem By aron heller, associated press JERUSALEM \u0097 Jan 29, 2017, 9:58 AM ET 0 Shares Email Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the American embassy in Israel should be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, injecting himself once again into a charged campaign trail promise of U.S. President Donald Trump. Netanyahu's comments at his weekly Cabinet meeting appeared aimed at countering reports that Israel was concerned about the fallout of such a move, which is vehemently opposed by the Palestinians and has sparked fears of a renewed outbreak of violence. It comes a day after Netanyahu unilaterally endorsed Trump's call to build a wall along the Mexican border, saying the Israeli model along its border with Egypt has proven successful \"I would like to clarify unequivocally that our view has always been, and continues to be, that the United States' embassy should be here in Jerusalem,\" Netanyahu said. \"Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and it is appropriate that not only the American embassy will be here but that all embassies will move here and I believe that in due course most will come here, to Jerusalem.\" Currently, nearly all foreign embassies are located in the coastal city of Tel Aviv because their countries have refrained from recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital until its status is resolved in future peace talks. Israel has long called for the embassies to be relocated but hasn't pushed hard for it given the widespread international opposition. But Trump's rise has emboldened Israel's nationalists. His campaign platform made no mention of a Palestinian state, a cornerstone of two decades of international diplomacy in the region, and he has signaled that he will be far more tolerant of Israeli settlement construction than his predecessors. Both his designated ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, now a top aide and Mideast envoy, have deep ties to the settler movement. Friedman and Kushner's family foundation have both been generous contributors to the Beit El settlement, and a delegation of settler representatives was invited to Trump's inauguration. The Palestinians want the West Bank and east Jerusalem \u2014 areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war \u2014 for their hoped-for state. Former President Barack Obama , like the rest of the international community, considered the building of settlements an obstacle to peace and frequently criticized their construction. But Trump did not comment when Israel announced a major housing drive last week. At the Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu also said his government planned to introduce a bill to legalize dozens of West Bank settlement outposts later this week. There are about 100 outposts across the West Bank that Israel considers illegal but tolerates and often allows to flourish. The bill is being pushed by the pro-settler Jewish Home party, which has threatened to quit Netanyahu's coalition if it doesn't go through. The bill was cited as one of the reasons the Obama administration allowed a United Nations Security Council resolution to pass that challenged the legality of the settlements. U.S. officials said that after previously vetoing anti-Israel resolutions, they felt compelled to abstain because of continued Israeli settlement construction and efforts to retroactively legalize dozens of them in exchange for compensation for the original Palestinian landowners. Also Sunday, Israeli troops killed an 18-year-old Palestinian and wounded five others after they came under attack in a refugee camp in the northern West Bank city of Jenin, Israeli and Palestinian officials said. Palestinian police said a group hurled rocks at the Israeli troops, who responded with fire and fatally shot Mohammed Khalefeh. The Israeli military confirmed the account, saying that its forces were attacked with pipe bombs before they responded. Israeli forces routinely carry out arrest raids in the West Bank against wanted Palestinian militants. Since 2015, Palestinian attackers have carried out numerous stabbings, shootings and vehicular assaults that killed 40 Israelis and two visiting Americans. Israeli forces killed 235 Palestinians in the same period, most identified by Israel as attackers. Palestinians and rights groups have accused Israel of using excessive force in some of the confrontations. Israel says the violence is fueled by a Palestinian campaign of incitement compounded on social media sites that glorify and encourage attacks. Palestinians say it stems from frustration over decades of Israeli rule in territory they claim for a state. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Catholic bishop attacked on altar during Mass for baseball Hall of Famer Published               January 29, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print The Most Reverend Manuel A. Cruz, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark. (Archdiocese of Newark) A Catholic bishop in New Jersey was slightly injured during a memorial Mass for a revered Hall of Fame baseball player when a crazed man in a white robe walked up to the altar and punched him in the mouth. The attack Saturday caught the 63-year-old Most Reverend Manuel A. Cruz, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark, completely by surprise, knocking him backward until he fell on the altar, according Tapinto.net , a local news website. Officers with the Essex County Sheriff\u2019s Office rushed the altar and handcuffed the attacker, who may have showed up for the Mass at Newark\u2019s Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in a classic purple Cadillac Eldorado with a faux-zebra skin interior, the website reported. About 75 people witnessed the attack, according to the website reported. The Mass was being held to commemorate the life of baseball great Roberto Clemente, who died in a 1972 plane crash as he flew to Nicaragua to deliver aid to earthquake victims. \u201cWe are all praying for Bishop Cruz,\u201d said Newark elected official Luis Quintana, who organized the Mass and was in tears when he spoke to Tapinto. \u201cIt's hard to understand what would provoke a man to attack a member of the clergy within the sanctity of a church. It just doesn't make any sense.\u201d The punch may have loosened some of Cruz\u2019s teeth, according to the website. Cruz was taken to the hospital for treatment and authorities said his injuries were not serious, the Newark Star-Ledger reported. Officers told the paper the man who was arrested for the assault was Charles Miller, a 48-year-old Newark man. Officials weren\u2019t saying why Miller punched Cruz. \u201cWe are thankful that law enforcement officers were able to apprehend the assailant,\u201d said James Goodness, spokesman for the Newark Archdiocese. \u201cThis is not something that we expect to happen in any of our churches.\u201d Advertisement ",

Samantha Sais / Reuters Share advertisement It's been almost three years since a whistleblower shocked the nation by disclosing that 1,400 of veterans languished without care at the Phoenix, Arizona, Veterans Affairs Hospital \u2014 and new whistleblowers say little has changed except for the harassment they've received. The April 2014 announcement cost then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki his job while members of Congress and President Obama promised that they would do better by the 6 million veterans who use the hospital system. It proved to be an empty promise. Earlier this month, the president's Office of Special Counsel (OSC) reported that thousands of Phoenix veterans went without appointments in the past two years \u2014 and 215 of them ultimately died. Play Trump Announces David Shulkin as Veterans Affairs Secretary 2:01 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170129222412if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/852550723594\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Despite a mandate to see patients within one month, on a daily basis the hospital still has 1,100 people still waiting longer than that, the report found. Now, the whistleblower who alerted the OSC to these alarming numbers tells NBC News that he believes his desire to save veterans' lives came with a price: the VA retaliated against him with harassment, insurmountable work tasks and by placing him under surveillance and investigation for not solving the scheduling problem the VA created. \"As an Iraq veteran, it makes me feel like dirt that bureaucratic civilians who've never served this country are abusing vets like me, and killing vets who have are defenseless because they're ill,\" said Kuauhtemoc Rodriguez, a scheduling manager for the Phoenix VA's specialty care. \"They know the price of freedom and the VA abuses that, and benefits off the backs of veterans.\" Rodriguez's plight to expose the corrupt system even caught the attention of Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, whom respectively, wrote a letter to VA Secretary Bob McDonald demanding answers and issued statements praising the Rodriguez and Coleman. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., speaks to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, right, and Veterans Affairs Undersecretary for Health Robert Petzel on Capitol Hill on May 15, 2014, during a hearing to examine the state of Veterans Affairs health care. Cliff Owen / AP file Rodriguez said he sought the protection of the OSC after several things happened: His complaint to the Inspector General's office was somehow emailed to several staff members by his boss, his computer was monitored, he was placed under surveillance, and he was criticized for not fixing scheduling problems by himself. \"They grilled me for four hours in a [VA investigatory] board. I was in the military and had to deal with the CIA once and that only took me an hour,\" Rodriguez told NBC News. \"I've been in combat in Iraq and to have to come home and deal with this?\" asked Rodriguez. Phoenix VA spokesman Paul Coupaud denied that Rodriguez was being retaliated against for whistleblowing, but said the actions were taking because the VA's Administrative Investigation Board (AIB) was \"investigating allegations of harassment.\" Coupaud said the Phoenix VA's director received multiple complaints of harassment against the health services leadership team, which included Rodriguez. \"In the VA, an AIB is an impartial inquiry to determine facts, collect evidence, reveal improvement areas, and identify system problems,\" Coupaud said. \"Generally, an AIB does not make recommendations for action to senior leaders, but only reports facts found during the investigation ... As the investigation is not complete, we cannot address what facts the AIB has or has not discovered.\" The VA also disputed the number of veteran deaths saying the number was actually 118 \u2014 and that only one person could be verified as a definite result of unscheduled care. \u201cThey grilled me for four hours in a [VA investigatory] board. I was in the military and had to deal with the CIA once and that only took me an hour\u201d Rodriguez said he first discovered that something was wrong in April 2015, when he was going through a list of veterans unscheduled for care and found six dead patients. Concerned, he did further research and found more than 200 dead patients \u2014 all who had died waiting for procedures like dialysis, colonoscopies, lump removals, vascular surgeries and mental health screenings. Thousands more patients awaited appointments, he said. He brought the findings to his supervisors but decided to complain to the Inspector General when \"there was no real movement to get to the bottom why we weren't scheduling people on time.\" The VA would have needed to hire an additional 38 people to manage the scheduling, but no move was done to do this, he said.

Leaders React to Trump's Order Several Republicans spoke out on Sunday in response to President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on immigration from seven countries. Senator John McCain said he feared it would provide propaganda for the Islamic State. By ELSA BUTLER on Publish Date January 29, 2017. Photo by Al Drago/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 A growing group of Republican lawmakers criticized President Trump\u2019s refugee policy on Sunday even as party leaders in Congress continued to show restraint. The executive order Mr. Trump issued on Friday, which targets Syrian refugees and all travelers from several predominantly Muslim nations, had drawn little dissent from Republicans initially even as Democrats denounced it and protests erupted around the country and the world. But on Sunday, several members of Mr. Trump\u2019s party said that the process, while initiated with the right intention, had been too hastily enacted and warned that it could backfire against United States interests. Two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, led the criticism, saying in a statement that Mr. Trump\u2019s order was not properly vetted and that it could be seen as the United States turning its back on Muslims who had risked their lives to serve as interpreters for the country\u2019s military and diplomats. \u201cUltimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,\u201d they said, adding, \u201cThat is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. McCain also said the plan was carried out without proper consultation of United States allies and that it mistakenly lumped together the country\u2019s adversaries, like Iran, with allies, like Iraq. Republicans have largely supported Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive agenda, but in his first major decision on national security, he is finding uncharacteristic opposition from his party in the blush of his early days in office. Mr. Trump did not take well to the input, singling out Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter as \u201csadly weak on immigration.\u201d The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two... \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 29, 2017 ...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 29, 2017 But as they day went on, they were not alone in their criticisms. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that while he supported stronger screening, the order had been \u201cpoorly implemented,\u201d especially for green card holders. \u201cThe administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated,\u201d Mr. Corker said. Indeed, the administration moved to ease some of those concerns late Sunday, when the Department of Homeland Security announced that lawful permanent residents would be exempt from the ban. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, likewise said the order was \u201coverly broad\u201d and that the blanket travel ban \u201cgoes to far.\u201d Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee seemed to echo those criticisms, adding that \u201cwhile not explicitly a religious test, it comes close to one, which is inconsistent with our American character.\u201d Senator Rob Portman , Republican of Ohio, went further, questioning the hastiness of the order\u2019s rollout and calling for a re-evaluation of the White House\u2019s unilateral effort. \u201cIn my view, we ought to all take a deep breath and come up with something that makes sense for our national security and again for this notion that America has always been a welcoming home for refugees and immigrants,\u201d Mr. Portman said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Similar concerns were voiced by some Republicans in the House. Most prominent among them was Representative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, who said that \u201cit was clear\u201d that adjustments were needed to the order, but defended it in principle. Representative Will Hurd of Texas, a former undercover C.I.A. officer, called the measure \u201cthe ultimate display of mistrust\u201d that would \u201cerode our allies\u2019 willingness to fight with us\u201d and put Americans at risk. Advertisement A handful of other Republicans, including Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, also offered criticism, though more cautious, on Saturday.

You are already subscribed to this email. Privacy Policy The Republican leadership \u2014 and senior members of the House \u2014 have either supported Mr. Trump or been largely silent about the order. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said that the United States did not make policy based on religion, though his criticism was muted compared with his colleagues\u2019. Speaker Paul D. Ryan released a statement on Friday praising the order, but his aides repeatedly declined requests for further comment. Mr. McConnell cautioned against vilifying Muslims who are key allies in the American war on terror. The country, he said, needed to \u201cbe careful\u201d with how the order is carried out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to criticize them for improving vetting,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI think we need to be careful. We don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201d As tensions mount, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions will be debated on Capitol Hill this week. Democrats pledged on Sunday to introduce legislation undoing them and limiting Mr. Trump\u2019s executive authority. And the measure could add pressure to Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to lead the Justice and State Departments, who will probably be asked to offer their positions on the ban. Some Republicans compared the order to a measure that overwhelmingly passed the House in 2015 not long after the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris . But that bill was far less broad than Mr. Trump\u2019s order, focusing narrowly on the screening process for Syrians and Iraqis who entered the United States as refugees. That bill was blocked by Democrats in the Senate , who argued that it too closely mirrored Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign talk of a Muslim ban, and congressional Republicans largely put off the issue during the rest of the campaign. Mr. Trump\u2019s order, which was enacted on Friday, halted the entry into the United States of all refugees for 120 days, barred the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspended for 90 days the entry of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 all predominantly Muslim countries. It prompted chaos across the globe as the United States\u2019 borders were sealed off to the affected groups and the Department of Homeland Security rushed to apply uneven enforcement. By Saturday night, judges in at least two states had issued stays preventing the government from deporting certain arrivals caught in the rollout of the order. Democrats were nearly united in their condemnation of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy, with several of them rushing to airports to speak out in defense of people who had been detained and even those representing states that Mr. Trump won voicing dissent. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. Trump to immediately reverse the action on Sunday, saying it made the country \u201cless humanitarian, less safe, less American.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt must be reversed immediately, and Democrats are going to introduce legislation to overturn it,\u201d Mr. Schumer told reporters gathered for a news conference in New York. Republicans who spoke out were more measured, directing their criticism at the planning for the policy and its carrying out, though their disagreement with Mr. Trump was still clear. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, wrote on the website Medium that the president \u201cand his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it\u2019s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry.\u201d Mr. Sasse said Mr. Trump was right to focus on border security but disagreed with how he was carrying out the policy. And Representative Barbara Comstock, a Republican whose Northern Virginia district includes a large Muslim population, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s action had gone \u201cbeyond the increased vetting actions the Congress has supported.\u201d Jennifer Steinhauer and Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.

President Trump speaks on the phone with Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 28, 2017. (Pete Marovich / EPA) Tribune news services Contact Reporter To build his highly touted deportation force, President Donald Trump is reviving a long-standing program that deputizes local officers to enforce federal immigration law. The program received scant attention during a week in which Trump announced plans to build a border wall, hire thousands more federal agents and impose restrictions on refugees from Middle Eastern countries. But the program could end up having a significant impact on immigration enforcement around the country, despite falling out of favor in recent years amid complaints that it promotes racial profiling. More than 60 police and sheriff's agencies had the special authority as of 2009, applying for it as the nation's immigration debate was heating up. Since then, the number has been halved and the effort scaled back as federal agents ramped up other enforcement programs and amid complaints officers weren't focusing on the goal of catching violent offenders and instead arrested immigrants for minor violations, like driving with broken tail lights. Sheriff Joe Arpaio used the program most aggressively in metro Phoenix, and he became arguably the nation's best-known immigration enforcer at the local level in large part because of the special authority. In a strange twist, he was thrown out of office in the same election that vaulted Trump to the presidency, mostly because of mounting frustration over legal issues and costs stemming from the patrols. President Donald Trump's sweeping executive order to suspend refugee arrivals and impose tough controls on travellers from seven countries was met with protests at U.S. airports.\u00a0 In his executive order this week, Trump said he wants to empower local law enforcement to act as immigration officers and help with the \"investigation, apprehension, or detention\" of immigrants in the country illegally. The move comes at a time when the country is sharply divided over the treatment of immigrants. Cities such as Chicago and San Francisco have opposed police involvement in immigration while some counties in Massachusetts and Texas are now seeking to jump in. Proponents say police departments can help bolster immigration enforcement and prevent criminals from being released back into their neighborhoods, while critics argue that deputizing local officers will lead to racial profiling and erode community trust in police. Cecillia Wang, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney, said police bosses who want to get into immigration enforcement should consider what happened when 100 of Arpaio's deputies were given the federal arrest power. The longtime sheriff used the authority to carry out traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. The patrols were later discredited in a lawsuit in which a federal judge concluded Arpaio's officers had racially profiled Latinos. The lawsuit so far cost county taxpayers $50 million. ",

Barbara Comstock, R-Va., meets supporters at a campaign event Oct. 22, 2016, in Winchester, Va. (Photo: Jeff Taylor, AP) Faced with a cascade of protests across the country against President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on refugees from predominantly Muslim countries, some Republicans suggested the order may have been too broad and hastily written. But the top Senate Republican, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, avoided directly criticizing Trump and said the courts would have to decide the legality of the president\u2019s actions. McConnell said Sunday he supports enhanced vetting of refugees, but said the courts would have to look at the order to see if it is too broad. \"We need to bear in mind that we don\u2019t have religious tests in this country and we also need to remember that some of our best allies in the war against Islamic terrorism are Muslims,\"McConnell said on ABC's This Week. \"It's hopefully going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far. I don't what to criticize them for improving vetting. I think we need to be careful. We don't have religious tests in this country.\" Also critical was Sen, Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"We all share a desire to protect the American people, but this executive order has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders,\" Corker said. \"The administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated.\" Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Sunday \"In light of the confusion and uncertainty created in the wake of the President\u2019s Executive Order, it is clear adjustments are needed.\" McCaul said it is important to have tougher screening measures to prevent terrorists from sneaking in as refugees, but he added, \"In the future, such policy changes should be better coordinated with the agencies implementing them and with Congress to ensure we get it right\u2014and don\u2019t undermine our nation\u2019s credibility while trying to restore it.\u201d At a Saturday town hall meeting with constituents, Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on immigration and border security,\u00a0said\u00a0that people with green cards who are from countries affected by the president's order should not be allowed into the United States. But he later said he had misspoken. \"After a town hall meeting, I was pressed to answer questions about whether the President's immigration pause should apply to green card holders.\u00a0 I do not believe it is right to ban green card holders from entering the United States absent evidence of a threat, regardless of where they are from. I misspoke and I apologize for the confusion.\" Other Republicans said Trump's order went too far. Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the execution or the order and said it would probably provide a propaganda advantage to ISIS, the terrorist network. Read more: Protests against Trump's immigration plan rolling in more than 30 cities Rep. Barbara Comstock, a Republican\u00a0from the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., said that while she supports increased vetting for national security concerns, Trump's order\u00a0\u201cwent beyond the increased vetting actions that Congress has supported on a bipartisan basis and inexplicably applied to green card holders, people who are legally within our country who have followed the rules . . .\u00a0this should be addressed and corrected expeditiously.\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said on CNN\u00a0Sunday that the order was \u201cnot properly vetted\u201d and should be stayed until Congress can get involved. \u201cYou have an extreme vetting proposal that didn\u2019t get the vetting it should have had, and as a result, in the implementation\u00a0we\u2019ve seen some problems,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cI think we should slow down.\u201d Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,\u00a0said \u201cI strongly urge the new administration to move quickly to tailor its policy on visa issuance as narrowly as possible, delivering on our security needs while reducing unnecessary burdens on the vast majority of visa-seekers that present a promise \u2014 not a threat \u2014 to our nation.\u201d Hatch noted that Mormons were also once a persecuted religious minority, and his ancestors were \"refugees\" who were \"driven from their homes.\" Hatch is the most senior Republican in the U.S. Senate and is considering running for an eighth term in 2018. Trump carried Utah with just under 46% of the vote, as 20% voted for GOP candidate Evan McMullin, a Mormon who ran as an alternative to Trump. Read more: The first 100 days of the Trump presidency Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from central Pennsylvania, was more blunt. \"This is ridiculous,\" he told The Washington Post. \"I guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration.\" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said \u201cthe worldwide refugee ban set forth in the executive order is overly broad and implementing it will be immediately problematic.\" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., indicated on Twitter that Trump's order should be reconsidered. We should value freedom & not surrender security. We can protect the homeland while upholding #religiousfreedom & refuge for the persecuted. \u2014 Sen. James Lankford (@SenatorLankford) January 29, 2017 In a later statement, Lankford said the order\u00a0\"is not a ban on Muslims or a permanent change in immigration policy.\" But he added, \"This executive action has some unintended consequences that were not well thought out. I encourage the president's staff to evaluate American policy with an eye on both security and compassion for the refugees fleeing the terrors of war and persecution.\" Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, strongly supported the intent of Trump's order, saying \"President Trump has finally taken necessary national security and public safety measures regarding refugees and non-immigrants seeking entry. The media\u2019s mischaracterization of the order as a \u2018ban on Muslims\u2019 is not only false, it is intentionally designed to mislead the public and to undermine the President's agenda.\" But he added, \u201cThe Administration, however, could have done a better job of implementing this executive order. They failed to provide clear guidance on the policy which caused substantial confusion at the ports of entry. I urge the Administration to revisit the order's applicability to legal permanent residents of the United States, and exercise great care before taking future action.\" Posted!

The move was quickly panned by world leaders and by elected officials in the U.S., including several from within Mr. Trump\u2019s own party. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus says it is possible for President Trump's immigration ban to be expanded to \"other countries that have ... In his statement, Mr. Trump stressed that the ban is only temporary and noted that it doesn\u2019t apply to all Muslim-majority countries. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday morning that the Trump administration may expand the number of countries included on the list. \u201cThere are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.\u201d He cited past precedent on the issue, saying the Obama administration implemented a pause on refugee arrivals back in 2011. \u201cMy policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months,\u201d he said. \u201cThe seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.\u201d Mr. Trump said he has \u201ctremendous feeling\u201d for Syrian refugees, but that national security must come first. \u201cAmerica is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica has always been the land of the free and home of the brave.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the White House, said that nothing in the judge\u2019s order \u201cin anyway impedes or prevents the implementation of the president\u2019s executive order which remains in full, complete and total effect.\u201d Judge Ann Donnelly made the ruling a day after Mr. Trump signed\u00a0 the executive order \u00a0that changed American immigration and refugee policies. The order banned people from seven countries with Muslim majorities -- Syria, Iraq, Libya, Iran, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen -- from entering the U.S. It also placed a temporary hold on any refugees entering the U.S. for 120 days, until officials decide on a new screening process, and placed an indefinite hold on the entry of Syrian refugees fleeing war in their country. Senior administration officials told CBS News that\u00a0 green card holders \u00a0from the seven listed countries would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if they can enter the U.S. But on Sunday, Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, assured NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that green card holders will not be affected by the executive order. Later, however, he said \u201cfurther screening\u201d will be applied to green card holders. Providing some insight into further White House directives on travel, Priebus warned, that U.S. citizens who frequently traveled to and from the affected countries could also be subjected to more questioning. The ban barring citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations entry into the U.S. has\u00a0 sparked protests \u00a0around the country Saturday night and Sunday. \u00a0 Mr. Trump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from coming to the U.S. ",

    "text": "Trump Gives Controversial Adviser Bannon Seat at Security Council Principals Meetings By Alexander Mallin Jan 29, 2017, 4:06 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump's Frenzied First Week in Office 0 Shares Email President Donald Trump has tapped his controversial senior adviser and chief strategist Stephen Bannon for a seat at National Security Council Principals Committee meetings in what some experts are calling an \"unprecedented\" political appointment to the panel. In an executive memorandum signed by Trump on Saturday, the president also downgraded the status of the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the security council's Principals Committee. Both will now only attend meetings \"where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.\" The invitation-only status of the Joint Chiefs chairman and director of national intelligence is similar to a policy instituted under President George W. Bush. Another Bush-era policy re-instituted in Trump's memorandum is separating the Homeland Security Council from the NSC, which President Obama had previously merged. While it's not abnormal for presidents to restructure the makeup of their National Security Council , the addition of Bannon, the former publisher of Breitbart News , to the Principals Committee has brought scrutiny over the adviser's influence in Trump's inner circle. Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice , who worked with Trump's National Security Adviser Michael Flynn during the transition, called Trump's reorganization \"stone cold crazy.\" This is stone cold crazy. After a week of crazy. Who needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK? https://t.co/Mmyc139w3M \u2014 Susan Rice (@AmbassadorRice) January 29, 2017 Responding to questions around the reorganization on ABC's 'This Week,' White House press secretary Sean Spicer called Rice's tweets \"clearly inappropriate.\" \"We are instilling reforms to make sure that we streamline the process for the president to make decisions on key, important intelligence matters,\" Spicer said. \"What they have done is modernize the National Security Council so that it is less bureaucratic and more focused on providing the president with the intelligence he needs.\" Some have also pointed to comments by Joshua Bolten, the former chief of staff to Bush,and how he recalled the former president specifically demanding that adviser Karl Rove not attend meetings where national security issues were discussed. \"It wasn't because he didn't respect Karl's advice or didn't value his input,\" Bolten said at a national security forum last September. \"But the president also knew that the signal he wanted to send to the rest of his administration, the signal he wanted to send to the public, and the signal he especially wanted to send to the military is that the decisions I'm making that involve life and death for the people in uniform will not be tainted by any political decisions.\" Spicer cited Bannon's previous experience as a Naval officer as evidence his opinion would be valuable in the NSC, but added \"he's not giving advice.\" \"He's got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now,\" Spicer said. \"Having key decision makers, and the chief strategist for the United States -- for the president to come in and talk about what the strategy is going forward is crucial.\" ",

    "text": "By Aaron Blake By Aaron Blake January 29 at 9:13 PM Follow @aaronblake Trump administration officials defended the president's executive order temporarily banning entry to the U.S. from seven mostly Muslim countries, but lawmakers from both parties expressed strong concern or objection. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) President Trump's executive order to ban entry to the United States to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries has been roundly criticized by the international community and Democrats , who allege it amounts to a religious test -- even a thinly veiled \"Muslim ban.\" There have also been numerous implementation headaches, with\u00a0 two judges halting deportations of those denied entry . And some Republicans are speaking out against Trump, too -- albeit to varying degrees. Below, we break down who has gone on the record for, against or somewhat in the middle on Trump's executive order. This list is necessarily incomplete, but it will be constantly updated as more lawmakers weigh in. If you see one we've missed, email me here . Opposed (16) Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.): \u201cIt is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. Such a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.\" (Joint statement with Sen. Lindsey Graham) Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): See above. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.):\u00a0\u201c It\u2019s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry.\" Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.): The order is \" too broad .\" \"If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion. Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.):\u00a0\u201c This is ridiculous . I guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration. You know, there are many, many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for many innocent, vulnerable people around the world.\u201d Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.): \"Like Pres. Obama's executive actions on immigration, Pres. Trump's executive order overreaches and undermines our constitutional system.\" Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.):\u00a0\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order [goes] beyond the increased vetting actions that Congress has supported on a bipartisan basis and inexplicably applied to Green Card holders. This should be addressed and corrected expeditiously.\u201d Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.): \" The president's policy entirely misses the mark .\" Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.):\u00a0\u201cWhile I\u2019ve supported heightened vetting procedures for those wanting to travel to our country, I have never, nor will I ever support a blanket travel ban for people solely based on ethnic or religious grounds.\u201d Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.):\u00a0\u201c I object to the suspension of visas from the seven named countries because we could have accomplished our objective of keeping our homeland safe by immediate implementation of more thorough screening procedures.\" Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.): \"Our first role as the federal government is to protect our national security and I believe we need to work in Congress to reform and strengthen our visa vetting process. However, I oppose President Trump's rushed and overly broad Executive Order .\" Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.): \"While I am supportive of strengthening our screening processes and securing our borders, a blanket travel ban goes too far. I also believe that lawful residents of the United States should be permitted to enter the country. I urge the Administration to take the appropriate steps to fix this overly broad executive order.\u201d Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.): The ban is the \" ultimate display of mistrust \" and \"will erode allies' willingness to fight with us.\" Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.): \"...While I do support increased vetting of individuals applying to travel from countries with extensive terrorist ties or activity, the President\u2019s current travel ban executive order appears rushed and poorly implemented .\" Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio):\u00a0\u201cWhile I agree with the President that we must improve our visa vetting process in order to better protect Americans, I believe the executive order risks violating our nation\u2019s values and fails to differentiate mainstream Islamic partners from radical Islamic terrorists -- setting back our fight against radical Islam. I urge the Administration to quickly replace this temporary order with permanent improvements in the visa vetting process.\u201d Reservations/decline to fully support (20) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.):\u00a0\" It\u2019s going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far.\" Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah): \"I do have some technical questions about President Trump's Executive Order titled 'Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.'\u00a0 My staff and I will continue to reach out to the White House for clarification on these issues.\" House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.): \"Pausing the intake of refugees from terror hot spots is the right call to keep America safe . I hope cases of individuals with visas traveling as this executive action went into effect \u2014 including some who served alongside U.S. troops \u2014 will be resolved quickly.\u201d Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah):\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump has described his recent order as a means \u2018[to] temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies.\u2019 In this spirit, I urge the new administration to move quickly to tailor its policy on visa issuance as narrowly as possible so that officials can protect our security needs while reducing unnecessary burdens on the vast majority of visa-seekers that present a promise\u2014not a threat\u2014to our nation.\" Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.): \"The United States is and has always been a generous nation when it comes to welcoming those who seek refuge and want to contribute. I expect that these executive orders are in fact temporary and that after the Administration strengthens the vetting process, we can continue our tradition of welcoming those who are persecuted in an orderly manner and without any kind of religious test.\" Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): \"It is not a ban. However, I think it was not properly vetted . So, you have an extreme vetting proposal that didn't get the vetting it should have had. And as the result, in the implementation, we've seen some problems.\" Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.): \u201cI support the temporary entry restriction from certain nations until the administration, Congress and the American people know with confidence that any individual being granted admission does not pose a threat to our security. ... With all that being said, I will be closely monitoring the execution of this EO to make sure that any misapplication is corrected immediately.\u201d Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.):\u00a0\"This executive action has some unintended consequences that were not well thought out. I encourage the president's staff to evaluate American policy with an eye on both security and compassion for the refugees fleeing the terrors of war and persecution.\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.): \"I support a comprehensive look at our vetting process, and I believe it\u2019s something every new administration would be expected to do. However, reports of green card holders and those who assisted us in the war on terror being denied or delayed entry is deeply concerning. Such detention is unacceptable and must be remedied immediately.\" Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine): \"The congressman will not be voting on these Executive Orders. \u00a0His policy in Congress has been to increase border security, end sanctuary cities and stop Syrian refugee admissions until national security agencies put in place effective processes to ensure that no suspected or potential terrorists are allowed to cross our borders.\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.): \"The language of the order should not apply to legal permanent residents of the United States, and if it is being enforced \u00a0in any other way, the administration should step in swiftly to clarify.\u201d Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.): \"America has long needed to tighten the vetting process for those seeking to come here. However, a religious test or ban is against everything our country stands for. We need to remember that some of our best sources of information that keeps our nation and our troops safe comes from our Muslim friends and allies.\" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah): \"I think it\u2019s surprising a lot of people that he is actually doing what he said he was going to do, but there are those of us that actually support that. ... People that have a green card supposedly already have been vetted, so there needs to be some further clarification.\" Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio): \"While I strongly encourage the Administration to examine more closely whether it is effectual and necessary to subject green card holders from these nations to this temporary order, I fully support our government's renewed commitment to keeping Americans of all faiths safe and free across our homeland.\" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.): \"This vetting proposal itself needed more vetting. More scrutiny of those traveling from war-torn countries to the United States is wise. But this broad and confusing order seems to ban legal, permanent residents with \u2018green cards,\u2019 and might turn away Iraqis, for example, who were translators and helped save lives of Americans troops and who could be killed if they stay in Iraq. And while not explicitly a religious test, it comes close to one which is inconsistent with our American character.\u201d Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.): \"We all share a desire to protect the American people, but this executive order has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders. The administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated.\u201d Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho): Trump has the authority but \" inadequate review and poor implementation .\" Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.): \"I do not believe in discrimination, I do not support a religious test for immigrants or refugees, and I do support our nation's refugee resettlement program. America is a nation of immigrants, and our diversity has always been one of our greatest strengths. I join my colleagues in Congress in calling on the Administration for more information and clarity around the impact of the temporary provisions in the executive order on people who already have visas or who have previously been granted legal status.\u201d Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.): \"I believe the President's intent was to accomplish that goal. However, I have concerns with this executive order, including the fact that it could potentially deny entrance to our country to lawful, permanent residents and dual citizens.\" Support (39) House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.):\u00a0\" President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.): \"With the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last Administration did in eight years.\u201d Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.):\u00a0\u201cI commend President Trump for suspending the refugee program, and in particular for Syria and the six other countries, because they are unquestionably terrorist havens and hotspots.\" Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.): \"I'm grateful that @realDonaldTrump is making the safety & security of the American people his top priority. His actions are very appropriate .\" Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.): \" It's very prudent to say, 'Let's be careful about who comes into our country to make sure that they're not terrorists.'\" Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.): \"President Trump's decision is in America's best interest, and I support exploring safe zones in the region to protect innocent life.\" Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.):\u00a0\u201cThe primary duty of the federal government is to keep Americans safe. Today, President Trump has begun to fulfill this responsibility by taking a number of critical steps within his authority to strengthen national security and the integrity of our nation\u2019s immigration system.\" Rep. Dave Trott (R-Mich.): \"Until we can adequately vet these refugees and ensure the safety of all Americans, I support President Trump's executive order to stay refugees from these terror-prone countries.\" Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.):\u00a0\u201cMy first and most important job is protecting families in our region and the American people \u2026 We must be absolutely certain we have systems in place capable of thoroughly vetting anyone applying for refugee status on American soil.\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.):\u00a0\u201cIt's simply wrong to call the president\u2019s executive order concerning immigration and refugees \u2018a religious test\u2019 of any kind. I doubt many Arkansans or Americans more broadly object to taking a harder look at foreigners coming into our country from war-torn nations with known terror networks; I think they\u2019re wondering why we don\u2019t do that already.\" Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): \"He is doing what he told the American people he would do. I would not support a travel ban on Muslims; I do support increased vetting on people applying to travel from countries with extensive terrorist ties or activity. These seven countries meet that standard. Our top priority should be to keep Americans safe.\" Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.): \"I appreciate President Trump's efforts to address these issues as he works to keep the American people safe. While there have been some issues with the order's implementation, I look forward to working with the Trump Administration to make sure their efforts to protect the American people succeed in a timely and effective manner.\" Rep. Scott Taylor (R-Va.): \"While I do not agree with some of the rhetoric, taking a pause, figuring out if we are properly vetting people, and making changes if necessary to continue our American principles is prudent and needed. The safety and protection of our citizens must remain our number one priority.\" Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.): \" LONG OVERDUE : A freeze on Syrian refugees and a crackdown on sanctuary cities! Time to protect Americans.\" Rep. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.): \" This is long overdue . We must ensure our country is safe from radical Islamic jihadists who want to kill Americans.\" Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.): \" I applaud President Trump's actions to vamp up the vetting of refugees attempting to enter our country. Rep. Brian Babin (R-Tex.): \" Great news -- now let's get it into law!\" Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio): \" I support President Trump\u2019s temporary, three month, precautionary action directed towards a handful of countries with a history of producing and exporting terrorists.\u00a0 These countries are either torn apart by violence, or under the control of hostile, jihadist governments.\" Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.): \"The temporary suspension of the refugee program and admission of individuals from countries where terrorism poses an elevated threat will allow our national security officials to examine the vetting process and strengthen safeguards to prevent terrorists from entering our homeland. I hope the administration provides greater clarity in the coming days on its implementation of the order and its review of vetting procedures.\" Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.): \u201cPresident Trump is ensuring that he is doing all he can to protect us from radical Islamic terror, and to secure channels of migration in the future. Though we would like to see a more specific definition worked through Congress, we understand the need for quick action, and we stand by him in this effort.\u201d Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.): \"This is a pause, not a ban, while we work to ensure the U.S. has effective vetting processes in place to protect Americans from terrorist threats. The details will of course matter, but it's way past time for us to develop this capability, and President Trump is right to prioritize American safety until we get this done.\" Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.): \"At a time of grave security threats, President Trump is right to pause the flow of refugees from countries where terrorism is rampant until we can properly vet them and implement additional screening for individuals traveling to and from these countries.\" Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.): \"Just as President Obama suspended the refugee program in 2011 for six months, the Trump Administration is working to protect national security by making adjustments in the refugee vetting process. It is critical that we address the threat of individuals who come to our country to create chaos and threaten our freedom.\u201d Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.): \"This is not a ban on Muslim refugees, as the order specifically targets a select few nations with known terrorist networks and is similar to an executive order signed by President Obama without controversy in 2011. The President and his administration must now focus on the execution of this order, ensuring that it is implemented effectively and fairly.\" Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Tex.): \"It is important that our commander in chief puts the safety of Americans first. Given concerns about the inadequate vetting of refugees and problems with our immigration system, this temporary pause is intended to ensure the safety of our citizens.\" Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.): \"In light of attempts by jihadist groups to infiltrate fighters into refugee flows to the West, along with Europe\u2019s tragic experience coping with this problem, the Trump Administration\u2019s executive order on refugees is a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland. While accommodations should be made for green card holders and those who\u2019ve assisted the U.S. armed forces, this is a useful temporary measure on seven nations of concern until we can verify who is entering the United States.\u201d Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa): \"...\u00a0The bottom line is they can\u2019t properly vet people coming from war-torn areas like Syria and Iraq. If we can\u2019t vet people properly, then we shouldn\u2019t be allowing them into our country. I\u2019m supportive of that .\u201d Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.): \"We have heard of brief delays among constituents and are empathetic to any inconveniences while traveling .\" Rep. Roger Williams (R-Tex.): \"President Trump is responsible for defending this country, and I think what we've seen in the last couple days with executive orders that he's passed, that's what he's doing .\" Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.): \u201cQuite frankly, I think it is commonsense for additional vetting to occur for the countries that are home to ISIS and AL Qaeda. The fact that some in DC are lost in the political correctness of this, is not that surprising. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.): \"We are at war with Islamic extremists and anything less than 100 percent verification of these refugees\u2019 backgrounds puts our national security at risk. We need to take the time to examine our existing programs to ensure terrorists aren't entering our country. The safety of U.S. citizens must be our number one priority.\u201d Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.):\u00a0\u201cI think what Donald Trump is doing is he\u2019s pulling America\u2019s head out of the sand and facing the reality that we have not been kept very safe by current immigration and refugee policies.\u201d Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Tex.): \"As he has made clear, President\u00a0 Trump is taking the steps well within his authority, and based off intelligence gathered in the Obama Administration, to keep our country safe. Congress should remain involved in the process and provide legislation to strengthen not only border security but vetting those who wish to enter the country through any means.\" Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.): \" This temporary halt will give Congress and the new Administration time to evaluate and improve the vetting process, and in the meantime gives Secretary Kelly authority to grant exceptions to the restrictions as needed. One of those exceptions must be to green card holders, who have already undergone extensive screening.\" Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.): \"President Trump is fulfilling a campaign promise to re-evaluate our visa vetting process so that the American people are safe from terrorism.\" Rep. David Kustoff (R-Tenn.): \"I believe President Trump is putting American safety first, and I will encourage a long-term plan that is consistent with the values and compassion on which our great nation was founded.\" Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.):\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t think the Constitution applies to people coming in from outside the country , especially if there is a logical basis for it.\" Unclear (7) Rep. Kay Granger (R-Tex.): \" I am convinced that resident Trump made this decision because he believes it will make us safer.\" Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.): \"While we should be responsive to those who are persecuted for their faith or impacted by war, we need a thorough vetting of all refugees, consistent with the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act (H.R. 4038), which I co-sponsored and helped pass with strong bipartisan support in 2015. This bipartisan legislation required the FBI, CIA, and Homeland Security to be engaged in the refugee vetting process to prevent access by infiltrated terrorists.\" Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa): \"The goals of the Executive Order are commendable, and something President Trump promised during the campaign, but implementation will be key to ensuring the bad guys are kept out while remaining a welcoming nation to people of all backgrounds and religions.\" Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla): \"The purpose\u00a0 of this ban is to have time to put\u00a0 procedures and processes in place to gain control over our borders and assure the American people that we know who is coming in, why and what they will do here. We should demand no less than these basic safeguards from our government. Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.):\u00a0\" I look forward to carefully analyzing this temporary executive order and its effects, and working with this new administration and my colleagues in Congress to keep America safe\u00a0while\u00a0finally ending the unspeakable suffering of the Syrian people.\" Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.): \"I interpret these executive orders as temporary. We should all want a robust yet humane process for entry screening, and I am confident we can and will continue the American ethos of welcoming the persecuted and oppressed in a safe and orderly manner, with very strong security protections for our citizens.\" No comment so far (organized by chamber and state) SENATE ",

In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Priebus was asked about reports that the executive order affected green card holders, contrary to recommendations from the Department of Homeland Security. \"We didn't overrule the Department of Homeland Security, as far as green card holders moving forward, it doesn't affect them,\" Priebus first said. But when pressed by host Chuck Todd on whether it impacts green card holders, Priebus reversed himself, saying, \"Well, of course it does. If you're traveling back and forth, you're going to be subjected to further screening.\" Related: Trump Immigration Ban Still In Place Despite Court Ruling, Says DHS Asked whether the executive order would affect U.S. citizens, he again indicated it would, suggesting it was up to the \"discretionary authority\" of a Customs and Border Patrol agent whether to question citizens coming from the countries in question. \"I would suspect that if you're an American citizen traveling back and forth to Libya you're likely to be subjected to further questioning when you come into an airport,\" he said. He also suggested the executive order could come to encompass more than the current seven countries included in the ban, and that the order focused on people coming from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen because those were identified by Congress as \"being the seven most-watched countries in regard to harboring terrorists.\" \"Perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward \u2014 but in order to do this in a way that was expeditious, in a way that would pass muster quickly, we used the 7 countries\" already identified by Congress, he said. Priebus added that the order was rolled out quickly because \"this is all done for the protection of Americans, and waiting another three days, waiting another three weeks is something that we don't want to get wrong.\" \"President Trump is not willing to get this wrong which is why he wants to move forward quickly and protect Americans,\" Priebus added. A federal judge issued an emergency stay on parts of the executive order Saturday evening, but the DHS and the White House responded early Sunday, saying that the order continues to remain in force.

    "text": "Email SANAA, Yemen -- U.S. forces launched a raid in central Yemen on Sunday, security and tribal officials said, landing troops off of aircraft and killing three alleged senior al Qaeda leaders in a battle that was the third such U.S. ground engagement against the extremist group in Yemen. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin confirms the raid took place and there may be one American casualty. \u00a0\u00a0 The surprise dawn attack in Bayda province killed Abdul-Raouf al-Dhahab, Sultan al-Dhahab, and Seif al-Nims, they said. The al-Dhahab family is considered an ally of al Qaeda, which security forces say is concentrated in Bayda province. A third family member, Tarek al-Dhahab, was killed in a previous U.S. drone strike years ago. It was not immediately clear whether the family members were actual members of al Qaeda. The fighting lasted around 45 minutes and the U.S. troops killed or wounded some two dozen men, including some Saudis present at the site, according to the Yemeni officials - who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists. U.S. military officials contacted by The Associated Press had no immediate comment but said they were looking into the report. Just over a week ago, suspected U.S. drone strikes killed three other alleged al-Qaida operatives in Bayda province in what was the first-such killings reported in the country since Donald Trump assumed the U.S. presidency. The tribal officials said the Americans were looking for al Qaeda leader Qassim al-Rimi, adding that they captured and departed with at least two unidentified individuals. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, long seen by Washington as among the most dangerous branches of the global terror network, has exploited the chaos of Yemen\u2019s civil war, seizing territory in the south and east. The war began in 2014, when Shiite Houthi rebels and their allies swept down from the north and captured the capital, Sanaa. A Saudi-led military coalition has been helping government forces battle the rebels for nearly two years. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

USA TODAY NETWORK Demonstrators at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport protest President Trump's immigration order Saturday (Photo: JOSHUA LOTT, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON \u2014 New presidents typically start with a flurry of actions designed to demonstrate to supporters and opponents alike that they will deliver on their campaign promises, and that there is a new guy in charge. But never in modern times \u2014 a phrase that Donald Trump has made familiar in his opening 10 days in the White House \u2014 has there been a whirlwind of action that has so disrupted the political order. President Trump has opened a breach with Mexico over building a wall, created chaos at U.S. airports by blocking immigrants from Muslim countries, moved to undercut\u00a0the Affordable Care Act even before Congress formally resumes debate over repealing it and more. In other words, after a campaign that upended political assumptions, Trump has grabbed the headlines and prompted protests in the streets and the courts by\u00a0doing precisely what he said he would do if elected. \"We've been in office now for about seven or eight days, and we've done an incredible amount,\" White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation after deflecting questions on the orders to begin building a wall along the southern border and to temporarily block refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries. \"I think that one thing people can say about President Trump is that he's following through on his promises, and I don't think people should be surprised that he's doing it. I'm kind of surprised that people are surprised that he's actually conducting himself exactly the way he said he would.\" It has been a surprise to those who assumed candidate Trump had more of a combative attitude than a specific policy plan. That gave rise to the observation, first credited to Saleno Zito of The Atlantic, that Trump's supporters took him seriously but not literally, while journalists took him literally but not seriously. What's also surprised many is the speed with which Trump has moved, in some cases reportedly without the traditional consultation with members of his Cabinet, leaders of Congress or even the government lawyers who customarily would review the language and legal basis for the executive orders and presidential memorandums he has signed with fanfare. Read more: How the Internet reacted to Steve Bannon's growing power in the White House Of course, presidents who have taken over at times of crisis have acted in the past with far-reaching actions and left it to the future for the courts and the critics to sort out. Franklin Roosevelt, taking over during the depths\u00a0of the Great Depression, on the day after being inaugurated in 1933 declared a\u00a0bank holiday and called Congress into special session.\u00a0When he took office in 1861, Abraham Lincoln was dealing with a nation being split by Southern secession. This time, though, Trump isn't taking over at a time of war or economic calamity. He has in effect created his own sense of crisis, a situation he seems to find useful when it comes to dominating the debate and conducting negotiations. And while FDR coined the idea of the \"first 100 days\" as a measure for decisive action, Trump seems to be speeding up even that timetable \u2014 akin to his mode of unprecedented and instantaneous presidential communication via the burst of 140-character tweets. For the new president, though, there may be surprises ahead as well. There are differences between declaring a policy as a candidate and imposing it as president,\u00a0where the details matter and institutional checks-and-balances apply. Trump's immigration order, signed late Friday, was blocked over the weekend by federal judges in at least four states. Congress could act to limit or reverse a president's actions, although in general the Republicans in control of the House and Senate have signaled support or acquiescence with Trump so far. Still, a\u00a0handful of Republicans on Sunday did raise concerns about the immigration order. Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who reportedly was a finalist to be Trump's secretary of State, said the order was \"poorly implemented\" and urged the administration to make \"appropriate revisions.\" Senate Armed Services chairman John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina issued a joint statement that said they \"fear this executive order will become\u00a0a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\" Trump responded with a tweet accusing McCain and Graham of being \"sadly weak on immigration.\" Republicans as well as Democrats also have expressed concern about Trump's openings to Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he spoke by phone Saturday.\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday on ABC's This Week\u00a0that he was opposed to lifting sanctions on Russia, a step Trump has suggested he might take. Public opinion also can be a spur or a check, since a president's standing with voters affects his clout with pols. At his inauguration, Trump had\u00a0the worst rating of any president since Gallup began routinely measuring it during Harry Truman's tenure. (The 45th president, coincidentally, had an initial rating of 45% approve-45% disapprove.) Since then, his Gallup rating has declined, on Saturday at\u00a042% approve-51% disapprove. There were demonstrations in Washington Sunday in front of the White House and the Trump International Hotel, at Boston's Copley Square and New York's Battery Park and elsewhere. That said, there are no signs that Trump is having second thoughts\u00a0or plans to slow down. On Friday night, the White House sent out a pat-on-the-back rundown titled \"President Trump's First Week of Action,\" including 15 steps it said moved toward fulfilling specific campaign promises. The second week is poised to be just as dramatic. That Supreme Court announcement? It's coming. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Got it President Trump signs an executive order Friday at the Pengagon that temporarily bans people from seven mostly Muslim countries from entering the United States. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) By Greg Miller and Missy Ryan By Greg Miller and Missy Ryan January 29 at 6:35 PM Follow @gregpmiller Follow @missy_ryan Though cast as measures meant to make the country safe, the Trump administration\u2019s moves during its first week in office are more likely to weaken the counterterrorism defenses the United States has erected over the past 16 years, several current and former U.S. officials said. Through inflammatory rhetoric and hastily drawn executive orders, the administration has alienated allies, including Iraq, provided propaganda fodder to terror networks that frequently portray U.S. involvement in the Middle East as a religious crusade, and endangered critical cooperation from often hidden U.S. partners \u2014 whether the leader of a mosque in an American suburb or the head of a Middle East intelligence service. An executive order \u2014 issued Friday and titled \u201c Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States \u201d \u2014 bans entry to people from a list of Muslim-majority nations including Iraq, where U.S. military and intelligence agencies have for years relied on cooperation from Iraqi and Kurdish authorities, not to mention thousands of individual translators and contractors. \u201cUltimately, we fear this executive order will become a self- inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,\u201d Republican Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.) said Sunday in a statement. \u201cThis executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d [ Trump redefines the enemy and 15 years of counterterrorism policy ] (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Already, supporters of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, quickly claimed the travel ban as a victory. Postings on social- media sites linked to the terrorist group predicted that President Trump\u2019s order would galvanize Muslims and claimed that it showed that the United States is at war with Islam. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In tweets Sunday, Trump said, \u201cThe joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.\u201d Separately, in a statement, Trump said the \u201cseven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror,\u201d and he noted that Obama had barred refugees from Iraq for six months in 2011. Trump\u2019s inauguration vow to put America first and \u201conly America\u201d rattled allies. A leaked draft of an order on U.S. detention policies compounded those concerns by raising the prospect of rebuilding the CIA\u2019s network of notorious \u201cblack site\u201d prisons around the world. The immigration measures imposed late Friday were seen by U.S counterterrorism officials and analysts as particularly counterproductive and poorly conceived. \u201cThe whole order is and will be read as another anti-Islam, anti-Muslim action by this president and his administration,\u201d said Paul Pillar, a former top official in the CIA\u2019s Counterterrorism Center. \u201cIt is not targeted at where the threat is, and the anti-Islam message that it sends is more likely to make America less safe.\u201d Absent from the Trump list: Saudi Arabia or any of the other countries connected to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Nor does the president\u2019s action limit travel from Pakistan, where al-Qaeda\u2019s leadership still resides. Former CIA director Michael V. Hayden said that the order and other possible measures have likely forced U.S. diplomats, military commanders and agency station chiefs abroad into damage-control mode. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good people who will work hard at it, but there is no question that this has already created an irretrievable cost,\u201d Hayden said. The refu\u00adgee order \u201cinarguably has made us less safe. It has taken draconian measures against a threat that was hyped. The by-product is it feeds the jihadist narrative and makes it harder for our allies to side with us.\u201d Despite acute concerns about the impact overseas, analysts said much of the damage may happen in the United States. Counterterrorism officials have for years cast the successful integration of Muslims in the United States as a major security advantage over countries in Europe, where Muslims are more likely to be isolated and marginalized. Those who study extremism fear that the sense of belonging among U.S. Muslims may begin to fray, increasing the likelihood that a U.S. citizen or resident becomes radicalized, and complicates the already-difficult task for the FBI and local authorities to cultivate relationships with Muslim community leaders. \u201cIt was already an uphill climb,\u201d said Seamus Hughes, a former National Counterterrorism Center official who frequently traveled the country to meet with Muslim community members after terrorist attacks. [ A raid in Yemen leads to the first combat death of the Trump era ] Tips to the FBI or local police from concerned parents, religious leaders and concerned Muslim citizens have been \u201cthe lifeblood of most terrorism investigations\u201d in the United States, said Hughes, who is now at George Washington University. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone hesitating to report an imminent threat,\u201d he said, but adding, \u201cI can\u2019t see these orders as helping.\u201d Marcel Lettre, who oversaw intelligence matters at the Pentagon until earlier this month, said the new measures could impact decisions by allies in Europe or the Middle East, possibly affecting intelligence-sharing and law enforcement cooperation. \u201cThe political and policy environment might make it such that their publics will insist that they distance themselves from us in terms of tight partnering,\u201d Lettre said. \u200b But Rep. Devin Nunes (R- Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement, \u201cIn light of attempts by jihadist groups to infiltrate fighters into refugee flows to the West, along with Europe\u2019s tragic experience coping with this problem, the Trump Administration\u2019s executive order on refugees is a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland.\u201d In terms of overseas partnerships, no relationship has been placed under more immediate strain than that of the United States and Iraq. Trump used his speech at CIA headquarters on his first day in office to declare that it was a mistake for the United States not to have seized Iraq\u2019s oil reserves after the U.S. invasion in 2003, and to hint that there might be another chance to do so. The executive order sparked confusion and condemnation in Baghdad. Iraqis who had worked with the U.S. military for years, often at great risk, were among the first people affected by the regulations. Even before the new measures were issued, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters that his country\u2019s oil \u201cis for Iraqis.\u201d The comment also explicitly confirmed widely held suspicions in the Middle East of U.S. geopolitical motivations. \u201cIt\u2019s about oil and it\u2019s a plot to destroy Islam,\u201d said Dan Byman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. \u201cIf you want to combine conspiracy theories, [Trump] is doing a good job.\u201d Iraqi lawmakers over the weekend insisted that Iraq impose similar measures on the United States. Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential Shiite cleric, called the decision to block Iraqi entry while Americans still come and go, \u201carrogance,\u201d and he demanded that U.S. nationals leave the country. Iraqis also have questioned the omission from the travel ban of certain Gulf and North Africa countries, whose nationals have been involved in high-profile terrorist attacks Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for Abadi, said that the U.S. security partnership with Iraq, including American support for operations against the Islamic State and a robust arms sales program, should make the relationship with Iraq different from other countries on the list. The new measures take place as the Pentagon continues to rely closely on Iraq in its campaign to defeat the Islamic State. More than 6,000 U.S. troops are now stationed in the country, advising Iraqi forces during a major battle in Mosul, the militant-held northern city. The decision undermines Abadi, straddled between a Western ally whose support he needs to fight militants and Shiite political peers who view the U.S. presence with hostility. Lukman Faily, who served as the Iraqi ambassador in Washington until last year, said that Abadi would try to draw a distinction between Iraq\u2019s security partnership with the United States and the perceived snub contained in Trump\u2019s new order \u201cIt will certainly put the prime minister in the most awkward position,\u201d Faily said. \u201cIt will not help him navigate his politics while he\u2019s completing [a major battle] and while he has an oil crisis to deal with.\u201d Hadithi sought to stress the temporary nature of the order. \u201cWe will have a discussion with the American side,\u201d Hadithi said. \u201cIf it\u2019s only for a short time to reorganize their visa and refugees work, we will understand it and take it positively.\u201d It\u2019s not yet clear, however, whether the 90-day period stipulated in the executive order will be extended.

    "text": "Protests Build Across the Country Against Trump's Immigration Order By Ben Gittleson Jan 29, 2017, 7:59 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Backlash Grows Against Trump's Immigration Order 0 Shares Email President Trump defended his executive order restricting the entry into the U.S. of people from seven Muslim-dominated countries, saying the move was not about religion but about keeping the country safe, but administration officials appeared to backtrack on the scope of the order, even as demonstrators gathered across the U.S. to protest. Massive crowds packed Boston's Copley Square, Battery Park in New York City and outside the White House, and public areas in other cities, with demonstrations also held at airports from coast to coast to protest the order, which suspended immigration from countries with ties to terror -- Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Libya -- for 90 days. The order also indefinitely suspends Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. Trump said in a statement released today that the countries chosen for what he called the \"extreme vetting\" of the order had been \"identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.\" \"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe,\" the statement reads. The administration, however, appeared to backtrack on one element of the order, saying late today that green card holders from those seven countries were not barred from re-entering the U.S., whereas earlier the administration had indicated they were. Some Colleges Warning Foreign Students on Travel After Trump's Immigration Order \"In applying the provisions of the president's executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest,\" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement today. \"Accordingly, absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.\" A senior administration official confirmed this evening that legal permanent U.S. residents are exempt from the executive order. The official said the people who were set aside for additional screening were a \"fractional marginal minuscule percentage\" of travelers and said it is not an injury for green card and visa holders to be subject to additional screening. The order has been criticized by Democratic elected officials and 16 attorneys general released a statement condemning the order as unconstitutional. \"We are confident that the Executive Order will ultimately be struck down by the courts. In the meantime, we are committed to working to ensure that as few people as possible suffer from the chaotic situation that it has created,\" said the statement, issued jointly by attorneys general of California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. A number of Republicans have also criticized the order, including Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who issued a joint statement today. \"It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted,\" the senators said. \"We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. \"Such a hasty process risks harmful results,\" the statement said. \"Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism ... Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred.\" Protesters marched along Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol this afternoon, chanting, \"No hate, no fear. Refugees are welcome here,\" and \"No Ban. No wall.\" According to immigrant and refugee advocacy groups, a number of people were being held today at airports across the country with some facing imminent deportation despite the stay on deportations issued by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. aaronds/Instagram Protesters of President Donald Trump's immigration ban gather at Copley Park in Boston, Jan. 29, 2017. Among the people held after the ruling, according to Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, were: A 2-year-old U.S. citizen with green card-holding parents and a 66-year-old woman traveling from Iraq to visit her son, an active-duty U.S. service member who flew up to North Carolina to help her. A lot of people were being handcuffed, Heller said. In one dramatic case late last night, an Iranian Fulbright scholar whose friends were waiting for her at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was forced to board a Ukraine International Airlines flight just before midnight -\u2013 hours after a federal court in Brooklyn issued a stay on the order, according to Heller. Only after high-level intervention did the plane turn around on the tarmac and let the woman deplane, Heller said. Genna Martin/seattlepi.com viaAP Seattle city councilwoman Kshama Sawant raises a fist over the crowd, as more than 1,000 people gather at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to protest President Donald Trump's order that restricts immigration to the U.S., Jan. 28, 2017. The International Refugee Assistance Project encouraged anyone with a green card to reroute their flight through Boston if they don't want to be detained, after a ruling there said people couldn\u2019t be deported or detained. The New York ruling said people couldn't be deported, but it allowed detention. The advocates and lawyers said the haphazard implementation of the order has resulted in what Heller called \"rogue\" Customs and Border Protection officers pressuring green card holders to cancel them. She said that CBP officers repeatedly told them they were awaiting more information from Washington; finally, they stopped talking and \"told us to just call President Trump,\" Heller said. The groups said they're examining rulings in Boston, New York, and Virginia, to see whether there is overlap and whether they complement each other, and determine whether the rulings applied nationwide. In the case of the New York ruling, they said that the order did, but in the case of Boston, it was unclear, as it appeared it would, although it contained local references. Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters Activists gather outside the White House to protest President Donald Trump's executive actions on immigration, in Washington, Jan. 29, 2017. Thousands of attorneys have turned out en masse across the country, they said, including more than 4,000 people who signed up to help with the IRAP and many more showing up own their own, too. The executive director of the National Immigration Law Center said about 2,000 lawyers had formed a group dedicated to providing support on a regular basis. Protesters at airports across the country reacted with jubilation Saturday night at the news that in response to a legal challenge issued by the ACLU a federal court in Brooklyn had granted an emergency stay on the president's executive order that bans immigration from Syria , Yemen, Sudan, Somalia , Iraq, Iran and Libya. Following the court's decision, the Department of Homeland Security said in a press release that it \"will continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people.\" The statement noted that Trump's executive orders remain \"in place,\" despite the emergency stay. \"The president's Executive Orders remain in place -- prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" the release said. The ACLU contended that the stay applied nationally to all cases, but that was not necessarily clear from the ruling, and an atmosphere of confusion still surrounds the orders, and how they will be applied going forward. Today, the spontaneous protests that were sparked by news of travelers being detained were expected to continue in a more planned fashion at airports across the country. carrie1010/Instagram Protesters of Donald Trump's immigration ban rally at Copley Square in Boston, Jan. 29, 2017. The protests started Saturday at John F. Kennedy International Airport, where hundreds of people chanted \"No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here,\" angered at the detention of a number of people arriving from the countries listed in Trump's order, including the two Iraqi men whose cases were taken by the ACLU. As the day went on, the protests spread to other major airports like Washington Dulles International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. The two Iraqis who were detained at JFK were both released later in the day, drawing widespread media attention. One of the men, Hameed Jhalid Darweesh, expressed his gratitude for those who supported him while he was detained. \"America is the land of freedom,\" Darweesh said. \"The land of freedom, the land of the rights. This is what brought me to come here, and I'm very thankful.\" Neither Darweesh nor the other Iraqi were technically refugees according to the definition in the president's executive order at the time of their detention, but appear to have come to the U.S. on visas, a Trump administration official told ABC News. A senior Department of Homeland Security official said that 375 travelers were affected by the executive order Saturday at airports across the country. Within that group, 109 people were in transit and then denied entry to the U.S., 173 were denied entry to the U.S. before boarding their flights in a foreign port, and 81 were granted waivers because of their legal permanent resident or special immigrant visa status. The number of people being held at U.S. airports is expected to dwindle today, but passengers at airports across the world may be kept from boarding flights to the U.S. Trump said the executive order was part of a vetting plan to prevent \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from reaching American soil. The seven-page document calls for an immediate suspension of immigration from countries with ties to terror -- Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Libya -- for a time period of 90 days. But none of the countries on the list have had anything to do with terror incidents on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks, and Saudi Arabia -- where 15 of the 9/11 hijackers were from -- is not included. It also calls for the complete suspension of Syrian refugees for an indefinite period. It also calls on the secretary of state to suspend the entire U.S program for admitting refugees for 120 days while authorities review the application and adjudication process. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said today on \"This Week\" that the seven countries had been identified by the Obama administration as needing further scrutiny, and said other countries could be added to the list at a later date.

    "text": "Privacy Policy The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, sent a letter to federal officials Sunday demanding information about those held at John F. Kennedy International Airport after receiving what he called \u201calarming reports\u201d that the federal government was planning to violate the court order. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In an interview, Mr. Schneiderman said that the executive order was unconstitutional and that he and other attorneys general were exploring the possibility of legal action. \u201cThere may be grounds for a claim that this does damage to a state, if they\u2019re damaging our state institutions\u201d like universities and hospitals, he said. The president has broad power to control immigration. A federal law allows him to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants\u201d if he determines that their entry \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d But another law appears to limit that power, saying that \u201cno person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\u201d Saturday\u2019s court orders, issued in haste, contained little reasoning. Judge Donnelly, in Brooklyn, wrote that there was a strong likelihood that the two plaintiffs in the case, who seek to represent a class of refugees, visa holders and others, could establish that their removal would violate the Constitution\u2019s due process and equal protection guarantees. Based on that conclusion and the \u201cirreparable injury\u201d the plaintiffs would suffer, Judge Donnelly issued a temporary nationwide injunction barring their removal. She did not order their release. The order in Boston, from Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the Federal District Court there, was in one sense broader and in another narrower. It limited border screening practices to those in place before Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, and it barred not only removal but also detention. But it seemed to be limited to people arriving or held at Logan International Airport there. The order from Judge Leonie M. Brinkema of the Federal District Court in Alexandria applied only to legal permanent residents being held at Dulles International Airport. The order in Seattle, from Judge Thomas S. Zilly of the Federal District Court there, applied to two plaintiffs. It is possible that one of the four cases will definitively resolve an important aspect of the legality of Mr. Trump\u2019s order. But the cases were filed very quickly, and civil rights litigators generally like to locate ideal plaintiffs and hone their legal theories before filing test cases that could turn into legal landmarks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Brooklyn case, for instance, did not make a claim based on the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of government establishment of religion, though some lawyers said that was the executive order\u2019s central flaw. \u201cThe smoking gun they put in the executive order is the idea that they would grant exceptions for minority religions,\u201d Mr. Romero said. Mr. Trump has said that was meant to favor Christians over Muslims. But opening such a challenge requires preparation, Mr. Cole said. \u201cThe one thing you can\u2019t do under the establishment clause is denomination favoritism,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very promising claim, but it requires the right plaintiff.\u201d Follow Adam Liptak on Twitter @adamliptak .

Email White House chief of staff Reince Priebus defended President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying it\u2019s intended to protect the country -- and even suggested more countries could be added to the list going forward. \u201cThis is not a Muslim ban,\u201d Priebus told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cAll this is is identifying the seven countries -- and the reason we chose those seven countries is those were the seven countries that both the Congress and the Obama administration identified as being the seven countries that were most identifiable with dangerous terrorism taking place in their country.\u201d Since Mr. Trump signed the executive order on Friday, he\u2019s come under heavy criticism from foreign leaders and U.S. elected officials alike. As visa holders from the affected countries landed at U.S. airports and were detained this weekend, thousands of people protested outside airports like New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport and Dulles Airport in the Washington, D.C. area. Currently, Mr. Trump\u2019s order applies to citizens of seven countries: Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. However, Priebus said Sunday that the list of countries could grow. \u201cYou can point to other countries that have similar problems like Pakistan and others -- perhaps we need to take it further,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for now, immediate steps, pulling the Band-Aid off, is to do further vetting for people traveling in and out of those countries.\u201d Priebus reiterated that Mr. Trump is merely following through on his campaign promises , and that he\u2019s \u201cnot willing to be wrong\u201d on the issue of immigration. \u201cThis was a promise that President Trump had made and it\u2019s a promise that he\u2019s going to keep,\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s not willing to be wrong on this subject -- we need to do our best to be vigilant and protect Americans.\u201d He defended the fact that the order has meant valid green card holders , not just regular visa holders, have been detained as well, saying Customs and Border Patrol has always had \u201cwide discretion\u201d in asking questions of people entering the country. \u201cThe point is, though, valid visas are great but it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be subjected to further questioning,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d Asked repeatedly whether the Trump administration consulted with or notified the U.S.\u2019 Arab allies before signing the order, Priebus wouldn\u2019t answer -- but said that notifying too many people beforehand would have tipped off potential terrorists and allowed them to get into the country before the deadline. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to advertise to the world that we\u2019re going to put a stop or at least further vetting on travel in and out of our country from these seven places,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people have suggested ... that maybe we should have given everyone a three-day warning -- well, that would just mean that a terrorist would move up their travel by three days.\u201d Priebus said Mr. Trump\u2019s hour-long phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday was a \u201cpositive call,\u201d but declined to say whether the two men discussed Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the contents line by line,\u201d he said. \u201c...It was an initial call, it was more of a congratulatory call \u2026 in the end, people should be encouraged by the fact that we\u2019re starting off on a decent footing with leaders around the world, including President Putin.\u201d As for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which Mr. Trump authorized in another executive order last week , Priebus said there is \u201cno final conclusion\u201d about how the wall will be paid for. \u201cIt can either be through a tax on goods coming across the border, it could be through tax reform and a formula on import and export taxes and credits, it could be on drug cartels and it could be on people that are coming here illegally and paying fines,\u201d he said. \u201cOr it could be, you know, all of the above. There e is a buffet of options that we have in order to pay for this wall.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Got it Demonstrators gather outside the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Sunday to protest President Trump's executive order on immigration. (Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post) (Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post) By Michael Kranish and Robert Barnes By Michael Kranish and Robert Barnes January 29 at 6:18 PM Follow @PostKranish Follow @scotusreporter President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration, parts of which have already been put on hold by several federal judges, is likely to face a series of new legal challenges about whether it violates a 1965 anti-discrimination law and the Constitution, scholars said Sunday. Trump\u2019s order cites seven \u00adMuslim-dominant countries, and the president has signaled he favors Christian entrants over Muslims. Four federal judges have put various holds on the ban, and other courts are expected to consider similar stays. A group of 16 state attorneys general said Sunday they believe the executive order is unconstitutional, likely presaging an intense round of legal action against it. Ruthann Robson, professor of law at City University of New York School of Law, said the fact that all four judges who had reviewed the order by Sunday afternoon put various holds on it indicates that the measure faces serious challenge. \u201cWhen the federal judges are ruling on the injunctions, one of the requirements is that they have to say that there is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs will prevail on the merits,\u201d Robson said in an interview. Robson is among the legal scholars who said the order could be thrown out on grounds that it violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution. She noted that courts have criticized governmental distinctions based on ancestry and race. (The Washington Post) The wording of Trump\u2019s order in particular may expose it to legal challenges, experts said. It cites the need to protect the nation against a terrorist act such as those occurring on Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 even though the terrorists involved in that attack did not come from the seven nations cited in Trump\u2019s order, a fact that legal advocates are likely to cite in their challenges. [ Trump defends executive order: \u2018This is not a Muslim ban\u2019 ] The order has caused much confusion since it was released Friday. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security was quoted Saturday by the Reuters news agency as saying it applied to holders of green cards, who are legal residents. Yet White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Sunday on NBC-TV\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that \u201cit doesn\u2019t affect them.\u201d Later in the same broadcast, however, Priebus said, \u201cWell, of course it does [affect them]. If you\u2019re traveling back and forth, you\u2019re going to be subjected to further screening.\u201d Such parsing of the order\u2019s meaning could be cited in legal challenges as evidence that it is unclear. There were initial reports that the White House did not vet the order with the Justice Department, which led to widespread criticism on legal blogs and elsewhere that the measure was poorly conceived and thus open to legal challenge. Republican Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) said in a joint statement Sunday: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security.\u201d Priebus, however, said officials throughout the government \u201cknew full well what was going on.\u201d Still, David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said a key portion of the order, pertaining to legal residents, is illegal. He cited a 1965 immigration law stating that no person applying to be a permanent resident can be discriminated against based on gender, race or national origin. \u201cIt is not legal for the president to target people who are coming to live in the United States permanently,\u201d Bier said. It would take an act of Congress to make such a distinction legal, he said. Trump also may have encouraged legal challenges by suggesting that he favored Christians from the seven nations entering the United States. \u201cIf you were a Muslim, you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible,\u201d Trump said in an interview Friday with the Christian Broadcasting Network. \u201cI thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d Additionally, Trump\u2019s executive order said that those who suffered religious persecution should be given priority, \u201cprovided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion.\u201d The seven Muslim-majority nations targeted by Trump are: Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Iraq. A host of groups are gearing up for legal battle, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which won the injunction from a New York judge Saturday, immigrant legal aid societies, public interest groups and the alliance of 16 state attorney generals. Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, issued a statement Sunday saying he and his colleagues in 15 other states representing 130 million Americans and foreign residents \u201care confident that the Executive Order will ultimately be struck down by the courts.\u201d The attorneys general said they would work together to ensure the federal government \u201cdoes not unlawfully target anyone because of their national origin or faith.\u201d The ACLU, in winning the injunction in New York, argued that the government was seeking to deport an individual to Syria. Judge Ann M. Donnelly, a federal judge for the Eastern District of New York, ruled that sending the individual to Syria would cause \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d and she prevented the Trump administration from doing so. Donnelly wrote in her order that she ruled in the ACLU\u2019s favor because it has \u201ca strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and others similarly situated violates their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u201d The Trump administration asked for two weeks to respond to the injunction. The first step for the Trump administration would be to challenge the adverse judicial orders. That could be done by appealing those decisions to the federal appeals courts in the regions where they were issued or by going directly to the Supreme Court. The administration did not reveal its legal strategy Sunday. A constitutional challenge to the order could come later. The Supreme Court is still short-handed, operating with only eight justices since Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death last February. Trump is expected to announce his nominee for the court this week, and a confirmation process typically last months. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case on behalf of the Syrian-born individual in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, was asked in a conference call with reporters whether Trump administration officials could be held in contempt of court. \u201cEventually you could get to something like contempt, but we\u2019re a long way from that,\u201d Gelernt said.

Remember the face. Thank you, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly. #ACLU #MuslimBan @realDonaldTrump don't attack her. pic.twitter.com/J3DX7MF1m3 \u2014 Bill Marler (@bmarler) January 29, 2017 Ann M. Donnelly waited half\u00a0a year for her chance to convince the Senate that she would make a good federal judge. When the day finally came, she packed\u00a0as many relatives as she could into the benches. In her opening comments, she named every single one of them. Donnelly introduced the senators to her husband, Michael. Her sister Sarah and brother Thomas. And then their spouses and their four children. And to\u00a0her mother and late father \u2014 \u201cI know he is watching,\u201d she told the Judiciary Committee in the spring of 2015.\u00a0And her two daughters, and their boyfriends. And then Saturday night, after a year and a week on the federal bench, Donnelly sat in her own courtroom in Brooklyn while families shouted and cried in airports across the country. President Trump\u2019s sudden ban on refugees and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries had interrupted reunions midflight, leaving aunts, nephews, fathers and daughters stranded on opposite sides of security cordons , while federal officials decided who would be deported by presidential decree. That\u2019s the night the daughter of Mary and Jack Donnelly \u2014 whose speeches\u00a0and rulings had rarely traveled beyond courthouse walls \u2014 became known across the world as the first judge to block Trump\u2019s order. Never before in her long legal career had Donnelly gained such attention. Nowhere close. Her old college roommate, Darcy Gibson Berglund, remembers the Ohio-raised English major starring in a campus rendition of \u201cPippin\u201d in the late 1970s but then quickly leaving\u00a0the stage\u00a0for the law. \u201cShe\u2019s an intellectual, she was not going to pursue theater,\u201d Berglund said. But she said her friend retained \u201ca facility with language\u201d after graduating from law school in 1984. Donnelly\u00a0spent the next quarter-century as a New York prosecutor. Her most famous case was against two executives who looted their company \u2014 a trial that the New York Times described as \u201csix months of sometimes tedious testimony.\u201d The paper recounted Donnelly\u2019s closing arguments in the Tyco International case, when she \u201cat times seemed like a schoolteacher lecturing her students.\u201d The executives \u201cbelieved they were above the law, and they believe the rules that apply to other people do not apply to them,\u201d Donnelly\u00a0told the jury in 2004. The men were convicted. This week, some of Donnelly\u2019s old colleagues praised her demeanor during that\u00a0trial \u2014\u00a0one telling the Times she was \u201cthe calm center of the spinning wheel,\u201d \u00a0even then. She made state judge a few years after her victory in the Tyco trial, in 2009, and for years handled mostly\u00a0criminal trials. [ Trump official appears to walk back inclusion of green-card holders in travel ban ] Donnelly would later tell senators that sentencing someone to prison \u201cis one of the most difficult tasks a judge faces.\u201d Some of her cases, however, were so horrific it didn\u2019t seem hard. \u201cNot only did you strangle this woman, you then chopped her up,\u201d she told a man in 2010, according to the New York Daily News, \u00a0before\u00a0sentencing him to 19 years to life for killing his ex-girlfriend and burying her in concrete. If the killer were ever released, the paper noted, he would be deported because he had come to\u00a0the United States illegally. Several years later, a populist Republican would begin crafting campaign speeches around\u00a0violent immigrants. But first, Donnelly had to wait. And wait, and wait, and wait after President Barack Obama nominated her to the federal court\u00a0in November 2014, promising she would \u201cserve the American people with integrity and an unwavering commitment to justice.\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee did not hold hearings to approve her for months, a common theme in an era when White House and Congress stood divided. [ McConnell: We don\u2019t have religious tests in this country ] \u201cI\u2019m thrilled the committee is finally moving forward,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer\u00a0(D-N.Y.) said in May 2015. \u201cI know Ann well.\u201d He spoke of her parents in Ohio, and her work prosecuting sex crimes. He told his colleagues of an office Donnelly had\u00a0left long ago, where \u201cher reputation is legendary.\u201d \u201cShe is at her core a kind, thoughtful, compassionate person,\u201d Schumer said. He asked her family to stand. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, it\u2019s a great sight.\u201d Donnelly\u2019s mother and\u00a0a dozen-some\u00a0siblings, children, spouses, nieces and friends all rose in the chamber. One woman wiped tears from her eyes after\u00a0Donnelly took the table at the front of the room. The senators asked her only two questions, and only about criminal law. \u201cIt\u2019s a certain risk a judge takes,\u201d Donnelly\u00a0told Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), speaking of times she had tried to rehabilitate rather than punish a young offender,\u00a0in hopes to\u00a0\u201csave someone from what is bound to be a life of crime.\u201d But mostly, Donnelly\u00a0spoke of her family before ceding the table and waiting for the Senate\u2019s decision. Another half a year passed until the Senate confirmed her, nearly unanimously, with only two nays. [ Senate Democrats vow legislation to block Trump\u2019s travel ban ] Yet more months went by before Donnelly was sworn in, quoting Abraham Lincoln in Brooklyn, and speaking\u00a0once again about her family. She\u00a0made no great news\u00a0for a full year on the federal bench \u2014 until\u00a0Saturday evening, when protesters thronged major U.S.\u00a0airports and an executive with the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted directions to Donnelly\u2019s\u00a0courthouse. \u201cGo right now if you can,\u201d he wrote. It had by then been a full day since Trump signed an executive order he said would \u201ckeep radical Islamic terrorists\u201d out of the country \u2014 but which turned out to instantly bar people who had spent weeks or years planning journeys to the United States, and in some cases were already here. Thank you Judge Donnelly !! You have upheld the constitution today and America thanks you !! #muslimban #RefugeeBan #RefugeesWelcome pic.twitter.com/KKy9VV3n4h \u2014 Guthrie Graves-Fitz. (@GuthrieGF) January 29, 2017 They had names like Labeeb Ali, who told The Washington Post he had sold his business and belongings in Iraq and obtained a U.S. visa before finding out at the airport\u00a0he couldn\u2019t board his flight. And Binto Adan, who The Post reported had flown thousands of\u00a0miles with her 8- and 9-year-old children expecting to see her husband but who ended up being detained all day at Dulles International Airport because her\u00a0family was Somali. \u201cI am looking for my parents! They are elderly!\u201d a crying woman shouted in the same airport that night. And in cities from Dallas to Seattle, bewildered families sought missing members,\u00a0and the ACLU\u2019s emergency request to stop the deportations found its way to Donnelly\u2019s courtroom in New York. She had once been a government lawyer, but that night, she showed little patience for\u00a0their\u00a0arguments,\u00a0 The Post reported. \u201cOur own government presumably approved their entry to the country,\u201d Donnelly said, weighing the risks of\u00a0sending unknown numbers of people back across the oceans. An ACLU lawyer interrupted the hearing\u00a0to warn\u00a0Donnelly that a flier was about to be deported to war-torn Syria unless she acted\u00a0immediately. Donnelly asked whether the government could guarantee that person\u2019s safety and, unconvinced by\u00a0their answer, issued her order just before 9 p.m. Sending travelers back could cause \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d she ruled. She\u2019d turned more eloquent phrases, but this time her\u00a0written words were photographed and immediately shared across the world. Stay of ban removals pic.twitter.com/jZjtidm2IF \u2014 Omar C. Jadwat (@OmarJadwat) January 29, 2017 \u201cStay is granted,\u201d the executive director of the ACLU\u00a0Voting Rights Project wrote on Twitter. \u201cStay is national.\u201d ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt announces to a crowd outside a Brooklyn courthouse that a federal judge had stayed deportations nationwide of those detained on entry to the United States following an executive order from President Trump that targeted citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. (ACLU Nationwide/Facebook) By early Sunday morning, tearful and exhausted people\u00a0were emerging from security areas across the United States. They had no guarantee for their future in the United States, but they had\u00a0a reprieve from immediate deportation. And as\u00a0families\u00a0filtered out into the cities, the name of a federal judge they\u2019d never heard of was in headlines across the globe. An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly\u00a0to the \u201cfederal circuit.\u201d Donnelly is a federal judge for the Eastern District of New York. 1 of 29 ",

Google said it was \u201cconcerned.\u201d Apple said, \u201cIt is not a policy we support.\u201d Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. On the other hand, IBM, whose chief executive, Virginia M.

Around 10 a.m., Mr. Chesky of Airbnb posted a vague message on Twitter saying \u201copen doors bring all of US together.\u201d By 6 p.m., he was advocating open protest. Early Sunday morning, he wrote a memo to employees warning that Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy was \u201ca direct obstacle to our mission.\u201d Airbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US. Stayed tuned for more, contact me if urgent need for housing \u2014         Brian Chesky (@bchesky) Jan. 29, 2017 It was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. \u201cIt feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,\u201d said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One. Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists. Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media. At Twitter, a number of workers felt frustrated with the disconnect between their company\u2019s product \u2014 a platform for free speech \u2014 and the extent to which Mr. Trump has used it to attack those who question him and proclaim outright falsehoods to the American public. On Saturday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, posted and reposted numerous messages denouncing the travel ban. At Facebook, employees felt a similar sense of discord. Some complained about how long it took Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, to speak out. Others were upset at the continued presence of Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s, as a director on Facebook\u2019s board. Mr. Thiel was a donor to Mr. Trump's campaign and has since become an adviser, and he issued a statement on Saturday evening that reaffirmed his support for the president. Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day. In an email to employees on Saturday titled \u201cStanding up for what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday. As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers \u2014 largely immigrants \u2014 began a one-hour work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order. Uber did not follow suit. Instead, i t posted on Twitter that it was suspending surge pricing at Kennedy Airport. That prompted accusations that it was trying to break the strike, which the company awkwardly denied in another Twitter post . On Sunday morning, its competitor Lyft said it was donating $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union over the next four years \u201cto defend our Constitution.\u201d On Sunday afternoon, Uber sharpened its criticism of the ban, calling it \u201c wrong and unjust. \u201d Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent start-up incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen. \u201cAfter the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,\u201d Mr. Altman said. \u201cNow they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come.\u201d Mr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p.m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join.

Stephanie Keith/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Protestors rally during a demonstration against the new immigration ban issued by President Donald Trump at John F. Kennedy International Airport on January 28, 2017 in New York City. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images By the time the sun rose on Sunday in the U.S., the chaotic weekend set in motion by Trump's executive order on immigration was beginning to give way to greater clarity \u2014 in some respects, at least. That order \u2014 which temporarily bars citizens from seven largely Muslim countries, as well as all refugees, from entering the U.S. \u2014 was blocked in part by a federal judge in Brooklyn on Saturday night. Judge Ann Donnelly issued a stay that would temporarily prevent federal agents from deporting anyone who entered the U.S. with a valid visa. Two additional federal district courts have issued restraining orders regarding President Trump's executive order on immigration. The orders, from Virginia and Massachusetts district courts, are effective for seven days. Trump, for his part, tweeted an ardent defense of his immigration freeze Sunday. Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 Meanwhile at major international airports, both across the U.S. and around the world, that decision did little to ease the maelstrom of protests, outraged politicians and lawyers scrambling to offer legal help to refugees who had been blocked or detained. Article continues after sponsorship From the scenes at airports and the impact on families to reactions from foreign leaders \u2014 here is what we know Sunday. The Detainees And Deportees Trump's executive order bars citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan \u2014 including those who hold green cards as legal permanent residents of the U.S. That last detail came as a surprise to Hessam Noorian and his wife, who were detained for more than five hours with their 6-month-old son at Chicago's O'hare Airport. She is a citizen; he has a green card. They had been returning from a trip to Iran when they heard President Trump might ban travel by refugees, the couple told NPR's David Schaper. \"But I didn't know this applied to green card. I thought as long as you have green card, then you're are safe, you are fine,\" she said.

Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images After they had been questioned and searched by authorities, they were released. Others, like a traveler from Iraq who spoke with NPR's Jeff Brady, remain less certain. His wife said he was detained at Philadelphia International Airport. A half-day later, as she spoke with Jeff, she had still not been able to reach him to learn what had happened. At the same airport, federal authorities deported two families from Syria despite legal paperwork to enter the U.S. \"Banning immigrants and refugees is not only unjustifiably cruel, it also puts Americans at home and serving abroad at great risk,\" said Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney in a statement. \"The Trump administration very well may have just given these families a death sentence.\" In Seattle, lawyers \"were able to spare at least two people placed on a departure flight back out of the U.S.,\" reports Liz Jones of member station KUOW. \"But at least one refugee from Somalia was deported.\" Sara Assali of Allentown, Pa., told Bobby Allyn of WHYY that she had been expecting six members of her Orthodox Christian family from Damascus, Syria, on Saturday. That reunion had been 14 years in coming, Assali said, and all six had finally obtained their visas in 2015. But Assali said U.S. Customs and Border Patrol detained her family members and told them they would need to fly instead to Doha, Qatar, or risk losing green cards and visas. \"We weren't expecting this because we paid everything. The green cards have been paid for, the visas have been paid for, everything has been approved,\" Assali said. \"To suddenly be told, 'No, you no longer qualify to enter the country,' it kind of comes as a slap in the face.' \" The Protests And Political Backlash By the end of Saturday, protesters had gathered outside several airports and inside baggage claims to register their objection to Trump's executive order. Mayor Marty Walsh addressed the demonstrators outside Boston's Logan International Airport, asking them to \"join us\" and \"stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters.\" We\u2019ll fight today, and we\u2019ll fight tomorrow. Join us at 1 p.m. on Sunday at Copley Square. pic.twitter.com/zrH3cd2eXl \u2014 Mayor Marty Walsh (@marty_walsh) January 29, 2017 At New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport, where The Associated Press reports 12 refugees were detained Saturday, the protests assembled early in the day and gathered momentum by nightfall. \"I never thought I'd see the day when refugees, who have fled war-torn countries in search of a better life, would be turned away at our doorstep,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement supporting the demonstrators. \"This is not who we are, and not who we should be.\" Demonstrators protest against President Trump's executive immigration ban at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on January 28, 2017.

Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images The international airport in Charlotte, N.C., drew protesters on Saturday, as well. The demonstrations there grew more acrimonious than most, as six people were arrested after police and protesters \"engaged in a brief skirmish,\" reports Nick de la Canal of member station WFAE. But the Rev. Jay McKinnon, an organizer of the Charlotte protests who spoke to de la Canal, said he would not be dissuaded from further protest. Trump is \"doing what he said he would do,\" McKinnon said Saturday. \"It's a resistance to that \u2014 to his policies, to him thinking that this is okay in our name.\" Reaction Beyond U.S. Borders Initially, British Prime Minister Theresa May was noncommittal in her judgment of the executive order. On a diplomatic trip in Turkey on Saturday, May deferred to Trump, telling reporters only that \"the United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees.\" Overnight, however, the line from 10 Downing Street drew a slightly sharper contrast. \"Immigration policy in the United States is a matter for the government of the United States, just the same as immigration policy for this country should be set by our government,\" her office said through a spokesperson, according to The Guardian . \"But we do not agree with this kind of approach and it is not one we will be taking.\" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, speaking at a news conference in Paris, \"questioned how such orders could be imposed by a country that embraces Christian values like the U.S.,\" NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin. Still stronger rebukes came from the countries listed on Trump's immigration freeze. \"President Trump is dealing with Iraq as if the U.S. had no relationship with the country,\" Razaq al-Haidari, a member of Iraq's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told NPR's Alice Fordham. \"When in fact the US leads an anti-ISIS coalition working to improve Iraq's armed forces and thousands of American soldiers, officials and advisers are operating there.\" Others in Iraq took an even harder line, Alice reports. \"A spokesman of a powerful bloc of paramilitary forces says all Americans should now be banned from Iraq, and all Americans in Iraq should be deported,\" Alice says. Where Do We Go From Here? The temporary stay issued by the federal judge in Brooklyn appears to cover as many as 200 people across the country, NPR's Carrie Johnson reports. But that stay, which addresses only those who traveled to the U.S. before the immigration freeze was enacted, means only that they cannot be deported immediately. Carrie breaks it down: \"Judge Ann Donnelly found that sending the travelers home could cause them irreparable harm to the refugees and no harm to the us government. The judge didn't make a broad ruling about the constitutional claims in the case.\" The Department of Homeland Security says that it intends to continue enforcing the order, and that it retains the right to revoke visas. But advocate groups have vowed to escalate the fight against the executive order in court. ",

Morty Ortega / Getty Images Protesters gather at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Saturday to denounce President Trump's executive order banning immigrants from certain nations. Protesters gather at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Saturday to denounce President Trump's executive order banning immigrants from certain nations. (G. Morty Ortega / Getty Images) Matt Pearce and Shashank Bengali Contact Reporter Jeffrey Buchalter was reflooring\u00a0his foyer in Chesapeake Beach, Md., and listening to MSNBC over the weekend when he heard the news: An Iraqi who had worked with American forces as an interpreter had been stopped from entering the U.S.\u00a0under a new executive order on immigration from President Trump. The story stopped him cold. Buchalter, an Army veteran who works as a law-enforcement instructor\u00a0at the Department of Homeland Security, had served multiple tours of duty as a military policeman\u00a0in Iraq, service that cost him dearly. He was decorated for injuries sustained from gunfire and improvised explosive devices. Exams revealed he\u2019d suffered herniated discs, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, and he spent 2 \u00bd years at Walter Reed Army Medical Center trying to get right. Read the story But he was still alive, and now the married father of two children. And he believes that\u2019s thanks in part to the work of Iraqi interpreters who acted as guides during his work in their country.\u00a0So he told his younger daughter and son they were going to take a trip: a two-hour drive to Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., where, for the first time in his life, Buchalter would join a protest. \u201cThis is not what we fought for, having been in Iraq\u00a0and working with these interpreters,\u201d Buchalter said in a phone interview Sunday. When he saw an Iraqi family emerge from detention, he presented them with something he hoped would convey America\u2019s goodwill \u2014\u00a0a Purple Heart. \u201cKnowing their culture and how they view America, for me, it was a way to send a message to them:\u00a0What they believe America was, it is,\u201d Buchalter said. \u201cIt's the greatest place in the world.\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order Friday to block travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations triggered confusion, fear and anger\u00a0around the nation as protesters and attorneys gathered at airports to try to force the release of at least dozens of travelers who had unexpectedly become detainees. Many of America\u2019s veterans were among those frustrated by the order, inspired largely by the story of Iraqi interpreter Hameed Khalid\u00a0Darweesh. Darweesh, 53, was detained after arriving\u00a0at John F. Kennedy International Airport\u00a0in New York, despite holding a\u00a0special immigrant visa granted to American military translators following a decade of what one U.S. official had deemed \u201cfaithful and valuable service to the United States\u201d in Iraq, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Darweesh\u00a0had worked for the U.S.\u00a0as an interpreter, engineer and contractor from 2003 to 2013, continuing even as Iraqi colleagues were assassinated for their work supporting the American invasion. Now he wanted to immigrate to the U.S. It\u00a0had taken Darweesh two years of interviews and security screenings to obtain the visa, but, for the moment, all that appeared to be suddenly worthless. Veterans were infuriated by his story. \u201cThe idea that we would be detaining Iraqi interpreters who put their lives on the line to help troops like myself in Iraq is disagraceful,\u201d wrote veteran\u00a0Jon Soltz, chairman of an Iraq\u00a0veterans\u2019 political action committee, VoteVets. The group launched a petition calling on Trump to rescind the visa restrictions and to provide aid for U.S. military interpreters. Those frustrated by Darweesh\u2019s treatment included one of his\u00a0former American colleagues in the 101st Airborne division, Brandon Friedman, who had met Darweesh as an infantry lieutenant when the division swept into Baghdad to drive out\u00a0the forces of Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein. \u201cHe was anti-Saddam and wanted to help us,\u201d said Friedman, who would go on to work in the Obama administration, recalling how Darweesh accompanied platoons on dangerous missions. \u201cThe guy was absolutely fearless. Guys in our company would go out in all the body armor and everything, and he would go out in khakis and a baseball cap, at least in the beginning.\u201d Not only was Darweesh\u2019s\u00a0work essential for soldiers to navigate Iraqi communities, but when a car bomb detonated near the unit\u2019s base,\u00a0\u201cHe was wounded himself, and he pulled wounded soldiers to safety,\u201d Friedman said. And now veterans who knew Darweesh were upset. \u201cIf you could see all the Facebook posts from guys in the unit this week, everybody loved him. He was just such an integral part of the unit,\u201d Friedman said.\u00a0Many veterans were \u201cabsolutely\u201d opposed to Trump\u2019s blanket exclusion of\u00a0military interpreters,\u00a0\u201cbecause if you've been over there, you know their importance,\u201d said Friedman. He called the ban \u201cdeplorable\u201d and said it gives interpreters less incentive to help U.S. troops in the future. As public scrutiny grew Saturday, protesters and immigration attorneys massed at airports around the nation, and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Darweesh\u2019s behalf. Darweesh was freed earlier in the day, and his ACLU lawsuit\u00a0later led to a late-night ruling from a federal judge in New York, who temporarily\u00a0barred American officials from deporting arriving travelers who otherwise had legal travel documents. But the executive order still makes life uncertain for other Muslims abroad who had assisted the American military and whose hopes for entry to the U.S. have dimmed. Chase Millsap, a former Marine infantry officer who served multiple tours in Iraq, has been trying to help a former Iraqi soldier he served with to gain asylum in the U.S. The Iraqi man, whose name Millsap asked be withheld for his safety, fled with his family to southern Turkey in 2014, after Islamic State militants reached the outskirts of Baghdad and began hunting for the soldier\u2019s Shiite family, Millsap said. The soldier, whom Millsap nicknamed \u201cthe Captain,\u201d applied for refugee status through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services but has been waiting for a decision for nearly three years. \u201cThis ban sets the clock back even further \u2014 at least 120 days, and after that who knows if they\u2019re going to pick it back up,\u201d said Millsap, now a writer and filmmaker in Los Angeles. On Friday, after Trump signed the order, Millsap called his friend in Turkey and broke the news. The Iraqi man, who has a wife and two children, and also supports his sister and her three kids, had been taking English classes in anticipation of being allowed to immigrate to the U.S. \u201cFor me, it was a punch to the gut,\u201d Millsap said. \u201cI had to tell him we\u2019ve left him behind and we\u2019re not going to step up and do the right thing, at least right now. \u201cFor him, it was really sad. I could tell the frustration in his voice.\u201d Millsap said he had been heartened by the ad hoc coalition of lawyers, human rights advocates and veterans from all branches of the military that was speaking up on behalf of Iraqis and others affected by Trump\u2019s ban. \u201cThis is very apolitical,\u201d Millsap said. \u201cThese are people who served directly alongside of us. For us, it\u2019s very simple to say we need to help them. A lot of these guys are directly under threat and going underground. Let\u2019s make sure they have a path to safety.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Have the women\u2019s marches started a movement? \u00a0 In the presidential election, just seven of L.A.\u2019s 1,700 precincts went for Trump. \u00a0 In a fiery State of the State, Brown returned to a familiar conclusion. \u00a0 Prosecutors believed two officers feared for their lives when they fatally shot Ezell Ford in 2014. \u00a0 'La La Land' danced its way to 14 Oscar nominations. \u00a0 Mary Tyler Moore \u00a0was a beloved TV icon who symbolized the independent career woman.\u00a0Chinese New Year begins this weekend.

    "text": "Trump's Immigration Order Sparks Protests at Airports Nationwide By JULIA JACOBO Jan 29, 2017, 5:05 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Protests Build Across the Country Against Trump's Immigration Order 0 Shares Email Protests erupted at airports nationwide Saturday following the implementation of President Donald Trump 's executive order placing temporary bans on entry into the U.S. of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. With 375 travelers affected so far by the travel ban as of Saturday night, according to the Department of Homeland Security -- some being sent back to their originating countries from airports across the U.S., and others being prevented from boarding U.S.-bound flights overseas -- hundreds of people descended upon airports to express support for those affected by the ban and to express disdain for Trump and the executive order. Additional protests are scheduled for Sunday, as well, at airports across the country. Below, a rundown of protests that occurred at U.S. airports on Saturday: PORTLAND, OREGON Light rail service at Portland International Airport was briefly disrupted by a protest consisting of several dozen people. Many of the protesters chanted and carried signs that read \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban, no wall, America is for us all.\" Oregonians protest Trump's ban on refugees at Portland airport! #NoBanNoWall #pdxprotest pic.twitter.com/6VIh4HKsWP \u2014 ACLU of Oregon (@ACLU_OR) January 29, 2017 NEW YORK, NEW YORK More than 2,000 people descended upon John F. Kennedy International Airport, where 12 refugees were detained. The scene was so chaotic that the Port Authority shut down the public transportation to the airport in an attempt to restore order, but New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reversed the Port Authority's decision. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said in a statement. I have ordered the Port Authority to reverse its decision regarding the JFK AirTrain. The people of New York will have their voices heard. pic.twitter.com/zwGOYgzQPg \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) January 29, 2017 The New York Taxi Workers Alliance joined the protest and called for an hour-long work stoppage with no taxi pickups or drop-offs at the airport, ABC affiliate WABC reported. During the protests, a Muslim family handed out free coffee as a sign of solidarity. People passed out slices of pizza to protesters, as well. A video posted by @sarah2rue on Jan 28, 2017 at 11:23am PST PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA Dozens protested outside of Philadelphia International Airport after two Syrian families were detained and then placed on flights back home, ABC affiliate WPVI reported. The crowd included Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, Sen. Bob Casey , Congressman Bob Brady and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, according to WPVI. CHICAGO , ILLINOIS Hundreds of protesters converged upon Terminal 5 at O'Hare International Airport, calling for the release of 13 people who were being detained there, ABC affiliate WLS reported. At least one passenger -- a Syrian woman -- was detained after arriving from Saudi Arabia, WLS reported. She was sent back, according to WLS. The woman's sister told WLS that she felt \"hopeless\" and that there was \"nothing\" she could do.
