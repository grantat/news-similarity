Matt Stevens Continued rain and snow across California has lifted nearly\u00a0half of the state out of drought, according to an analysis released Thursday.\u00a0 Just over\u00a051% of California remains in \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cextreme\u201d drought, the U.S. Drought Monitor \u00a0reported. By comparison, more than 95% of the state was listed as being in some form of drought\u00a0a year ago. And in another positive development, none of the state was listed as being in \u201cexceptional drought\u201d \u2014\u00a0a condition that had affected portions of Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Kern counties as recently as a month ago. \u00a0 Perhaps the most striking change to the color-coded\u00a0map was the near disappearance of bright red, which signifies \"extreme drought.\" The map showed only 2% of the state as being in extreme drought Thursday, compared with nearly\u00a0a quarter of the state just a week ago. Since California\u2019s \u201cwater year\u201d began in October with above-average precipitation, the state has enjoyed continued wet weather that has gradually improved its drought outlook. The weekly release of the U.S. Drought Monitor map has largely reflected those improvements, with perhaps the biggest shift coming two weeks ago , when almost all of Northern California was declared not only to be out of drought, but also to be showing no signs of \u201cabnormal dryness.\u201d\u00a0 Caption Seal Beach flooding Flooding along the boardwalk in Seal Beach after rainfall and high surf.

As a series of storms have hit Northern California this winter, the drought picture there is improving. Thursday\u2019s map showed that almost 39% of California \u2014\u00a0mostly regions north of the Bay Area \u2014\u00a0lacked any\u00a0signs of abnormal dryness.\u00a0 Drought conditions persisted, however,\u00a0for much of the the Central Coast and Central Valley, where water shortages have been most acute over the past five years.\u00a0 But\u00a0as the U.S. Drought Monitor has garnered increased attention,\u00a0water officials from various state agencies have questioned its merits. In a recent interview, Jeanine Jones, Interstate Resources Manager for the Department of Water Resources,\u00a0noted that the product was originally developed to characterize drought conditions at a national scale. Though it has evolved over the years, it remains a subjective blend\u00a0of information that captures a \u201csnapshot of drought at a moment in time,\u201d she said. The report\u2019s weekly time step is also \u201cmisleading in California,\u201d where dry spells can last throughout a summer, Jones said. And unlike Nebraska, where the tool was developed, California has many surface-water projects that move the resource\u00a0long distances;\u00a0water managers pump groundwater and many rely on recycled water for supply.\u00a0 \u201cAll those conditions don\u2019t necessarily imply that if it didn\u2019t rain for a week, you\u2019re in a drought,\u201d Jones said. She noted that although the U.S. Department of Agriculture uses the drought monitor as a\u00a0trigger for drought-related financial\u00a0assistance, \u201cit\u2019s not something a water agency would use to manage.\u201d ",

President Obama used his pen and phone to exceed his powers in our perspective. Everything Obama did by executive order, this president can undo,\" Ryan said, arguing that Trump could also use executive orders to overcome barriers they've encountered in the past when attempting to build a wall on the Southern border. During Obama's term, the House Judiciary Committee went as far as to form a task force to probe executive authority accusing \"presidents of both parties\" of \"legislating from the Oval Office,\" but acknowledged its focus was Obama. Rep. Steve King, who heads up the House Judiciary subcommittee on executive authority, declined through a spokesman to comment on Trump's use of executive order. The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Steve Cohen said he doubted the committee would act on Trump's executive orders right now. \"They'll probably push it down,\" Cohen told NBC News. \"It will be a test to see if they're consistent with their philosophy.\" Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said Obama had \"exceeded his executive authority\" and was acting \"without legal authority\" in 2014, following Obama's immigration executive orders. On Wednesday, he released a statement of support after Trump used an executive order to begin constructing a border wall. \"I welcome President Trump's focus on these problems and look forward to reviewing today's executive orders and working with the administration to accomplish our shared goals,\" he said.

Morgan was named to the post in June and took office in October. The former FBI agent briefly led the internal affairs department at the Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency before heading the agency of roughly 20,000 agents. Morgan leaves office only seven months after being named the first outsider to lead the agency since it was founded in 1924. Mexico's president cancels meeting with Trump From the start, he clashed with the Border Patrol\u2019s union, which endorsed Mr. Trump early and forcefully during the presidential campaign. The National Border Patrol Council had advocated for an insider to lead the agency and sharply criticized Morgan at almost every turn. A former official told The Associated Press Morgan was not at work Wednesday and did not attend a gathering at the Homeland Security Department with Mr. Trump and newly appointed Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. During that visit Mr. Trump singled out the union\u2019s president, Brandon Judd, while pointedly avoiding mention of Morgan. Judd served on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team. Trump unveils executive orders on immigration, border wall The union was incensed when Morgan told a Senate hearing Dec. 1, in response to a question from Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., that he supported a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which is often interpreted to include a path to citizenship for people who are in the country illegally. Morgan clarified his remarks in a note to Border Patrol staff the following week. \u201cI want to be clear what my position is regarding immigration reform,\u201d Morgan wrote. \u201cI do not, as some have suggested, support what is often referred to as \u2018blanket amnesty.\u2019 This assertion could not be further from my position. I encourage everyone to listen to my testimony.\u201d Despite pressure from the union, many agency officials said Morgan appeared to embrace the job. Less than a week ago, the first message on his new Twitter account read, \u201cChief Morgan here -- excited to use this account to share the latest news and events of the #BorderPatrol with followers.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Trump said he believed \"torture works\" during the campaign, but on Wednesday he made his first detailed comments on the matter as president, having sworn to uphold the Constitution and the law. Asked by ABC News' David Muir if he would say the U.S. doesn't torture, Trump declined. The president said he would defer to his foreign policy advisers about what interrogation techniques to use, and said he wants to do \"everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally.\" But then, asked about his comments during the campaign that he supports \"waterboarding and a hell of a lot worse,\" Trump said, \"I would do, I would do \u2014 I want to keep our country safe.\" He added that if his advisers want to reinstate the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding, \"then I will work for that end [because] I think it works.\" Play British PM 'Not Afraid to Speak Frankly' to President Trump 1:16 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170126233856if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/862493251952\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump's remarks stunned even some of the architects of the CIA's post 9/11 interrogation program. \"The whole premise of the original program was that the techniques did not fit the legal definition of torture,\" John Rizzo, who was acting CIA general counsel, said on MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports. Torture \"was illegal then, and it's illegal now\u2026 So to hear the President of the United States use that word in an affirmative way \u2014 I found that remarkable.\" John Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer who wrote some of the secret memos about the CIA program, told NBC News that Trump \"is not being legally careful.\" Rizzo, Yoo and their former colleagues, including President George W. Bush, argue that waterboarding, sleep deprivation, stress positions, confinement to small boxes and other techniques the CIA employed did not constitute illegal \"torture,\" because of memos by Yoo and other Justice Department officials saying so. Those memos have since been widely repudiated. The U.S. prosecuted Japanese war criminals after World War II who had inflicted something very much like waterboarding on American troops. A Senate report in 2014, though it didn't use the word torture, made clear that the CIA techniques inflicted serious pain and suffering, to the point that some CIA officers openly wept as they watched them applied.

Trump \"has taken the veil off of this, as he has with so many things,\" said Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University. \"This is not a president who is going to pretend we're going to do one thing and say another.\" However, Greenberg said, his remarks show that he \"is either not concerned about, or doesn't understand, issues of recriminations and the blowback that can occur with such policies.\" Torture is illegal under the framework of international law that the U.S. helped put in place after World War II. Specifically, the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 5 states: \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\" Torture is also illegal under American law, and that was the case long before Congress codified President Obama's interrogation rules last year. Specifically, 18 USC Chapter 113C makes it a crime to commit torture outside of the United States. That law was enacted in 1994 to comply with international law. Domestic statutes have long made torture a crime. \"The world has taken torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment off the table, through binding international prohibitions that we have signed and ratified,\" said David Cole, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The idea that the Trump administration is considering doubling down on these discredited policies is deeply disturbing.\" Yoo offered a different view, arguing that a draft executive order that emerged Wednesday on detention and interrogation was rather modest. It called for studying whether to resume allowing the CIA to capture terrorists abroad and use enhanced techniques in interrogations. \"The broader political story is it's putting our opponents on notice that they are not going to keep punching at us and nothing is going to happen back,\" Yoo said.

But President Enrique Pena Nieto, while he did not directly mention the trip in a speech late Wednesday, appeared not to rule out going. He said he would await reports from the high-level team of Mexican officials currently meeting with Trump administration officials in Washington. \u201cBased on the final report from the Mexican officials who are in Washington right now ... I will make decisions about what to do next,\u201d Pena Nieto said. President Trump signed orders related to his campaign promises, including ending the \"catch-and-release\" policy and building a border wall. Washi... Pena Nieto said he regrets and condemns the decision to build the wall, saying \u201cI have said time and time again, Mexico will not pay for any wall.\u201d He said he had issued an order to designate the 50 Mexican consulates in the U.S. as defense centers to protect the rights of Mexican naitonals in the U.S. \u201cMexico offers and demands respect,\u201d he said. But Pena Nieto held out an olive branch, saying \u201cMexico re-affirms its friendship with the people of the United States, and its willingness to reach agreements with its government.\u201d The decision to possibly rethink the visit comes amid growing outrage in Mexico, and a sense among many that Pena Nieto has been too weak in the face of Trump\u2019s tough policy stance. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press the administration \u201cis considering\u201d scrapping the Jan. 31 visit. \u201cThat\u2019s what I can tell you.\u201d It was not clear when a final decision may be made. President Trump signed sweeping new directives targeting undocumented migrants.CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid has the latest on how the pre... Trump\u2019s order came the same day Mexico\u2019s foreign relations and economy secretaries arrived in Washington for talks with his administration, and its timing was seen by many in Mexico as a slap in the face. Critics of Pena Nieto - whose approval ratings were just 12 percent in a recent survey, the lowest for any Mexican president in the polling era - have hammered him for his perceived weakness on Trump. Opposition politicians urged him Wednesday to call off the trip. \u201cThe position is very clear,\u201d said Ricardo Anaya Cortes, president of the conservative opposition National Action Party. \u201cEither one cancels the meeting with Donald Trump, or one attends it to say publicly and with absolute firmness that Mexico rejects the wall and we will not pay a single cent for it.\u201d Trump has vowed to force Mexico to pay for the wall, and also to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Pena Nieto and other officials have repeatedly said Mexico will not pay. Analyst Jorge Zepeda Patterson argued that Pena Nieto should keep the meeting as scheduled, saying Mexico should exhaust all possibilities for negotiating to minimize damage. He said Pena Nieto should try to reach an agreement that\u2019s enough to let Trump claim victory and then move on to another foil. \u201cTrump is more interested in boasting of an immediate success than an ambitious result. He is interested in appearances,\u201d Zepeda said. The U.S. president has also promised to step up deportations. He launched his campaign with remarks calling immigrants crossing in illegally from Mexico criminals, drug dealers and \u201crapists.\u201d Trump added that \u201csome\u201d were presumably good people, but the comments nonetheless deeply offended many Mexicans. Pena Nieto was roundly criticized after inviting candidate Trump to Mexico City last August and disappointed many of his countrymen by not publicly confronting Trump on the wall. On Tuesday, ahead of their trip to Washington, the economy and foreign relations secretaries suggested that Mexico could leave NAFTA if negotiations with Washington are unsatisfactory - though that would not be the first choice. Already Mexico is feeling the effects of the new tone from Washington. The Mexican peso has sharply devalued since Trump was elected, and several high-profile business ventures have been canceled amid threats to impose a border tax on goods made in Mexico and exported to the United States. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Mark Morgan, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, has resigned after only six months on the job, one day after President Donald Trump announced plans to ratchet up immigration enforcement and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, officials said Jan. 26, 2017. (Donna Burton / U.S. Customs and Border Protection) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The man charged with protecting America's borders was ousted Thursday, one day after President Donald Trump announced ambitious plans to build a massive wall at the Mexican border and bolster the ranks of the Border Patrol. Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan said he was asked to leave and decided to resign rather than fight the request, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the brief video conference in which Morgan informed senior agents of the change. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussion was not intended to be made public. The forced resignation leaves Trump with a leadership gap but also gives him a chance to start fresh with a Border Patrol chief of his own choosing. Border security and a \"big beautiful wall\" paid for by the Mexican government were centerpieces of Trump's immigration platform during his presidential campaign. Mexico has repeatedly said it won't pay for a barrier, and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto on Thursday cancelled a meeting with Trump. Morgan was named to the post in June and took office in October. The former FBI agent briefly led the internal affairs department at the Border Patrol's parent agency before heading the agency of roughly 20,000 agents. Gil Kerlikowske , who hired Morgan when he was commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said he wasn't surprised about the leadership change and added: \"I have nothing but good and positive things to say about him.\" Border wall Julie Watson / AP People pass graffiti along the border structure in Tijuana, Mexico, on Jan. 25, 2017. President Donald Trump moved aggressively to tighten the nation's immigration controls Wednesday, signing executive actions to jumpstart construction of his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall and cut federal grants for immigrant-protecting \"sanctuary cities.\" People pass graffiti along the border structure in Tijuana, Mexico, on Jan. 25, 2017. President Donald Trump moved aggressively to tighten the nation's immigration controls Wednesday, signing executive actions to jumpstart construction of his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall and cut federal grants for immigrant-protecting \"sanctuary cities.\" (Julie Watson / AP) From the start, Morgan clashed with the Border Patrol's union, which had advocated for an insider to lead the agency and sharply criticized Morgan at almost every turn. The union was incensed when Morgan, at a Senate hearing Dec. 1, said he supported a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which is often interpreted to include a path to citizenship for people who are in the country illegally. Morgan clarified his remarks in a note to Border Patrol staff the following week, saying he does not support a \"blanket amnesty.\" The union, the National Border Patrol Council, has had a strong relationship with Trump. It was so enamored with his stance on security that it took the unusual step of endorsing him during the campaign. The endorsement was a leadership decision and not decided on by a unionwide vote. Union chief Brandon Judd was part of Trump's transition team. \"He didn't know the job to begin with,\" Judd said in an interview with the AP last week. \"He had to go on a tour of all the Border Patrol sectors to get an understanding. We needed a chief to hit the ground running.\" When Trump visited the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday, he singled out Judd while pointedly avoiding mention of Morgan. Morgan was not at the event. Despite pressure from the union, many agency officials said Morgan appeared to embrace the job. Less than a week ago, the first message on his new Twitter account read, \"Chief Morgan here \u2014 excited to use this account to share the latest news and events of the #BorderPatrol with followers.\" Deputy Chief Carla Provost, who has been with the agency since 1995, will be the agency's acting chief, according to an internal memo to agents in the Border Patrol's Tucson office that was obtained by the AP. Morgan's ouster occurred amid a shakeup across the agencies of government. The State Department on Thursday said several senior management officials as well as a top arms control diplomat would be leaving. All had submitted resignations before Trump became president as required of officials holding president-appointed jobs. But they weren't required to leave the foreign service. Associated Press ",

The mere fact of it being untrue? Or the fact that it\u2019s bogus, baseless or groundless?\u201d Some news organizations used words like \u201cfalsely\u201d or \u201cwrongly\u201d \u2014 adverbs that tend to weaken the impact \u2014 in framing what the president said. Some used \u201cwith no evidence,\u201d or \u201cwon\u2019t provide any proof,\u201d or \u201cunverified claims,\u201d or \u201crepeats debunked claim.\u201d The New York Times, though, ultimately chose more muscular terminology, opting to use the word \u201clie\u201d in the headline. After initially using the word \u201cfalsely,\u201d it switched to \u201clie\u201d online and then settled on \u201cMeeting With Top Lawmakers, Trump Repeats an Election Lie\u201d for Tuesday\u2019s print edition. People noticed, and debated its use. That is because, from the childhood schoolyard to the grave, this is a word neither used nor taken lightly. It stands apart from most other terms in the linguistic ballpark of untruths, including \u201cfalsehood,\u201d which Chuck Todd, the host of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d recently used to counter the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway\u2019s Orwellian phrase, \u201calternative facts.\u201d To say that someone has \u201clied,\u201d an active verb, or has told a \u201clie,\u201d a more passive, distancing noun, is to say that the person intended to deceive. In addition, Mr. Nunberg said, \u201ca certain moral opprobrium attaches to it, a reprehensibility of motive.\u201d The question of intent has informed National Public Radio\u2019s approach to covering Mr. Trump\u2019s many disputable claims: that he saw thousands of people in Jersey City cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed on Sept. 11, for example, or that the news media had made up a feud between him and the country\u2019s intelligence agencies, despite his own tweets likening those agencies to Nazi Germany. On NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition\u201d on Wednesday, Mary Louise Kelly explained that she had looked up the definition of \u201clie\u201d in the Oxford English Dictionary. \u201cA false statement made with intent to deceive,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cIntent being the key word there. Without the ability to peer into Donald Trump\u2019s head, I can\u2019t tell you what his intent was. I can tell you what he said and how that squares, or doesn\u2019t, with facts.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Michael Oreskes, NPR\u2019s senior president for news, supported the decision. In an article on the NPR website, Mr. Oreskes said that \u201cthe minute you start branding things with a word like \u2018lie,\u2019 you push people away from you.\u201d The inherent risk, he suggested, was that news organizations would be seen as taking sides.

The hull of the submarine, known as Juliett 484, rests mere feet from the shore in Providence. After the Cold War, the sub was sold and used as a restaurant and vodka bar in Helsinki, Finland, and as a set for the 2002 Ford movie \"K-19: The Widowmaker.\" Then it became a floating museum. It sank during a nor'easter in 2007 and was sold for scrap. State environmental officials sued to get it and several other vessels removed. A Superior Court judge ordered Rhode Island Recycled Metals LLC in December to begin removing vessels from the river, adjacent to its scrapyard. The permitting process is underway. The company was supposed to apply for permits by Jan. 15 for removing the first vessel. Those permits haven't been issued yet, according to Richard Land, appointed by the court to oversee the cleanup. Land said the deadline turned out to be far too aggressive, but the parties are making good-faith efforts. An amended court order submitted Thursday extends the deadline by two months. The 282-foot-long sub and a U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Saratoga, shadowed each other during the Cold War. The sub wound up in Providence because the Rhode Island-based USS Saratoga Museum Foundation bought it and opened it to the public as a floating museum in 2002. Both the scrapyard and the property owner, AARE LLC, are named in the lawsuit. The scrapyard has been ordered to deposit $300,000 in an escrow account to pay for removing the vessels. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard are among the agencies that have to approve the plans. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Jan 26 2017, 4:43 pm ET Drifter Bob Evans Eyed as Serial Killer, Tied to N.H. Murders by Tracy Connor advertisement A \"chameleon\" who died in prison while serving time for murdering his wife has now been tied to the 1981 disappearance of a New Hampshire woman and the bodies of a woman and three children \u2014 one of them his own daughter \u2014 who were found in barrels in the woods. Denise Beaudin disappeared with her infant daughter and boyfriend, Robert Evans, seen here, in 1981. via NBC Boston \"We believe we have our killer,\" said New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Strelzin. \"Now we need to identify and try to find all of his victims.\" He said the suspect, known as Bob Evans and a slew of other aliases, \"certainly fits the profile of a serial killer\" and that investigators are concerned he may have murdered others they don't know about. Investigators said they followed a convoluted forensic trail to tie the cases to Evans, a hard-drinking drifter who allegedly beat his victims to death and dismembered some of them: They believe he murdered girlfriend Denise Beaudin, a 23-year-old Manchester, New Hampshire, woman last seen in 1981. They suspect he killed her somewhere between New Hampshire and California and kept her infant daughter, named Dawn at birth, for several years before abandoning her in a California RV park in 1986. The girl, whom he renamed Lisa, was later adopted and is alive and well. They believe that as early as 1980, he killed four victims whose bodies were found in industrial drums in Allenstown, New Hampshire. The remains of a woman in her mid-20s and a girl about age 11 were not found until 1985, and the bodies of two girls, one about 4 and one about 3, were found in another container in 2000. He is the father of the middle child, and police believe her mother, who has not been identified, may have been killed as well. He admitted killing and dismembering California chemist Eunsoon Jun, 45, soon after marrying her in a backyard ceremony in California in 2002 and was serving a 15-year sentence when he died in prison in 2010. While much about Evans' identity and activities was murky, authorities knew one thing: His DNA showed he was not the biological father of the little girl he abandoned in the RV park, but he would not say where he got the child. Denise Beaudin disappeared in New Hampshire in 1981. via NBC Boston In 2014, California police enlisted DNA and genetics experts to figure out Lisa's real identity. And last year, they came up with a hit, finding a cousin in Hampshire and then determining that she was the daughter of long-missing Denise Baudin. Police had long wondered if the Baudin case might be linked to the other big unsolved mystery in the area from the era. They compared Evans' DNA to the genetic profiles of the victims in the barrels and found he is the father of one of the dead girls. (The woman and the other two children are related to each other, possibly mother and child, but are not related to Evans). Police also amassed circumstantial evidence linking Evans to the bodies. While employed as an electrician at a local mill, he had worked under the man who owned the property where the remains were dumped, and the barrels were likely from the mill. Even though police believe they have figured out who is responsible for Beaudin's disappearance and the bodies in the barrels, they have many unanswered questions and asked that anyone with information about Evans contact them. Bob Evans pleaded guilty to murdering Eunsoon Jun in 2002. New Hampshire State Police Because he changed his name and birth date so often, they are not even certain of his true identity, though they think he may have a military background. And they fear he may have more blood on his hands. They noted that when he was arrested on drunken-driving charges in February and June 1980, he told police he had a wife named Elizabeth. When he was arrested again in October 1980, he did not list a wife. Police later found certified mail signed for by an Elizabeth Evans at his Manchester home, but they have not been able to find any trace of her. There is also a worryingly long gap in their timeline of his travels in California. After serving 18 months in a drunken-driving hit-and-run case, he absconded from parole in 1990 and was a fugitive until he resurfaced in Richmond, California, where he met and married Jun. \"Given what we know about him, we are concerned about his activities in California for those 12 years,\" Strelzin said. \"This is somebody who targets females, and children as well. We know he is an abuser,\" Strelzin said, adding that Evans may have used Lisa and potentially other children as bait to meet women. \"This is a guy who was a chameleon.\" Police now say they believe Bob Evans killed a woman and three children found in barrels in the woods in 1985 and 2000. New Hampshire State Police Beaudin's body has not been found and investigators are not sure where she may have been killed. Her daughter, who doesn't have any strong memories of Beaudin, said in a statement that she is grateful for the work police have done but pleaded for privacy for her, her husband and three children. \"Please turn your focus toward the unidentified victims, and other potentially unknown victims in this case, and hopefully their families will also be offered some closure as this investigation continues,\" she wrote. Officials said that while it's a relief that they know more about what happened to the New Hampshire victims, it's disappointing the suspect is not alive to fill in the blanks \u2014 and be prosecuted. \"He will never face true justice for what he did,\" Strelzin said.

The photo at left and the screengrab from video on the right were both shot shortly before noon from the top of the Washington Monument. This pair of photos shows a view of the crowd on the National Mall at the inaugurations of President Barack Obama, left on Jan. 20, 2009, and President Donald Trump, right, on Jan. 20, 2017. The photo at left and the screengrab from video on the right were both shot shortly before noon from the top of the Washington Monument. (Associated Press) Karen Tumulty, Juliet EilperinThe Washington Post On the morning after Donald Trump 's inauguration, acting National Park Service director Michael Reynolds received an extraordinary summons: The new president wanted to talk to him. In a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day's crowds on the National Mall, according to three individuals who have knowledge of the conversation. The president believed that they might prove that the media had lied in reporting that attendance had been no better than average. Trump also expressed anger over a retweet sent from the agency's account, in which side-by-side photographs showed far fewer people at his swearing-in than had shown up to see Barack Obama 's inaugural in 2009. According to one account, Reynolds had been contacted by the White House and given a phone number to call. When he dialed it, he was told to hold for the president. Twitter accounts -- indefinitely -- after a National Park Service employee shared two tweets that noted President Donald Trump 's relatively small inaugural crowds compared to the numbers former president Barack Obama drew in 2009. ... The Interior Department was ordered Friday to shut down its official Twitter accounts -- indefinitely -- after a National Park Service employee shared two tweets that noted President Donald Trump 's relatively small inaugural crowds compared to the numbers former president Barack Obama drew in 2009. ... (Lisa Rein) For Trump, who sees himself and his achievements in superlative terms, the inauguration's crowd size has been a source of grievance that he appears unable to put behind him. It is a measure of his fixation on the issue that he would devote part of his first morning in office to it - and that he would take out his frustrations on an acting Park Service director. Word rapidly spread through the agency and Washington. The individuals who informed The Washington Post about the call declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the conversation. Neither Reynolds nor the Park Service would talk about it. \"The National Park Service does not comment on internal conversations among administration officials,\" agency spokesman Thomas Crosson said. White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the call simply demonstrated that Trump's management style is to be \"so accessible, and constantly in touch.\" \"He's not somebody who sits around and waits. He takes action and gets things done,\" Sanders said. \"That's one of the reasons that he is president today, and Hillary Clinton isn't.\" On Saturday, the same day Trump spoke with Reynolds, the new president used an appearance at CIA headquarters to deliver a blistering attack on the media for reporting that large swaths of the Mall were nearly empty during the event. \"It's a lie,\" Trump said. \"We caught [the media]. We caught them in a beauty.\" \"It looked like a million, a million and a half people,\" Trump said, vastly inflating what the available evidence suggested. Later that day, White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated Trump's complaints about media coverage of the crowd in a tongue-lashing from the lectern of the briefing room. \"These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\" Spicer said. The Park Service does not release crowd estimates. Experts, however, have estimated that the 2017 turnout was no more than a third the size of Obama's eight years earlier. Reynolds was taken aback by Trump's request, but did secure some additional aerial photographs and forwarded them to the White House through normal channels in the Interior Department, the sources said. The photos, however, did not prove Trump's contention that the crowd size was upwards of 1 million. Reynolds, who had served as the Park Service's deputy director of operations for six months before assuming the post of acting director, is a third-generation employee who has worked there for more than 30 years. As deputy director, he oversaw the Service's $2.8 billion budget and more than 22,000 employees. In the days since Trump's election, the Park Service has become an unlikely protagonist in a battle between the new president and some career government employees. The trouble began late Friday, when the agency's official Twitter account retweeted two tweets that could be perceived as critical of the new administration: the one comparing the relative crowd size for Trump's inaugural to that of Obama's 2009 swearing-in, and another that noted policy pages that had been removed from the White House's website. That prompted an \"urgent directive\" to Interior employees that they \"shut down Twitter platforms immediately until further notice,\" which was lifted early Saturday morning. Crosson then apologized on Twitter for \"mistaken RTs from our account.\" ",

Bernhard Langer of Germany walks off the tee box on the third hole during the final round of the 3M Championship at TPC Twin Cities on Aug. 3, 2014, in Blaine, Minn. (Steve Dykes / Getty Images) Des BielerThe Washington Post The odd story of how a German professional golfer came to be mentioned by President Donald Trump in a discussion of his desire for a \"major investigation\" into voter fraud turned a little more odd Thursday when the golfer denied the tale told by the president. At issue is a Wednesday New York Times story about Trump's remarks at a bipartisan luncheon held Monday. He repeated his claim, an unfounded assertion with little evidence to support it, that he would have won the popular vote were it not for 3 million to 5 million illegal ballots that he alleges were cast for Hillary Clinton . When challenged on that assertion by a Democrat attending the luncheon, Trump relayed a story he said he was told by a friend, \"the very famous golfer, Bernhard Langer.\" The two-time Masters winner, now a fixture on the PGA's Champions Tour, had a frustrating experience when trying to vote near his Florida home on Election Day, according to the president. Langer was told while standing in line that he would not be able to vote, Trump said, but what Trump did not mention was that Langer is not a U.S. citizen. That was confirmed to the Times' Glenn Thrush by the 59-year-old golfer's daughter, Christina Langer, who graduated from Florida Atlantic last year after spending four years on the school's golf team, and by Langer himself Thursday. Citing staff members who also attended the luncheon, the Times reported that Trump said part of Langer's frustration was that \"ahead of and behind [him in line] were voters who did not look as if they should be allowed to vote.\" Trump \"threw out the names of Latin American countries that the voters might have come from,\" according to the newspaper, which noted that a White House official \"contradicted\" that version of the depicted events. In a statement via Golf Digest, Langer said the story had passed through several people. \"Unfortunately, the report in the New York Times and other news outlets was a mischaracterization by the media. The voting situation reported was not conveyed from me to President Trump but rather was told to me by a friend,\" he said. On Wednesday, the New York Times published a story about President Donald Trump 's remarks at a bipartisan luncheon held Monday. He repeated... What does a decorated German golfer have to do with a \"major investigation\" into voter fraud sought by the U.S. president? Much more than one might expect. On Wednesday, the New York Times published a story about President Donald Trump 's remarks at a bipartisan luncheon held Monday. He repeated... (Des Bieler) \"I then relayed the story in conversation with another friend, who shared it with a person with ties to the White House. From there, this was misconstrued. I am not a citizen of the United States and cannot vote. It's a privilege to live in the United States and I am blessed to call America my home. I will have no further comment at this time.\" Langer's daughter had told the Times that her father is \"not a friend of President Trump's, and I don't know why he would talk about him.\" From the newspaper's account: \"A senior White House staff member, who was not at the Monday reception but has heard Mr. Trump tell the story, said Mr. Langer saw Mr. Trump in Florida during the Thanksgiving break and told him the story of a friend of Mr. Langer's who had been blocked from voting. ... \"The story, the aide added, had made a big impression on Mr. Trump.\" Trump is an avid golfer and golf fan who owns numerous courses, including several that have hosted high-level professional tournaments. However, the PGA has moved its World Golf Championship, long held at Trump National Doral in Florida, to Mexico City, with the tour's commissioner, Tim Finchem, acknowledging last year that \"politics may have contributed some.\" Although there's been talk of moving the U.S. Women's Open from Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, it remains set to take place there next summer. Langer, a native of Bavaria, has 103 professional wins, including his 1985 and 1993 Masters victories. He has 30 wins on the Champions Tour, including one at the just-completed Mitsubishi Electric Championship in Hawaii, and is the tour's reigning player of the year. In 2014, Langer told reporters at the Allianz Championship, \"I am going to become an American citizen when I decide I want to or need to. I don't feel the need at this point. I pay my taxes here like every citizen here does. I still have a German passport. Why should I trade in my German passport for an American one when I can vote in Germany? Right now, I'm not sure I want to vote the way it is going. . . . At this point I do not see any necessity to do it. It doesn't mean I will not in the future. I have a green card, I pay my taxes. The only thing I cannot do is vote.\" ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Crumbling Pillars Ms. May has sought to win over Mr. Trump, whom she will visit this week, just as her European counterparts are exploring more fundamental questions about American reliability. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe British debate on Trump is over very trivial stuff, like who Trump spoke to before May, and the German debate is over the future of the liberal order in the West,\u201d said Mark Leonard, the director of the London-based European Council on Foreign Relations. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German foreign minister, wrote in a column this week for the German newspaper Bild that, with Mr. Trump\u2019s election, \u201cthe old world of the 20th century is gone\u201d and that Germany could confront drastic changes. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, said last month that Mr. Trump\u2019s election \u201copens a period of uncertainty.\u201d British leaders, Mr. Leonard said, have not accepted the view, growing in other European governments, \u201cthat our prosperity and security are based on an international architecture that\u2019s now being threatened.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an assumption that\u2019s all going to remain,\u201d he continued. Since Britain\u2019s decline from a global power in the years just after World War II, the country\u2019s foreign policy has rested on two pillars. First is the American-British partnership, which allows Britain to project its power and safeguard its interests globally. Second is European unity, which is essential for Britain\u2019s economic prosperity and, by removing the centuries-old diversions of European conflict, frees up Britain to act on the world stage. But both of those pillars could now be crumbling under the strain of European populism, Russian resurgence and particularly Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to step away from Europe. A Difficult Choice Britain\u2019s challenge is not just that each of those elements is coming under strain. Mr. Trump\u2019s avowed opposition to the European Union has put them in direct conflict. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For instance, Mr. Trump offered to reward Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union with a speedy trade deal. But this risks encouraging more exits from the bloc and possibly its disintegration. The resulting turmoil on the Continent, which includes several top British trading partners, could risk harming Britain\u2019s economy far more than an American trade deal would help. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed alignment with Russia poses a similar quandary. Germany and other leading European powers oppose such a realignment, which they fear would open the way for Russia to dominate Eastern Europe, breaking the Continent\u2019s unity on security matters. Ms. May remains hawkish on Russia. But it is unclear whether she would oppose Mr. Trump on the matter, particularly as she more fully ties her fate to the alliance. \u201cIf America eases up on Russia, Britain will be under heavy pressure to pick the United States, not to side with Merkel,\u201d said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a London-based think tank, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Ms. May is increasingly focused on maintaining the alliance with the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy and military power. Whereas leaders such as Ms. Merkel have responded sharply to criticism from Mr. Trump, Ms. May has been more forgiving. For example, she overlooked Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to meet with Nigel Farage, a former leader of the fringe U.K. Independence Party, before speaking with her. \u2018There Isn\u2019t a Plan B\u2019 Even if Ms. May succeeds in upholding the alliance, it is unclear that her government is preparing for the range of more seismic changes that Mr. Trump\u2019s election and other events could bring. Jeremy Shapiro, an American and the research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations, said he had struggled to convince British officials that the old order is \u201ceroding all around them.\u201d Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

    "text": "UK's May Praises Trump's 'Renewal' but Differs on Torture By jill lawless, associated press PHILADELPHIA \u0097 Jan 26, 2017, 4:48 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump's Promises Point to a Busy 'Day One' on Monday 0 Shares Email British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday embraced U.S. President Donald Trump as a friend and ally, but cautioned him not to turn his back on global institutions and long-established political values. On her first visit to the United States as prime minister, May called the start of Trump's term \"a new era of American renewal\" \u2014 but firmly rejected the president's suggestion that torture might be acceptable, and rebuffed some of his foreign-policy views. May flew to Philadelphia a day before she will hold talks with Trump at the White House and become the first foreign leader to meet the president since his inauguration. May worked hard to get the invitation, and is seizing the opportunity to bolster the trans-Atlantic \"special relationship\" and work toward a U.S.-U.K. free trade deal after Britain leaves the European Union. She told a gathering of Republican lawmakers at their annual Congressional retreat that a Britain outside the EU and the U.S. under Trump can \"lead together again\" in the world, as they did when they set up the United Nations , NATO and other international organizations the new president has strongly criticized. Throughout the more than half-hour of her speech, May declared sympathy for Trump's world view, then reminded the gathered Republicans \u2014 and by extension the president \u2014 of the United States' international obligations. She also joined in Trump's criticism of past U.S. foreign policy, saying \"the days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over.\" The comment could be read as a critique of military interventions in Iraq and Libya, and suggested an insular approach to the world that echoes Trump's \"America First\" stance. But May also said Britain was a strongly internationalist nation that supports a strong EU and considers NATO the bulwark of global security. May praised Trump's dedication to fighting violent Islamic extremism, but seemed to reject his suggestion for a ban on immigration by Muslims. She once called the idea \"divisive, stupid and wrong.\" \"We should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology, and the peaceful religion of Islam and the hundreds of millions of its adherents,\" she said at the Republican gathering. May acknowledged the need to work with Russia to end the war in Syria, but drew applause when she cautioned that the West's approach to President Vladimir Putin should be \"engage but beware.\" She spoke of Iran's \"malign influence,\" but praised the international deal that has limited its nuclear program. And she acknowledged fears about the rise of China, but said the growth of Asian economies \"is hugely welcome.\" Amid the foreign-policy suggestions, May wooed Republicans with an ode to the \"special relationship\" between the two countries. Her remarks were dotted with references to Winston Churchill, the Magna Carta and \u2014 of course \u2014 Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, a famously friendly Republican president and Conservative prime minister. May's carrot-and-stick approach to Trump is politically risky. She is under fire at home for seeking to get close to a president who has renewed his commitment to building a Mexican border wall, moved to pull the U.S. out of international trade treaties and said he thinks torturing terrorism suspects works. May told reporters aboard her Royal Air Force plane flying to the U.S. that \"we absolutely condemn the use of torture.\" Britain's official policy is to halt intelligence-sharing with countries that practice torture. May did not say what her government would do if the U.S. reinstated waterboarding, which has been called a form of torture and was banned under President Barack Obama. But she said, \"Our position has not changed.\" May said her talks with Trump in the Oval Office will focus on the fight against the Islamic State group, the future of NATO and Britain's desire for a quick trade deal. Not all leaders are as keen as May to meet Trump. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Thursday canceled a planned trip to Washington next week due to his disagreement with Trump over which country should pay for the promised wall. Critics say May's desire for new economic partners outside the EU's single market of 500 million people is blinding her to Trump's disregard for facts and civil liberties, sweeping edicts and isolationist stance. Historian Simon Schama dubbed May \"Theresa Appeaser,\" while Labour Party lawmaker Ed Miliband tweeted that her warm words for Trump should make her fellow Conservatives \"feel queasy.\" Trump has spoken enthusiastically about having a free-trade deal with Britain, although been cool on trade agreements generally. He is pulling the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 a deal Obama worked hard on \u2014 and has promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. May, in contrast, has vowed Britain will champion free trade around the world. On a personal level, the leaders could hardly be more different. Trump is a brash, spotlight-loving businessman; May is a small-town vicar's daughter who rose to the political top through prudence, caution and the avoidance of personal ostentation and controversy. Her most flamboyant feature is a fondness for leopard-print kitten-heel shoes. May insisted that the U.S.-U.K. relationship was not built on personalities. \"It's existed through many different prime ministers and presidents,\" she said aboard the plane. \"I want to build on that relationship. I believe, from the conversations I've already had with Donald Trump, that he does, too.\" And, she added: \"Sometimes opposites attract.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless 0 Shares ",

Among six politically appointed officials at the State Department to hand in their resignations was the Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who has worked at the department for over nine years and was first appointed to the job by President George W. Bush, officials said. \"Kennedy was an institution,\" as one senior State Department official put it. Kennedy helped lead the transition at the State Department for the incoming Trump administration and was a well-respected figure within the building. Yet many Republicans associated Kennedy with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's tenure, and dragged him into the fallout from the Benghazi terror attack as well as Clinton's private email controversy, making his departure somewhat unsurprising. Mexican President Cancels Meeting With Trump After Border Wall Order Senior State Department officials familiar with the circumstances insisted these resignations occurred not as a protest of the incoming administration, but said that they were essentially asked to leave, though they were technically not fired. By nature of their positions, these people would have been made to submit a resignation letter, but the administration doesn't have to accept it. Indeed some resignations were not. \"As is standard with every transition, the outgoing administration, in coordination with the incoming one, requested all politically appointed officers submit letters of resignation,\" Acting State Department Spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement today. \"The Department encourages and advocates for senior officers to compete for high level offices in the Department. These positions are political appointments, and require the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm them in these roles,\" Toner added. \"They are not career appointments but of limited term. Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the Foreign Service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service.\" President Trump's selection to be the next Secretary of State, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson , is expected to be confirmed by the Senate next week. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Everything You Need to Know About the Executive Order on Sanctuary Cities By Adam Kelsey Jan 26, 2017, 4:02 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Sanctuary Cities: Everything You Need to Know 0 Shares Email President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday singling out the country\u2019s sanctuary cities in an attempt to curtail what he has called \u201cvirtually unlimited immigration.\u201d \u201cSanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States,\u201d reads the order. \u201cThese jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.\u201d Critics of the president and advocates for undocumented immigrants were quick to criticize the order, with some calling it unconstitutional, while supporters lauded Trump for swift action on a campaign promise. Here\u2019s what you need to know: What Is a Sanctuary City? There is no precise definition of a sanctuary city, but the term generally applies to any municipality willing to defy federal immigration laws in order to protect undocumented immigrants. The practice began in the 1980s with cities such as San Francisco seeking to ease the transition of immigrants and incorporate them into the community. Local laws and ordinances mandated that city services be provided to all citizens regardless of their immigration status and that no resources be solely dedicated to the discovery or apprehension of undocumented immigrants. Since then, the term has evolved to include certain protections for undocumented immigrants. Some sanctuary cities refuse to allow their law enforcement officers to be deployed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and others, like Los Angeles, prohibit police from apprehending or questioning persons for the sole purpose of learning their immigration status. Additional jurisdictions decline requests by ICE to detain undocumented immigrants pending transfer to ICE, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center . Which Cities Are Sanctuary Cities? A large number of major cities across the U.S. have designated themselves sanctuary cities, including Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle, among others. A number of counties and smaller cities and towns have also adopted sanctuary status. Most notably, the two cities that President Trump calls home -- New York and Washington, D.C. -- are sanctuary cities. New York\u2019s status originated with an executive order signed in 1989 by then-Mayor Ed Koch. The order prevents local officials from \u201ctransmit[ting] information respecting any alien to federal immigration authorities\u201d unless in connection with other criminal activity. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser called a press conference Wednesday in response to Trump\u2019s executive order to reiterate the city\u2019s commitment to undocumented immigrants. She added that residents should not have to fear their deportation for actions such as calling 911 in an emergency or speaking to local police to report a crime. What Does the Executive Order Do? Is It Legal? Trump's executive order designates sanctuary cities as \u201cineligible to receive federal grants\u201d should they continue to disobey laws regulating undocumented immigrants, a move that could convince these jurisdictions to give up their status. This means that cities could potentially lose out on millions of dollars in federal funds, though it is unclear which funds will be targeted. A November review of the New York City budget claimed the city receives $7 billion in total federal assistance across all programs. Furthermore, the U.S. attorney general is directed to \u201ctake appropriate enforcement action,\u201d possibly in the form of legal proceedings, against sanctuary cities that do not comply, potentially stripping protections from undocumented immigrants. The order, if carried out, will likely face legal hurdles. The Supreme Court previously set a series of rules in 1987\u2019s South Dakota v. Dole that mandate when federal funds can be curbed. One of the rules is that such funds can\u2019t amount to a sum that would be \u201ccoercive,\u201d therefore forcing the recipient to comply with the federal government. Should a court decide that the funds represent a total large enough that Trump\u2019s order is coercive, it could be ruled unconstitutional. South Dakota v. Dole also dictates that the federal funds withheld must be related to the law. Therefore, Trump's order to suspend funding would likely be limited to federal grants related to immigration, like law enforcement, or else would be susceptible to legal action. It's further unclear whether the precedent set by South Dakota v. Dole regarding an act of Congress is applicable to executive orders. How Are Cities Responding? Following the signing of the order Wednesday, the leaders of several cities spoke out in opposition to the order. \u201cWe\u2019re going to defend all of our people regardless of where they come from, regardless of their immigration status,\" said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. \"The spirit of this executive order runs counter to our spirit and values as a city.\u201d San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee added, \u201cNothing has changed. Our city is still a sanctuary city. We are going to remain a sanctuary city precisely because the purpose is to keep everybody safe.\u201d Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel reaffirmed his city\u2019s status, saying, \"I want to be clear, we're going to stay a sanctuary city. There is no stranger among us.\" Leaders in Boston, Los Angeles and Seattle spoke out as well against the action Wednesday. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "AP January 26, 2017, 7:25 PM Advocates warn of fight ahead if Trump pursues torture Email LONDON \u2014\u00a0It took more than a year\u2019s worth of beatings, sleep deprivation, psychological abuse and threats to his family before former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg said he cracked and confessed to being a member of the al-Qaida terror network. The only problem, he said, was that it was a lie. It was only a matter of weeks for Mourad Benchellali, a Frenchman detained first at Kandahar in Afghanistan. \u201cBecause I was afraid, because I hurt, and because I told myself, when this is all worked out, I\u2019ll tell the truth. But for now, better to tell them what they want to hear,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Fran Townsend, CBS News senior national security analyst and former homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush, joins \"CBS This Mornin... Chris Arendt, a former guard at the U.S. detention facility in Cuba, said he routinely saw what could be defined as torture, including prisoners being unnecessarily pepper-sprayed or taken for interrogations that never happened. Instead, they were left shackled for hours as a means of punishment.\u00a0 During the year he spent at the U.S. detention facility in 2004, Arendt said it was clear that most of the detainees had relatively little valuable intelligence. \u201cI thought that if I confessed I would at least get access to the courts and my interrogations would stop being so adversarial,\u201d said the 48-year-old Begg, who confessed in 2003 but wasn\u2019t released until 2005, along with three other British detainees. Like most Guantanamo detainees, he was never charged.\u00a0 President Trump talked Wednesday about bringing back so-called \"enhanced interrogation\" for terror suspects. Protesters are also gathering in Phi... President Donald Trump is asking for recommendations on whether torture works, if secret CIA black sites should be used again to interrogate suspects and whether the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay should not only stay open, but should accept future detainees, according to a draft executive order that signals sweeping changes to U.S. interrogation and detention policy. The Associated Press and other news organizations obtained a copy. The draft directive, which the White House said was not official , would reverse President Barack Obama\u2019s order to close the Guantanamo Bay facility - a place Trump has said he wants to fill \u201cwith bad dudes.\u201d Trump, who has pushed for tougher interrogation techniques, said he would consult with new Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA director Mike Pompeo before authorizing any new policy. But he said he had asked top intelligence officials: \u201cDoes torture work? And the answer was \u2018Yes, absolutely.\u2019\u201d \u201cTo say that torture works is a bit like saying slavery works as a model of economic production,\u201d said Nigel Inkster, former director of operations at Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, MI6. \u201cIt\u2019s not the conversation we ought to be having.\u201d Even if it were, the answer is resoundingly negative, said Mark Fallon, who served as a U.S. counterterrorism investigator and tried to oppose the torture at Guantanamo when he learned about it during the administration of President George W. Bush. \u201cTorture is a very effective method to get somebody to say something you want them to say. It is not an effective method to get somebody to tell the truth or reliable information,\u201d he said.\u00a0 President Trump said he would not be opposed to bringing back torture as a means to combat terrorism. Former CIA covert operations officer Mike B... If the Trump administration resuscitates policies used under the Bush administration, it could jeopardize relations and intelligence sharing between the United States and European allies such as Britain. Prime Minister Teresa May, who is scheduled to meet Trump on Friday , told reporters that Britain \u201cabsolutely\u201d condemns the use of torture. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the draft order was not a \u201cWhite House-originated\u201d document, and House Speaker Paul Ryan said it was his understanding that it was written by someone who had earlier worked on the Trump transition team. \u201cThis is not something the Trump administration is planning on, working on,\u201d Ryan said. While it\u2019s unclear whether the Trump administration will return to policies seen in the war on terror, rights advocates say even the smallest move backward could bring legal troubles, especially with regard to CIA black sites that were used for interrogation. Binyam Mohamed is a former Guantanamo prisoner who was held at such a site in Morocco. The British and Ethiopian national was first arrested in Pakistan and then transported to Morocco under the U.S. \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d program, where he said his penis was sliced with a razor blade. He was then transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2004 and released in 2009.\u00a0 Graphic shows how waterboarding works on a subject CBS Mohamed and other detainees sued the British government for collusion with U.S. authorities, and in 2010, the UK Court of Appeal ruled that he had been subjected to \u201ccruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by the U.S. authorities.\u201d He and others were awarded a compensation settlement in 2011. \u201cIt would become impossible for the UK to share any intelligence that could potentially lead to the mistreatment of anyone,\u201d Inkster said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think there are many people in Western intelligence who regard Guantanamo as a success.\u201d After the Sept. 11 terror attacks, no two prisons came to symbolize the war on terror like Guantanamo Bay and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. When the Guantanamo Bay camp opened in January 2002, months after the Sept. 11 attacks, European reporters flocked to the outpost, plastering front pages with the first images of terror suspects. The men, clad in orange jumpsuits, were shown kneeling and bound next to U.S. military guards. More than 900 prisoners have since circled through the prison camp, some held for years without ever being charged. It also attracted a steady stream of controversies, including documents that showed prisoners were subjected to abuse. The bad press at Guantanamo coincided with graphic pictures of abuse out of Iraq\u2019s Abu Ghraib prison. The 2004 photographs documented a wide array of abuses against prisoners held in U.S. custody there. Prisoners were stripped naked or put in degrading poses. Two photographs showed a female guard holding a leash attached to a prisoner\u2019s neck while another hooded prisoner was forced to stand on a box. Some fear that if Trump embraces past policies, there could be a backlash from extremist groups, increasing the threat of terrorism against the United States. The Islamic State group has often shown prisoners wearing the same orange jumpsuits as Guantanamo detainees. \u201cExperience has shown that using torture doesn\u2019t work; it only grows hatred,\u201d said Ewan Watson, a spokesman at the International Committee of the Red Cross. \u201cIt sows the seeds of revenge, destroys the social fabric of communities and degrades a society\u2019s institutions.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union warned that if past policies return, the United States could see itself in the middle of a flurry of legal challenges at home and internationally. Torture is prohibited under international law. \u201cTrump\u2019s executive orders bring us back to the dark, lawless days of the Bush administration,\u201d said Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU. \u201cBlack sites, Guantanamo, torture appear to be back on the table as official policy of the U.S. government, even if these actions are known to be unlawful.\u201d Arendt, who was a guard when Begg was in Guantanamo, now works at a tattoo shop in Detroit but is still haunted by his experience. \u201cIf I could deliver a message to Trump it would be: Please stop and look at history. Don\u2019t make us a country of concentration camps and black sites,\u201d he said. \u201cNo good country should have to stoop to this level.\u201d The words \u201cconcentration camp\u201d flashed through Nizar Sassi\u2019s mind when he found himself in a pile of naked men after being violated in front of a roomful of military physicians in Kandahar. Freed from Guantanamo in 2004, the Frenchman\u2019s email address still bears the number he was given at the camp: 325. \u201cI no longer believe in the justice of man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to torture myself. Hatred that normally should be inked in my heart with what I\u2019ve endured would finish by destroying me first.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "What Will Trump's Twitter Strategy Be When He Becomes President? Manning acknowledged that Obama's opponents were unusually obstinate, writing that the former president \"faced unparalleled resistance from his opponents, many of whom wanted him to fail.\" However, Manning excoriated Obama for, in her eyes, compromising too much on health care and foreign policy, and she called for \"a strong and unapologetic progressive\" to lead the United States. It wasn't clear whether Trump's tweet was intended to come to Obama's defense \u2014 Trump, after all, has slammed the former president on many occasions. Rather, it may have been an opportunity to both criticize Manning and draw attention to criticism of Obama \u2014 criticism coming from someone whom Obama recently prevented from serving around 28 more years in prison, no less. Likewise, it's not clear whether Trump's tweets were inspired directly by the Guardian column. The tweets came minutes after a Fox News report that could easily have prompted them, as CNN's Brian Stelter tweeted. Reporting on the column, Fox and Friends First's Abby Huntsman said that \"the disgraced former Army private is slamming President Obama as a weak leader with few permanent accomplishments,\" while the words \"ungrateful traitor\" appeared at the bottom of the screen, as Mediaite pointed out . 14 minutes apart: Fox says \"ungrateful traitor,\" Trump says \"ungrateful traitor,\" Fox says \"weak leader,\" Trump says \"weak leader.\" pic.twitter.com/f7urTOUG1L \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 26, 2017 This wouldn't be the first time that Trump's tweets correlate with Fox News segments. As BuzzFeed's Brandon Wall pointed out earlier this week, a recent tweet about violence in Chicago may also have been inspired by a segment on the O'Reilly Factor. NPR thanks our sponsors Correction Jan. 26, 2017 A previous version of this article stated that Obama had prevented Chelsea Manning from serving 18 more years in prison. It's 28 more years. ",

(Photo: Jose Luis Magana, AP) Six journalists await their legal fates after they were among the\u00a0230 people charged with rioting during the Inauguration Day events in downtown Washington. The felony charge of \"Rioting\u00a0or inciting to riot,\" carries the potential for 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000. The six were released the following day,\u00a0each with preliminary hearings scheduled within the next two months. All were near\u00a0the #DisruptJ20 protests on the streets not far from where \u2014 and\u00a0at about the same time as \u2014\u00a0President Trump was being inaugurated Jan. 20 at the U.S. Capitol. News outlets showed smashed windows in businesses and in vehicles\u00a0in the area. Police charged those arrested with\u00a0felony rioting, which is used when there's property damage of $5,000 or more, or serious bodily damage. According to police reports, protesters\u00a0smashed out plate glass windows at businesses including Starbucks Coffee, SunTrust Bank\u00a0and Wells Fargo Bank and destroyed a limousine. Damage caused was in excess of $100,000, police say, and some police officers were injured as protesters resisted arrest; one officer was\u00a0taken to the hospital and since released. Here's what women who oppose Trump are doing now to fight his agenda \"Based on the facts and circumstances, we determined that probable cause existed to support the filing of felony rioting charges,\" said the U.S. Attorney's Office\u00a0for the District of Columbia in a statement about the 230 arrested. The office, which enforces criminal laws in Washington, D.C.,\u00a0would not comment on the actions of the six journalists. The journalists charged were:\u00a0Evan Engel, a senior producer with online news site\u00a0 Vocativ ;\u00a0\u00a0Alex Rubinstein\u00a0of\u00a0 RT America , the Washington-based channel that is part of RT, the\u00a0state-sponsored media outlet originally known as Russia Today; documentary filmmaker\u00a0Jack Keller, independent live-streaming journalist Matthew Hopard , freelance journalist\u00a0 Aaron Cant\u00fa , who has written for Vice and The Guardian,\u00a0and independent photojournalist\u00a0Shay Horse. The charges were first reported by U.K.'s The Guardian . Legal observers and medical personnel were also among the large group that police surrounded before arresting them, said\u00a0Keller, who was covering the protests for the web series Story of America \u00a0and the team's upcoming documentary film on the social-political\u00a0division in the U.S. called\u00a0Journey into the Divide\u00a0in the U.S.\u00a0He was returned his video camera after being released, but not the video. \"I want to make it absolutely clear, as I did to the arresting officer, that I was there as a journalist and was simply observing the J20 protest,\" he said in statement emailed to USA TODAY.\u00a0\"My hope is that the DA will drop these charges-for which they have no supporting evidence- against journalists and observers immediately.\" Posted!

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Henry Kissinger is said to have posed the question: \u201cWho do I call if I want to call Europe?\u201d For President Obama and Hillary Clinton, that leader was German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\u00a0 That's evidently not the case under President Trump.\u00a0 German media is reporting that Merkel is struggling to come to grips with a decidedly less friendly administration in Washington, which is reaching out to stalwart allies Britain and Israel -- but reportedly has not responded to Berlin's request for a meeting.\u00a0 Trump also has singled out Merkel for criticism, reportedly l eaving her to scour Trump interviews in old Playboys to get a hint at the new president\u2019s thinking. Handelsblatt \u00a0reported that German government officials largely have failed to establish contacts with the Trump team, and \u201cdecision makers in Berlin have largely been left to read the tea leaves in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric and his recent interviews with the European press.\u201d This marks a sharp change from just a couple years ago.\u00a0 For much of the Obama administration, Merkel\u2019s popularity both at home and abroad was sky high, and her position unassailable. In 2015 she won Time\u2019s Person of the Year. Last year, Obama called her a \u201cmodel\u201d leader and his final call to a foreign leader was to Merkel, while Clinton \u2013 whom many in Europe expected to be the next president -- repeatedly praised her as one of her favorite world leaders. But Merkel's political fortunes have deteriorated. Her ill-fated 2015 decision to open the doors to millions of Syrian refugees fueled a continent-wide crisis, leading in part to the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. After her party was hammered in local elections and her poll numbers slumped ahead of federal elections this year, Merkel has started to distance herself from her refugee policy. As Merkel struggles to keep her grip on power in Germany, and keep the increasingly unstable European Union together, the German chancellor now faces another challenge in Trump \u2013 who has made no secret of his distaste for her policies. After the campaign, during which Trump accused Merkel of \u201cruining Germany,\u201d German media reported that Merkel\u2019s team was hoping for a change in tone when Trump took the White House. They were quickly disappointed. In a recent interview with the Times of London, Trump blasted her Syrian refugee policy as a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d and grouped her in with Russian President Vladimir Putin as people he would \u201cstart off trusting.\u201d He added, \u201cBut let's see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.\u201d That tone may be set to continue. While Trump quickly reached out to British Prime Minister Theresa May and arranged for her to come to the White House Friday \u2013 just seven days into Trump\u2019s presidency -- Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel reports that an offer from Merkel\u2019s team for her to come to Washington soon received no reply. The White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News.\u00a0 In the meantime, the Trump effect is causing concerns for Merkel beyond his criticism of her refugee stance. Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies could hurt manufacturing, particularly big German automakers such as BMW. Additionally, Trump\u2019s warm support for Brexit has emboldened the British government, with German lawmakers telling Der Spiegel that a \u201csofter\u201d form of Brexit is now much less likely. The Germans are still hoping the relationship can be salvaged. Handelsblatt reports that some lawmakers have good relations with Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and that Merkel\u2019s cabinet is hoping Defense Secretary James Mattis will push for stronger relations with Germany in particular.

Christian Torres/AP Updated at 6:45 p.m. ET The Trump administration is considering alternative ways to pay for the border wall, backtracking on the president's oft-repeated promise that Mexico would foot the bill. A White House spokesman said one idea taking shape is to apply a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, as well as other countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit. That would effectively saddle U.S. consumers with a significant portion of the wall's cost, estimated at $15 billion or more. Republicans Have Plans To Replace Obamacare \u2014 Now They Need To Agree On One Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer did not offer details about how the import tax would work, but he said it could be adopted as part of comprehensive tax reform. After the idea sparked controversy, Spicer later walked back the idea, saying that \"it could be a multitude of things.\" The tax could be 20 percent or 18 or 5, he said, adding that he wasn't trying to be \"prescriptive.\" Trump discussed the plan during a meeting in Philadelphia with congressional Republicans. Even floating this idea amounts to a remarkable capitulation by the new president, who was insisting as late as Wednesday that Mexico would bear the cost of the border barrier.

Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Trump next week, a decision that the U.S. president tried to explain as mutual. Mexico is one of America's top trading partners, with more than $500 billion worth of goods flowing across the Southern border each year. Spicer argued that adding a 20 percent surcharge to imports from Mexico would quickly cover the cost of the wall. \"This is the beginning of this plan to make sure it's done right,\" Spicer told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One. \"It clearly provides the funding and it does so in a way that ensures that the American taxpayer is wholly respected.\" Border security yes, tariffs no.

Huge barrier to econ growth /1 \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017 Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad. (2) \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017 The suggestion drew a swift rebuke from at least one Republican senator, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, who said it would be a bad idea to do anything that raises the price of Corona, tequila or margaritas. (Graham's family used to own a bar.) House Speaker Paul Ryan's office contended the White House and Congress were on the \"same page.\" \"We have been and continue to be on the same page about tax reform that supports American jobs and American goods,\" Ryan aide AshLee Strong told NPR's Susan Davis. That's because Ryan has proposed a \"border adjustment\" tax that would affect the \"corporate tax rates applied to goods and services consumed in the U.S. but not applied to goods and services exported,\" a Republican Capitol Hill source added. The plan would allow corporations to subtract export sales when calculating their tax bill, but companies would not be allowed to deduct the cost of imports. Under the current tax code, export sales are taxed, and import costs are deductible. If Trump is embracing Ryan's plan, it would be a reversal. Just 10 days ago, he told the Wall Street Journal that a \"border adjustment tax\" was \"too complicated.\" Many unanswered questions about proposed \"border adjustment\" tax \"Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it,\" Trump said. \"Because usually it means we're going to get adjusted into a bad deal. That's what happens.\" Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said the plan raises questions. GOP '200 Day' Agenda Calls for Spending, Tax Cuts. But What About the Deficit? Spicer brushed aside suggestions that much of the cost would be passed on to American consumers who purchase Mexican-made goods. He argued that cost would be outweighed by the reduction in illicit border crossings. \"What it's going to do is lift up the wages of American workers,\" Spicer said. \"Right now we've got an influx of cheap labor. It's going to put the American consumer back, net-net, to make sure that American workers get lifted up as well.\" Back in Washington, after the original comments, Spicer said, \"I don't think our job right now is to roll something out and/or be prescriptive; it's to show that there are ways the wall can be paid for. Full stop.\" He added that he was trying to address \"questions about how the president could pay for the wall.\" He said, \"The idea is to show that generating revenue for the wall is not as difficult as some might have suggested.\" But \"there's nothing to roll out, so the idea of asking for details on something, we're not there yet.\" Spicer also suggested that building the border wall would produce savings elsewhere in the federal budget. \"I think we're going to save additional money that we would have had to spend on tracking down illegal immigrants and on immigration,\" Spicer said. \"So it's actually a huge win for the American taxpayer and for American security when you look at the kind of plan that's coming to fruition right now.\" Trump actually wants to increase spending on immigration enforcement. In addition to the wall, he has ordered the hiring of 15,000 new Border Patrol and immigration officers and the construction of new detention facilities. ",

By Joshua Partlow By Joshua Partlow January 26 at 5:47 PM Follow @partlowj MEXICO CITY \u2014 A deep rift opened Thursday between the United States and its southern neighbor as the Trump administration pressed forward with a plan for a giant border wall and insisted that Mexico would pay for it, possibly through a U.S. tax on imports. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Thursday called off a trip to Washington after restating that Mexico would not finance the wall. Hours later, Trump's spokesman, Sean Spicer, said the wall could be funded by a 20 percent import tax on goods from Mexico. Spicer did not provide details of how the policy would be implemented or whether the tax on Mexican exports to the United States would be part of a broader import tax backed by some House Republicans. The plan would need congressional approval. Spicer subsequently appeared to backtrack, telling reporters that the tax was \u201cone idea\u201d to pay for the wall and that his intent was not to \u201croll out\u201d a new policy. Critics said that if implemented, such a tax would mean that the wall\u2019s cost ultimately would be borne by U.S. consumers. (Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post) Pe\u00f1a Nieto had been scheduled to meet with Trump on Tuesday to discuss immigration, trade and drug-war cooperation. He called off the visit after Trump tweeted that it would be \u201cbetter to cancel the upcoming meeting\u201d if Mexico was unwilling to pay for the wall. Trump\u2019s moves have rekindled old resentments in Mexico, a country that during its history has often felt bullied and threatened by its wealthier, more powerful neighbor. The legacy of heavy-handed U.S. behavior \u2014 which includes invasions and the seizure of significant Mexican lands \u2014 has mostly been played down by a generation of Mexican leaders who have pursued pragmatic policies and mutual economic interests with both Republican and Democratic U.S. administrations. Both Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Spicer said their countries were interested in maintaining positive relations. \u201cWe will keep the lines of communication open,\u201d Spicer told reporters in Washington on Thursday morning, adding that the White House would \u201clook for a date to schedule something in the future.\u201d The Mexican president tweeted that his government was willing to work with the United States \u201cto reach agreements that benefit both nations.\u201d But Mexicans expressed shock and dismay as Trump moved to turn his campaign promises into reality. [ Why Trump can\u2019t simply build a border wall with an executive order ] Mexicans view a wall across the 2,000-mile border as a symbolic affront, part of a package of Trump policies that could cause the country serious economic pain. They include a crackdown on illegal immigrants, who send billions of dollars home, and renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. The treaty has allowed trade between the neighbors to mushroom. Every day, goods valued at $1.4 billion cross the U.S.-Mexico border, and millions of jobs are linked to trade on both sides. Mexico is the world\u2019s second-largest customer for American-made products, and 80 percent of Mexican exports \u2014 automobiles, flat-screen TVs, avocados \u2014 are sold to the United States. 5 challenges Trump may face building a border wall View Graphic 5 challenges Trump may face building a border wall Spicer told reporters Thursday that the wall could be funded by a plan to levy a 20 percent tax on imports from countries, including Mexico, with which the United States has a trade deficit. His plan startled U.S. politicians and congressional staffers who scrambled to figure out how the idea would work. Spicer said the plan could raise $10 billion a year. \u201cIf you think about what a border tax on imports from countries like Mexico that we have a huge trade deficit does, that\u2019s really going to provide the funding,\u201d Spicer said, according to a pool report. In Mexico, politicians and analysts railed against Trump\u2019s plans for the wall and a major crackdown on immigration, as well as a renegotiation of NAFTA. \u201cWhen we are talking about building a wall, about deporting migrants, about eliminating sanctuary cities [for migrants], about threatening to end a free-trade agreement, or to take away factories, we are really talking about causing human suffering,\u201d Margarita Zavala, a possible candidate for the presidency in 2018 and the wife of former president Felipe Calder\u00f3n, said in an interview. \u201cAnd after today, without a doubt, it is very difficult to negotiate from behind a wall.\u201d Mexicans said they had trouble recalling a time when relations were this bad with the United States or when an American president appeared to be such a threat to Mexico\u2019s core interests. \u201cNever,\u201d former president Vicente Fox said in an interview, when asked if Mexico had faced a comparable U.S. president in his lifetime. \u201cAnd I never thought the U.S. people would go for a president like this.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want the ugly American, which Trump represents: that imperial gringo that used to invade our country, that used to send the Marines, that used to put and take away presidents most everywhere in the world,\u201d Fox added. \u201cThat happened in the 20th century, and this is what this guy is menacing us with.\u201d Trump, for his part, faulted the Mexicans for damaging the relationship. Addressing a GOP policy retreat in Philadelphia, Trump said Thursday afternoon, \u201cThe president of Mexico and myself have agreed to cancel our planned meeting\u201d next Tuesday. \u201cUnless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless,\u201d he added. [ Border Patrol chief resigns after clashing with powerful union ] Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s decision to cancel the trip came a day after Trump signed an executive order to construct a border wall, one of Trump's signature promises and a rallying cry for his supporters during last year's presidential campaign. The timing of the order was seen as further insult: Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray was flying to Washington on Tuesday when news broke about Trump's impending border wall announcement. All day Wednesday, speculation was rampant that Pe\u00f1a Nieto might cancel his upcoming trip. In the meantime, Videgaray met at the White House with Craig Deare, who is in charge of Latin America on the National Security Council. Throughout Trump's rise, Pe\u00f1a Nieto has been mostly respectful toward him, even inviting him to visit Mexico City as a candidate last August. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has tried to maintain a diplomatic approach to the new administration, suggesting that Mexico can negotiate with its largest trading partner and preserve good relations. [ Mexicans are angry at their own president for meeting with Trump ] On Wednesday night, Pe\u00f1a Nieto sent out a recorded message saying that he \u201cregrets and disapproves\u201d of the U.S. decision to move forward with the wall. He repeated that Mexico will not pay for the wall but said he still planned to come to Washington to meet with Trump because of the importance of the negotiations. But that decision changed after Trump\u2019s tweet on Thursday morning. During his speech at the GOP policy retreat later in the day in Philadelphia, Trump described NAFTA as a \u201cterrible deal, a total disaster for the United States,\u201d and said that the move of manufacturing to Mexico cost millions of American jobs and the closure of \u201cthousands and thousands of plants\u201d across the United States.

Conway said on the TODAY Show that Trump has been \"very clear and consistent on this point that he's going to build the wall and Mexico will pay for it, whether they pay for it straight out or it's reimbursed later on after a congressional funding.\" \"The U.S. spends billions of dollars protecting other countries' borders,\" she said. \"It's high time we spend money protecting our own.\" Trump signed two executive orders aimed at curbing illegal immigration on Wednesday, including one that would redirect redirecting existing Homeland Security money to build what the administration described as a \"very large\" wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. But hours after Trump signed the orders, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto again stressed his country would not be paying for the wall. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said in a brief address to Mexico that he \"regrets and rejects\" Trump's orders because \"Mexico does not believe in walls.\" Related: President Trump Says He Will Ask for 'Major Investigation' Into Unsubstantiated Allegations of Voter Fraud \"I have said it over and over again: Mexico will not pay for any wall,\" he stressed. The Mexican leader was scheduled to meet with Trump next Tuesday to discuss immigration and trade, but later Thursday morning Pe\u00f1a Nieto tweeted that he had informed the White House that he \"will not attend\" the scheduled business meeting next week. Trump had tweeted earlier Thursday that if Mexico refused to pay for the wall it might be best to cancel their upcoming meeting. Speaking later Thursday, Trump said during his address to the GOP retreat in Philadelphia that the decision not to meet was mutual . Conway Claims Tiffany Trump Not Registered in Two States \u2014 Despite Records Conway claimed it was \"flatly false\" that Tiffany Trump was registered in two states, but election records in both Pennsylvania and New York show she is still registered as an \"active\" voter in both as of Thursday morning. Conway cited a conversation with Trump's youngest daughter as evidence during an interview with Matt Lauer on the TODAY Show. \"She had been registered in Pennsylvania and went through the process, [and] said it was very byzantine and took a long time, but she said that she is not registered to vote in two states,\" Conway said of her conversation with Tiffany Trump. A local election official also confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday and again on Thursday morning that she was still registered to vote in Philadelphia. Play ",

Matt Hoffman reports. Buzz60 This undated photo provided by the Salk Institute on Jan. 24, 2017, shows a 4-week-old pig embryo that had been injected with human stem cells. The experiment was a very early step toward the possibility of growing human organs inside animals for transplantation. (Photo: Salk Institute via AP) NEW YORK \u2014\u00a0Scientists have grown human cells inside pig embryos, a very early step toward the goal of growing livers and other human organs in animals to transplant into people. The cells made up just a tiny part of each embryo, and the embryos were grown for only a few weeks, researchers reported Thursday. Such human-animal research has raised ethical concerns. The U.S. government suspended taxpayer funding of experiments in 2015. The new work, done in California and Spain, was paid for by private foundations. Any growing of human organs in pigs is \u201cfar away,\u201d said Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., an author of the paper in the journal Cell. He said the new research is \u201cjust a very early step toward the goal.\u201d Even before that is achieved, he said, putting human cells in animals could pay off for studies of how genetic diseases develop and for screening potential drugs. Animals with cells from different species are called chimeras. Such mixing has been done before with mice and rats. Larger animals like pigs would be needed to make human-size\u00a0organs. That could help ease the shortage of human donors for transplants. The Salk team is working on making humanized pancreases, hearts and livers in pigs. The animals would grow those organs in place of their own, and they\u2019d be euthanized before the organ is removed. Most of the organ cells would be human. By injecting pig embryos with stem cells from the person who will get the transplant, the problem of rejection should be minimized, said another Salk researcher, Jun Wu. Daniel Garry of the University of Minnesota, who is working on chimeras but didn\u2019t participate in the new work, called the Cell paper \u201can exciting initial step for this entire field.\u201d Here\u2019s what the new paper reports: Scientists used human stem cells, which are capable of producing a wide variety of specialized cells. They injected pig embryos made in the lab with three to 10 of those cells apiece, and implanted the embryos into sows. At three to four weeks of development, 186 embryos were removed and examined. Less than 1 in every 100,000 embryonic cells was human, which still comes to about a million human cells, Wu said. That contribution is lower than expected, he said, \u201cbut we were very happy to see we actually can see the human cells after four weeks of development.\u201d The cells generated the precursors of muscle, heart, pancreas, liver and spinal cord tissue in the embryos. The researchers said they plan to test ways to focus human cells on making specific tissues while avoiding any contribution to the brain, sperm or eggs. That addresses ethical concerns that the approach could accidentally lead to pigs that gain some human qualities in their brains\u00a0or make human egg or sperm. There was no sign of that in the new research. The government, meanwhile, has signaled that it may lift the federal funding ban soon but impose extra oversight of any proposed work. A pig might not always have to be brought to term, Belmonte and Wu said. Even a pig fetus might provide human pancreatic cells to treat diabetes\u00a0or kidney cells to repair injuries to that organ, they said. The University of Minnesota\u2019s Garry said the research offers some direction about what kind of human stem cells will work best. And it shows a need for boosting the number of human cells that appear in the embryo, he said. Hiromitsu Nakauchi of Stanford University said his own unpublished experiments with pig and sheep embryos also found a sparse contribution from injected human cells. That\u2019s a challenge for making organs, but it might be surmounted by focusing cells on doing that job, he said. Ethics experts were also impressed by the results. \u201cIt really does give a green light to explore more,\u201d said Insoo Hyun of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Hyun said he understood why some people might object on moral grounds to making animals with human organs. \u201cIt seems kind of creepy,\u201d he said. But \u201cthis is a strategy to help save human lives\u201d and so it is justified if properly done, he said. 5059 CONNECT TWEET 13 LINKEDIN 31 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k8jdSe NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

(Photo: WFAA-TV, Dallas-Fort Worth) FORT WORTH, Texas\u00a0\u2014 Police dropped charges Thursday against a woman and her teen daughter arrested after they had called authorities for help after a choking. Cellphone video of the arrests of Jacqueline Craig, 46, and daughter Brea Hymond, 19, spread online in December.\u00a0Craig had called Fort Worth police Dec. 21 to report that a man, later identified as Itamar Vardi,\u00a0had choked her 7-year-old son while accusing him of littering. Officer William Martin responded to the call, and an argument between Martin and Craig escalated. Martin eventually pulled out his Taser and put Craig, Hymond and a third female in custody, charging them with resisting arrest, search or transport. \u201cThis decision didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\" Chief Joel Fitzgerald of Fort Worth Police said\u00a0about not pressing charge. \"My decision to pull back these charges was something that I thought was right, something that we owed the community and the Craig family in particular.\u201d Texas officer on restricted duty after videotaped arrests Martin received a 10-day suspension without pay and returned to work this week. In the more than a month since Craig's arrest occurred, multiple protests were organized calling for the officer to be fired. Instead, Martin won't return to his assignment in the\u00a0Rock Garden neighborhood where the arrests occurred and will go through what Fitzgerald called\u00a0\"a tremendous amount of retraining.\" Vardi was issued a citation for assault by contact. Police officer, suspect shot in Texas traffic stop No parts of the case will be referred to a grand jury, according to a Tarrant County spokesperson. Fort Worth police have opened an investigation into the unauthorized release of body-camera footage from Martin that also surfaced Thursday on YouTube. In the days following the arrest, Fitzgerald said he was disappointed\u00a0after seeing the viral arrest video and said Martin acted rude\u00a0toward the family. He\u00a0stopped short of labeling it as racism.

    "text": "WATCH Some Sanctuary Cities Vow to Defy Trump Immigration Orders 0 Shares The nation's undocumented immigrants -- approximately 11 million by a 2014 Pew Research estimate -- could be made a priority for deportation as a result of the executive order signed by President Donald Trump Wednesday, according to legal experts. The order delineates several categories of undocumented immigrants who are priority for removal from the United States including those who have been \"charged with any criminal offense\" or those who have \"committed acts that constitute as a chargeable offense.\" On the campaign trail, Trump has vacillated several times on the issue, at first indicating that all undocumented immigrants would be sent back\" if they've done well they're going out and they're coming back in legally.\" Then he tempered his remarks to focus on undocumented immigrants who committed crimes. But Trump's executive order appears to extend beyond this. \"Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety,\" the order states. \"This is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.\" Anyone who came to the U.S. illegally -- that is without passing through border inspection committed a criminal misdemeanor and could fall into the priority removal category, legal experts tell ABC News. White House Clarifies Trump Tweet on Sending 'Feds' Into Chicago While overstaying a visa is not a criminal offense, legal experts say that those who do so could fall under a vague clause in the executive order that undocumented immigrants who \"have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter\" are a priority for deportation as well. \"This is scary stuff for America's legacy of immigration, for business and for our hospitality,\" said Michael Wildes, an immigration attorney who formerly represented Trump Models, the Miss Universe Organization and Melania Trump . \"Lady Liberty is probably closing her eyes right now in New York Harbor.\" The executive order is \"remarkably broad,\" said David Martin, a University of Virginia School of Law professor who specializes in immigration, constitutional law and international law. \"This order takes that notion of 'criminal alien' to its farthest reaches,\" Martin continued. A professor from Yale Law School, Peter Schuck, also called Trump's executive order \"extraordinarily broad\" and said that one provision that states \"ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds\" could be read to mean all federal funding, not just law enforcement assistance going to sanctuary cities such as San Francisco, Austin and New York. The orders stipulate an increase in the number of border patrol enforcement officers and lay the groundwork for building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, a longtime campaign promise of Trump's. \"President Trump's fantasy of sealing the border with a wall is driven by racial and ethnic bias that disgraces America's proud tradition of protecting vulnerable migrants,\" said Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU 's Immigrants' Rights Project. \"The DHS deportation force has a track record of racial profiling and excessive force abuses, and expanding it will further erode the rights of millions of people who call our safe border communities home. Locking up asylum seekers who pose no danger or flight risk is unconstitutional and benefits nobody except private prison corporations and politicians looking to score rhetorical points. We will see the Trump administration in court if they go down that road,\" Jadwat said in a statement. ABC News' Serena Marshall and Jordyn Phelps contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Chris Zoeller/Mason City Globe Gazette/globegazette.com An underground pipeline that runs through multiple Midwestern states has leaked an estimated 138,000 gallons of diesel fuel, according to the company that owns it, Magellan Midstream Partners. Clay Masters of Iowa Public Radio reported diesel leaking from a 12-inch underground pipe was initially spotted in a farm field in north-central Worth County, Iowa, on Wednesday morning. Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Iowa Department of Natural Resources joined representatives of Magellan and other local officials at the site, Masters reported. \"It's a big one \u007f\u2014 it's significant,\" Jeff Vansteenburg of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources told the Des Moines Register . \"The product is under pressure, so as soon as a leak develops, it starts coming out pretty fast,\" Vansteenburg said at a Wednesday evening news conference. \"Vacuum trucks are sucking up as much liquid as they can and taking that down to Magellan's terminal. ... Once they've recovered all the free product that they can then they will go in and remove contaminated soil.\" Vansteenburg said the diesel had not reached nearby Willow Creek or a wildlife protection area. Article continues after sponsorship A safety plan submitted by the company to the U.S. Department of Transportation in 2014 lists the pipeline, which runs through Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, as a transport route for multiple refined oil products, \"including Diesel, Gasoline, Jet fuel, Natural gasoline, Naptha, Propane, Natural Gas, Butane.\" Utility Giant PG&E Convicted of Violating Gas Pipeline Safety Laws Maps of the pipeline were redacted from the public version of the report. The leak occurred when the pipeline ruptured and diesel sprayed out, a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources told the Register. More than a foot of snow has fallen since Monday in some parts of north-central Iowa. As of Wednesday afternoon, cleanup crews had sucked up \"about 25,000 gallons of diesel and a slush-diesel mixture,\" reported the Globe Gazette newspaper in Mason City, Iowa. Another pipeline operated by Magellan leaked near Decatur, Neb., last October, according to the Omaha World-Herald , which reported that a ruptured pipe carrying anhydrous ammonia killed one person and led to the evacuation of 23 households. In 2010, the company agreed to pay a $46,200 penalty for violating the Clean Water Act, after an estimated 5,000 gallons of diesel spilled into a creek near Milford, Iowa. That year, Magellan was also fined $418,000 for a 45,000-gallon gasoline spill in Oklahoma. In November, the company temporarily shut down its pipelines in order to inspect them after an earthquake in Cushing, Okla., damaged several buildings, as we reported . ",

Click here to subscribe to Todd\u2019s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! The teacher, at W.H. Adamson High School in Dallas, posted the video to her Instagram account along with the following message: \u201cWatching the #inauguration in my classroom like\u2026#no #stop #denial #squirtgun #hypocrisy #powerless #saveusall #teachthembetter #atleastitsfriday.\u201d Voices can be heard in the background \u2013 but the school district would not say if students witnessed the teacher\u2019s disturbing demonstration. The Inauguration Day video has since been removed, but several prominent conservative websites managed to save a copy including Town Hall and Resistance Media. Video of the inauguration was being broadcast inside the classroom on a whiteboard. The video shows the teacher lunging at President Trump and firing the squirt gun numerous times while shouting, \u201cDie!\u201d It is disturbing, to say the least. Dallas Independent School District seems to be taking the matter quite seriously. \"Today, we were made aware of a social media posting being circulated involving a teacher at W. H. Adamson High School,\u201d a district spokesperson told me. \u201cThe teacher has been placed on administrative leave and the district has opened an investigation. This is a personnel matter and as such we cannot comment.\u201d I wonder which offense the school district finds worst: a faux assassination or a teacher using a squirt gun on school property. Since the 2016 presidential election, liberal educators across the fruited plain have gone slap crazy. I wrote about these phenomena in my new book, \u201cThe Deplorables\u2019 Guide to Making America Great Again.\u201d Some teachers have even turned their classrooms into breeding grounds for anti-Trump propaganda \u2013 going so far as to portray the commander-in-chief as a modern-day Adolf Hitler. And I lost count of the number of educators who refused to broadcast the inauguration ceremony over fears that some fragile snowflake might take offense. But what happened in Dallas is yet another example of how our public schools have been turned into social engineering petri dishes festering with rancorous rhetoric and hate. What kind of a person would stage a faux assassination attempt in of all places Dallas? It\u2019s simply repulsive. Let\u2019s hope Dallas ISD can muster the moral courage to take swift action to rebuke this teacher and send a message that this kind of hate has no place in a public school classroom.

Authorities search a New Hampshire home in the case of a woman who once lived there and disappeared more than 35 years ago. (Elise Amendola / Associated Press) Hailey Branson-Potts Contact Reporter A drifter who died in a California prison while serving time for killing and dismembering a Contra Costa County woman has been linked to the disappearance of a New Hampshire woman and to the deaths of another woman and three children whose bodies were found in metal drums in the woods of New England, authorities said Thursday. New Hampshire State Police and the state attorney general\u2019s office said they used a long and complicated trail of DNA evidence to determine that a Susanville, Calif., inmate was a possible serial killer who used at least five different aliases as he preyed on women and children over several decades. \u201cThis is a guy who was a chameleon,\u201d New Hampshire Asst. Atty. General Jeffrey Strelzin said in a news conference. People who knew him \u201csaid generally he was a strange guy but just didn\u2019t have a lot of information about him,\u201d Strelzin said. In the early 1980s, the man, using the name Bob Evans, was living in Manchester, N.H., with a woman named Denise Beaudin and her infant daughter, who was not his child. Shortly after Thanksgiving in 1981, Beaudin, then 23, went missing and has not been seen since. Police assume she is dead, but a body has never been found. Beaudin\u2019s family assumed she left town with Evans to avoid financial troubles, and they did not report her as missing, authorities said. Police believe Evans killed Beaudin and disposed of her body at some point between leaving Manchester and before he and Beaudin\u2019s daughter turned up in California. There are long gaps in authorities\u2019 knowledge of the man\u2019s whereabouts. Between 1984 and 1985, he was hired as an electrician in Los Alamitos, Calif., using the name Curtis Kimball. In 1985, he was arrested in Citrus for driving while intoxicated and endangering a child. He had Beaudin\u2019s daughter with him, Manchester, N.H., Police Capt. Ryan Grant said Thursday. After his arrest, he was living and working at a Santa Cruz County trailer park, where he left the girl with a family and abandoned her. They kept her for a short time before telling authorities. The girl was put into foster care and later adopted. By October 1986, California authorities were investigating the drifter for child abandonment, and felony warrants were issued for his arrest. The warrants identified another alias: Gordon Curtis Jensen, authorities said. Two years later, he was arrested in San Luis Obispo for driving a stolen vehicle from Idaho. He was also using the name Gerry Mockerman. While he was serving jail time for the theft, authorities used his fingerprints to determine that he was the same man wanted for child endangerment. He was paroled in 1990 and fell off authorities\u2019 radar for 12 years as a fugitive, according to the New Hampshire State Police. In the summer of 2001, the man, who was back in California working odd jobs under the name Lawrence Vanner, had an \u201cunofficial backyard marriage ceremony\u201d in Richmond, Calif., with a woman named Eunsoon Jun. No official marriage paperwork was filed, authorities said. A year later, Jun\u2019s dismembered body\u00a0was found buried in her basement. The man was arrested and sentenced to 15 years to life for Jun\u2019s murder. According to Strelzin, the man pleaded guilty against the advice of his attorneys. After his arrest, authorities who had tied him to the earlier child abandonment case used DNA evidence to determine that he was not biologically related to Beaudin\u2019s daughter and began an investigation to identify her. The man died in prison in 2010. Authorities admit they do not know the man\u2019s real name or how old he was, but they believe he was in his late 60s or early 70s when he died, Strelzin said. Meanwhile, Beaudin\u2019s daughter \u2014 who, authorities said, is now a mother of three \u2014 provided her DNA to an ancestry website and learned who her mother was. Police recently searched the Manchester, N.H., home where the drifter lived with Beaudin and her daughter before they went missing in 1981 but found nothing, authorities said. The attorney general\u2019s office has been communicating with Beaudin\u2019s daughter, whom they say had been abused by the man. The drifter was recently linked to the bodies of a woman and three children found in barrels near a state park in Allenstown, N.H., after DNA revealed that he was the father of one of the children, Strelzin said. The case of the bodies found in the barrels had long stumped investigators. In 1985, a hunter on a wooded property near Bear Brook State Park found the partially dismembered and decomposing bodies of a woman and a young girl, between the ages of 5 and 11, stuffed in a barrel and wrapped in garbage bags tied with electrical wire, authorities said. Fifteen years later, an investigator working the case went back to the property and found another barrel containing two more young girls. One of those girls, believed to be  about\u00a04 years old, was the drifter\u2019s daughter, police said. The Allenstown victims have not been identified, authorities said. It is unclear who the mother of the drifter\u2019s child is, and authorities fear she too was killed, Strezlin said. Authorities believe the woman whose body was found in the barrel is probably the mother of the eldest and youngest girls, but the identity of their father is unknown. The victims found in the barrels were probably \u00a0 killed in the 1980s, authorities said.\u00a0 Authorities said the drifter was working at that time as an electrician at a local mill; his supervisor was the man who owned the property where the bodies were found, Strezlin said. The victims in the barrels\u00a0all died of blunt force trauma, as did Jun in California. Police are now trying to identify the victims and learn anything they can about the drifter. There could be more victims, especially given the long gaps in authorities\u2019 knowledge of his whereabouts, Strezlin said. They are particularly concerned about his activities in California. Authorities say he may have had a military background. \u201cWe believe we have our killer,\u201d Strezlin said. \u201cNow we need to identify and try to find all of his victims.\u201d Investigators will continue to comb the property where the barrels were found, he said.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Mary Tyler Moore \u00a0was a beloved TV icon who symbolized the independent career woman.

    "text": "Jan 26 2017, 3:28 pm ET Four Top State Department Officials Ousted as Trump Administration Takes Shape by Abigail Williams and Corky Siemaszko Share advertisement The Trump administration began cleaning house Thursday in the State Department by ousting four top officials. Those exiting include Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, two assistant secretaries, Joyce Barr and Michele Bond, and Gentry Smith, who heads the department's Office of Foreign Missions, NBC News has confirmed. A sign stand outside the U.S. State Department in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong / Getty Images Two State Department officials confirmed to NBC News that Bond had intended to stay on into the next administration. Now her last day is Friday. \"I cannot adequately express how proud I am of our Bureau's profound, positive impact on U.S. diplomacy,\" she wrote in a letter to her staff. Both the Trump Administration and the union representing the workers insisted that turnover at the top is typical when a new president takes over. But the quartet's departure comes amid reports that other long-serving diplomats have chosen to quit rather than serve under President Trump. They include Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, and Gregory Starr, the assistant secretary for diplomatic security who retired on Inauguration Day. Acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the departures of longtime staffers is just business as usual. \"As is standard with every transition, the outgoing administration, in coordination with the incoming one, requested all politically appointed officers submit letters of resignation,\" he said.\"These positions are political appointments, and require the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm them in these roles. They are not career appointments but of limited term.\" Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, Toner said \"some will continue in the Foreign Service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service. \" Play Foreign Relations Committee Approves Rex Tillerson for Sec. of State in 11-10 Vote 1:48 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170127013442if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/861038659852\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Toner was echoed by the The American Foreign Service Association. \"While this appears to be a large turnover in a short period of time, a change of administration always brings personnel changes, and there is nothing unusual about rotations or retirements in the Foreign Service,\" AFSC said. Trump's pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson , is expected to be confirmed by the Senate next week. A career foreign service officer, Kennedy was tapped for his post in 2007 by President George W. Bush and continued to serve in that spot under President Obama. He was the department's chief bean counter, tasked with overseeing the budget, finances, security and consular services. Kennedy, who started working for the agency in 1973, was dragged out of obscurity after four Americans were killed in Benghazi, Libya. Dragged before a Congressional committee, Kennedy defended then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's response to the crisis and swore under oath there was no order to the U.S. military to \"stand down\" during the attack. Kennedy came under scrutiny for discussions he had with the FBI over the classification level of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile, a changing of the guard was underway in other top federal agencies with high-level officials tendering their resignations and heading for the exits \u2014 taking years of experience with them. NBC News has also learned that Border Patrol chief Mark Morgan has quit a post he has held just since October. Kevin McAleenan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, broke the news to the ranks in a letter. \"On behalf of the men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Border Patrol, I want to thank Mark Morgan for his unwavering dedication to our border security mission, and recognize his life-long career in service to the nation,\" he wrote. Earlier, the Trump administration broke with precedent and ordered all politically-appointed U.S. ambassadors to clear out by Inauguration Day rather than give them a grace period.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose own website this week still praised the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, now applauds Mr. Trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many Republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of Russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of both. Even on the subject of Mr. Trump\u2019s call for an investigation into voter fraud , a widely debunked claim, Republicans have often demurred. \u201cThe notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,\u201d said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Mr. Trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. \u201cThis Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we\u2019ve had in decades, maybe ever,\u201d Mr. Trump said. In an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to sign the stuff that you\u2019re writing. You\u2019re not wasting your time.\u201d Photo Mr. Trump took his first official flight on Air Force One on Thursday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Many Republicans in Congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the Obama administration\u2019s decisions to halt the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects. \u201cI think he\u2019s completely winning the expectation game,\u201d said Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois. \u201cI think he\u2019s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable.\u201d In one significant way, congressional Republicans potentially seemed to pull Mr. Trump to their end of the policy pool. On Thursday, the administration initially appeared to endorse taxing imports as a way to pay for the Mexican border wall, reversing its earlier preference for imposing a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas. But the White House later said it was just one option under consideration. \u201cWe are in a very good place on tax reform,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cIt can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it\u2019s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, I think most people agree that this is the right approach.\u201d Congressional Republicans are also struggling to keep up with Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid-fire announcements, let alone push their agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s fast-paced stuff,\u201d said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. Investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see Congress take on. \u201cOur priorities are the ones we laid out,\u201d he said. They are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda \u2014 specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe are on the same page with the White House,\u201d Mr. Ryan insisted Thursday. \u201cThe president agrees with this agenda.\u201d Advertisement But it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with Republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation.

Got it Mark A. Morgan testifies Sept. 13, 2016, at his first hearing as U.S. Border Patrol chief at the Cannon House Office Building before the Border and Maritme Security subcommittee on interior checkpoints and defense-in-depth. (Donna Burton/ U.S. Customs and Border Protection) By Jerry Markon , Lisa Rein and Wesley Lowery By Jerry Markon , Lisa Rein and Wesley Lowery January 26 at 6:13 PM Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @Reinlwapo Follow @WesleyLowery The chief of the U.S. Border Patrol has resigned after only six months on the job, one day after President Trump announced plans to ratchet up immigration enforcement and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, officials said Thursday. Officials familiar with the decision said that Morgan \u2014 a career FBI official who was the first outsider to lead the agency responsible for securing the U.S. borders \u2014 was removed by Kevin K. McAleenan, acting commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. \u201cIt was a change in leadership,\u2019\u2019 said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. But the official could not describe the reason for Morgan\u2019s removal, or whether the Border Patrol union or the White House were involved. His resignation is effective Jan. 31, officials said. Morgan had clashed with the powerful Border Patrol union, which endorsed Trump for president and whose leaders were present at Trump\u2019s announcement of his immigration crackdown at Department of Homeland Security headquarters Wednesday. (The Washington Post) Gil Kerlikowske, former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the Border Patrol, said in an interview that the union never supported Morgan for the job and appeared to be behind his departure. \u201cThe union has been very vocal about someone from outside of the Border Patrol becoming the head of the Border Patrol,\u201d Kerlikowske said. \u201cThe union supported this candidate for president, and now very much appears to be directing things \u2013 which is absolutely unheard of in law enforcement. The union used their influence to have him removed.\u2019\u2019 Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents 16,500 agents, said the union started actively lobbying Trump\u2019s transition team shortly after the election to replace Morgan, who the union believed \u201cdid not make border security a priority.\u201d For example, Morgan had diverted agents from the field to process migrants at ports of entry, a role traditionally handled by another unit at Customs and Border Patrol, Judd said. \u201cI assume they sent our concerns up the chain,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I know we had complete and total sway\u201d with the Trump team in pushing Morgan out? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Do I think we had a voice? Absolutely.\u201d Judd said he learned that Morgan had submitted his resignation at midday Thursday when he received a call on his cellphone from McAleenan. \u201cHe told me that \u2018for border security reasons, we need to go in a different direction.\u2019 \u201d A few weeks after Trump\u2019s election, the conservative website Breitbart.com published an op-ed by the union\u2019s executive board. The piece was titled, \u201cThe chief Obama gave us is a disgrace.\u201d It criticized Morgan\u2019s leadership of the agency, in part latching onto a statement he made to members of Congress that said he supported \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201d The union called this a partisan view. Morgan could not immediately be reached for comment. (Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post) Union spokesman Shawn Moran, responding to Kerlikowske\u2019s comments, said: \u201cWe supported President Trump because he was the only candidate who talked about taking action on border security. His actions over the past few days show it was not just campaign rhetoric, but a true conviction to protect Americans from the dangers of illegal immigration.\u201d He accused Kerlikowske of rolling back enforcement operations and \u201cpreventing agents from doing their jobs.\u201d \u201cGil Kerlikowske had multiple opportunities to work with the union to help protect Americans. He chose not to do so.\u201d McAleenan praised Morgan to agency staff \u201cfor his unwavering dedication to our border security mission\u201d and \u201chis lifelong career in service to the nation.\u2019\u2019 His statement did not explain the chief\u2019s departure. The Border Patrol will have an important role in enforcing Trump\u2019s crackdown on the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. The president signed executive actions Wednesday to order the construction of his controversial southwest border wall and cut off funds to cities that do not report undocumented immigrants to federal authorities. Trump also called for thousands of additional Border Patrol agents. There are now about 21,000. Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, was standing behind Trump as the president signed Wednesday\u2019s executive order on border security. Morgan was not. And in his speech to DHS employees, Trump called on Judd to stand and be recognized. Morgan, 52, started his career as a Los Angeles police officer before ascending the ranks of the FBI. Kerlikowske chose him for the Border Patrol job, overlooking others who came up through the ranks, to change what is considered, even by law enforcement standards, to be an insular culture. Many agents, including the Border Patrol union, opposed the selection at the time, saying an outsider could never gain agents\u2019 trust. Morgan told The Washington Post in an interview last September that his first priority was to change the culture of the agency, which had for years faced allegations of an overly confrontational approach in its enforcement that resulted in multiple fatal shootings of illegal immigrants and a lack of accountability in investigating misconduct. Morgan said he wanted to solve those problems. \u201c It was a culture of not getting out and talking about the issues, not being transparent about the process and it drove the perception there was a culture problem,\u201d he told The Post. Two years ago, Kerlikowske had brought Morgan over from the FBI to run the internal affairs office at the larger Customs and Border Protection agency after removing the longtime official in the job. That official had been criticized for failing to investigate multiple allegations that Border Patrol agents had used excessive force on migrants. Morgan was then promoted to run the Border Patrol in July. During his short tenure, Morgan enforced new use-of-force policies in the agency\u2019s training academy curriculum that encouraged recruits to turn to other strategies to defuse encounters that could get violent. He was working with agents to help them develop better intelligence on drug cartels and smugglers behind illegal border crossings, and was also seeking to create a system to better review cases in which agents fire their weapons. Law enforcement officials describe Morgan \u2014 who was a career, not political appointee \u2014 as a careerist, as opposed to being a political partisan. \u201cHe\u2019s not a political guy,\u201d said Jim Pasco, executive director the nation Fraternal Order of Police. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard a bad thing about him \u2013 and I work for a union, we hear bad things about everyone.\u201d world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

    "text": "By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch January 26, 2017, 5:00 AM Trump's wall could benefit this Mexican company Email President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed multibillion dollar \u201cgreat, great wall\u201d on America\u2019s southern border will surely need a lot of construction material, such as cement. And despite his intention to use the wall to keep out Mexicans who try to slip illegally into the U.S., the massive building project could actually be boon for one Mexican cement maker: Cemex ( CX ), which has extensive operations on both sides of the Rio Grande. According to Global Cement magazine, Cemex has six integrated cement plants within a 200-mile radius of the proposed border wall, more than California rival CalPortland, which has four plants, and Mexicos\u2019 Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua, which is focuses more on regional markets in the Western U.S. and the Mexican state of Chihuahua.\u00a0 Cemex, which is based near the city of Monterrey, is the world\u2019s third-largest cement producer when measured by production capacity, according to the trade magazine. In total it has 13 U.S. plants and its shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange. During 2015, Cemex generated $63 billon of its $225 billion in sales from the U.S., the most of any market where it operates. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to proceed with the building of a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, a major cornerst... \u201cThere are other suppliers of cement,\u201d said Phil Roseberg, an analyst with Bernstein Research, who doesn\u2019t officially rate Cemex, in an email. \u201cBut these are further away, and the cement will cost more to deliver.\u201d Under the leadership of its late CEO Regelio Zambrano, Cemex became the largest cement producer in the Americas, thanks to a $29 billion acquisition spree. The company\u2019s current CEO, Fernando Gonzalez, succeeded Zambrano in 2014. A spokesman for Cemex didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Cemex\u2019 U.S.-traded shares have surged more than 17 percent just since this year started as investors bet the company will benefit from Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to boost spending on U.S. infrastructure. \u201cCemex is one of the most prominent, the most successful Mexican firms,\u201d said Duncan Wood, the head of Wilson Center\u2019s Mexico Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible that it would become part of the construction process. However, I think there will be considerable pressure from the Mexican government to all Mexican cement firms to not participate in the building of the wall.\u201d Cementos de Chihuahua has said it would provide cement for the Trump wall, though it wasn\u2019t clear if the company was being deliberately \u201cprovocative,\u201d according to Wood. A spokesman for Cementos de Chihuahua didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Shannon O\u2019Neill of the Council on Foreign relations noted that the U.S. government can easily buy a commodity product like cement elsewhere, so it would be pointless for the Mexican government to prevent Mexican companies from seeking a wall contract. Donald Trump is deeply unpopular in Mexico, and not just because of his rhetoric on immigration. He has promised to significantly alter NAFTA, or... \u201cThe rising tension between the two governments over the wall, NAFTA and other issues requires a political solution,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cAnd to reach it, [Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto] won\u2019t be bullying Mexico\u2019s companies the way Trump has been treating their U.S. counterparts.\u201d Mr. Trump has said the wall could cover roughly half of the 2,000-mile border, with natural barriers such as mountains thwarting illegal immigrants elsewhere. The border already has 653 miles of fencing in the area where Trump envisions a wall, which would need approval from Congress. During the campaign, Mr. Trump estimated the wall would cost between $10 billion and $15 billion, without offering any specifics and repeatedly vowed Mexico would pay for it. Mexico has repeatedly said it won\u2019t pay. An analysis published in the MIT Technology Review said the president\u2019s estimate is \u201cbad math\u201d and pegged the wall\u2019s cost at as much as $40 billion. An analysis released by Bernstein Research\u2019s Roseberg last year reckoned the wall would need 7.1 million cubic metric tons of concrete and 2.4 million tons of cement. His forecast for the wall\u2019s\u00a0 cost is as much as $25 billion . Experts have questioned the need for a wall given that the number of people caught at the border has fallen in recent years. But more people may be tempted to try their luck this year because economic growth in Mexico is expected to decelerate to 1.8 percent, down 0.2 percentage points from an earlier forecast, according to Focus Economics . \u201cThe wall is almost a like a diversion,\u201d Wood said, adding that Mexico knows it can do little to stop it. However, \u201cThey\u2019ll continue to complain about it and say it\u2019s the wrong thing to do.\u201d With Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to renegotiate NAFTA and implement border taxes on imported goods sold in the U.S., the Mexican government has plenty of things to worry about. \u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

Midnight on the clock represents doomsday. The closer the minute hand is to midnight, the higher the chance of a global cataclysm, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, the group that sets the time on the symbolic clock. The clock's minute hand is assessed each year, and the clock's time \"conveys how close we are to destroying our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making,\" the Bulletin said on its website. The Bulletin's science and security board decided to advance the clock \"in part based on the words of a single person: Donald Trump, the new president of the United States,\" it said in a news release today. The board called Trump's comments about expanding the U.S. nuclear arsenal and his disbelief in climate change \"disturbing\" and said his \"statements and his actions as president-elect have broken with historical precedent in unsettling ways.\" Trump tweeted in December 2016 that the U.S. \"must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\" In January 2014, Trump said in a tweet , \"Global warming is an expensive hoax!\" and in November 2012, Trump claimed in a tweet that the \"concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" ",

President Donald Trump speaks during his meeting with automobile leaders on Jan. 24, 2017, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) Jeremy Gorner and Jason Meisner Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune An ABC News transcript of its interview with President Donald Trump on Wednesday quoted him as saying that two people were fatally shot in Chicago while his predecessor, Barack Obama , was giving his farewell speech at McCormick Place \u2014 a claim shown to be false by Police Department records. The passage in question was not included in the broadcast aired Wednesday night, but the network posted a longer transcript on its website that contained the remarks in question. An ABC spokesman confirmed to the Tribune on Thursday that the transcript accurately depicted the president's words, but the network did not immediately share the video with the Tribune. Not only did no homicides take place in Chicago during Obama's address of about an hour Jan. 10, but the official Police Department records and the Tribune's crime database show that no shootings at all occurred over that time frame. Trump apparently made the erroneous claim during an interview with ABC News anchor David Muir , who asked the president about the tweet he'd sent Tuesday that read: \"If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\" After once again characterizing Chicago as a war zone, Trump told Muir that two people had been fatally shot in the city during Obama's speech. He didn't say where or how he'd come across the information. Trump interview with David Muir David Muir interviews President Donald Trump.

Police records show no shootings took place during the speech. See more videos \"So, look, when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very nice speech,\" Trump said, according to the transcript of the interview. \"Two people were shot and killed during his speech. You can't have that. They weren't shot at the speech. But they were shot in the city of Chicago during his speech. What \u2014 what's going on?\" The city had no slayings for about 24 hours before and after Obama's speech, which lasted from 8:02 to 8:53 p.m. A man was shot about 20 minutes after the speech about eight miles away in the West Side's Lawndale neighborhood, but that victim survived, according to Police Department data. Calls and emails seeking comment from the White House media affairs office were not immediately returned. Trump, who campaigned on a law-and-order platform, has often cited Chicago's violence as an example of rampant urban crime that he would address as president. But like many of his comments on social media and in interviews, Trump's ruminations on the city's gun violence issue have often left more questions than answers. ",

    "text": "Republican leaders Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell said they are on the \"same page\" as the Trump administration when it comes to health care and ta... Spicer told reporters Thursday that the administration is considering \u201cusing comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico.\u201d The proposal is meant to raise the billions of dollars from Mexico needed to cover the cost of the border wall, a promise Mr. Trump has made since his days on the campaign trail.\u00a0 Mexican president cancels meeting with Trump after border wall executive order \u201cRight now our country\u2019s policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous,\u201d Spicer said. But \u201cif you tax that $50 billion at 20 percent of imports -- which is by the way a practice that 160 other countries do...By doing that, we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That\u2019s really going to provide the funding.\u201d Trump talks executive orders, agenda at GOP retreat in Philadelphia Trump\u2019s wall could benefit this Mexican company Later in the afternoon, however, Spicer and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters that the proposal was in fact just one of several options the White House was considering, including a border tax in the range of 5 - 20 percent. \u201cIt is part of a buffet of options,\u201d White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters, according to CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan. He said this is one of the many ways that the border wall could be funded. While Mr. Trump has publicly said he had already figured out how to pay for the wall, Spicer said he\u2019s now willing to work with Congress to find a way to do it. That includes making it a part of comprehensive tax reform like that being proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. White House officials said the proposed border tax would essentially be a way to derive payment from Mexico. When pressed as to whether this now meant that the Mexican government would not have to write a check to the U.S. to repay it for construction of the wall, Spicer stipulated that the president had never said that was going to happen. He made the point that there were multiple ways for Mexico \u2013 either via its corporations or other entities \u2013 to help fund the construction. The border adjustment act that Ryan has proposed would include a tax on goods produced outside the country for sale inside the U.S. In short it would incentivize corporations to produce their goods in the U.S. and sell them here instead of seeking a cheaper labor source outside the country. \u00a0Ryan\u2019s argument is that the corporate tax rate would be lowered to offset that increase in cost of doing business. He also argues that it would strengthen the dollar. In 2015, the U.S. suffered a $58.4 billion trade deficit with Mexico, its third largest trading partner.\u00a0 In a tweet early Wednesday, Mr. Trump lamented that \u201c$60 billion\u201d deficit.\u00a0 According to the U.S. Trade Representative, the top items exported by Mexico to the U.S. in 2015 were vehicles ($74 billion), electrical machinery ($63 billion) and machinery ($49 billion).\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear, however, who would bear the brunt of an import tax on Mexican goods. For instance, any border tax hike could potentially be passed on to American consumers. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was quick to point out that the U.S. isn\u2019t the only country that can impose an import tax. Border security yes, tariffs no. Mexico is 3rd largest trading partner. Any tariff we can levy they can levy. Huge barrier to econ growth /1 \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017 Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad. (2) \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017 On Wednesday, the president signed an executive order to begin \u201cthe immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border.\u201d\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Steven Portnoy contributed to this report. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

He says President Donald Trump will nominate a \"strict constructionist,\" or a jurist who supports a narrow reading of the US Constitution. (Jan. 26) AP Vice President Pence and Speaker Paul Ryan talk as President Trump speaks at the GOP congressional retreat in Philadelphia on Jan. 26, 2017. (Photo: Pool, Getty Images) 5015 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 103 COMMENTEMAILMORE PHILADELPHIA\u00a0\u2014 Vice President Pence told Republican members of Congress on Thursday to \"buckle up\" and get ready to work with the new Trump administration on everything from repealing Obamacare to confirming a \"strict constructionist\" to fill the Supreme Court. \"My friends, this is our moment,\" he told lawmakers at a GOP congressional retreat in downtown Philadelphia.. \"We got this far because President Donald Trump marshaled a movement unlike any movement in American history.\" Pence, a former congressman and Indiana governor, said the challenges facing Congress and the White House are large and urgent. \"President Trump and I will forge a strong working relationship with the Congress and with all of you to enact the laws that will serve the American people,\" the vice president said, promising not to \"bypass\" Congress as he accused the Obama administration of doing. \"We\u2019re all one party and we\u2019re all striving to achieve the same objective.\" In addition to writing a new health care law to replace the Affordable Care \u00a0Act, Pence said the administration's top goals are boosting military spending; improving and expanding America's highways, bridges, airports and public transit systems; and cutting government regulations. Congressional leaders have been talking about a nearly identical agenda at their retreat this week. Pence, who will be attending the March for Life anti-abortion event in Washington on Friday, said he he was especially happy that Trump signed an executive order restoring a ban on giving U.S. funds to international groups that provide or discuss abortion services. Pence\u00a0will become the highest-ranking government official to speak in person at the annual march. \"Just this week, this pro-life president reinstated the Mexico City policy banning public funding of abortion,\" he said. \"As another pro-life American, I couldn\u2019t be more proud.\" Pence said he was glad to be back in Pennsylvania, which gave Trump an upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. \"We owe Pennsylvania a debt of gratitude and thanks,\" he said. \"We also have to return the favor. We need to repay the hard working people of Pennsylvania and people everywhere who yearn for a better future.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called Pence \"the epitome of a happy warrior\" as he introduced the vice president at the retreat. \"Mike Pence is the glue that keeps us all together focused and fixed on our shared timelines and challenges,\" Ryan said. \"He makes all of us better.\" Read more: Posted!

And her analysis has drawn a swift rebuke from the current occupant of the White House, President Donald Trump. Although Manning, her family and many supporters are undoubtedly grateful that Obama dramatically reduced her sentence from its initial 35 years to just a few more months, plus time served, the former Army private still suggested that the ex-president's penchant for compromise with his political foes hamstrung his administration. \"For eight years, it did not matter how balanced President Obama was. It did not matter how educated he was, or how intelligent he was. Nothing was ever good enough for his opponents,\" Manning wrote in The Guardian . \"It was clear that he could not win. It was clear that, no matter what he did, in their eyes, he could not win.\" Related: President Obama Grants 330 Commutations in Historic Final Act \"The one simple lesson to draw from President Obama's legacy: do not start off with a compromise. They won't meet you in the middle. Instead, what we need is an unapologetic progressive leader,\" she added. Early on Thursday morning, Trump lashed out at Manning on Twitter, writing: \"Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!\" Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible! Ironically, Trump frequently called Obama \"weak\" (as well as a \"disaster,\" \"the worst president, maybe in the history our country\" and \"unfit to serve\") both prior to and during his campaign to succeed him. Trump also routinely questioned Obama's intelligence, patriotism and, for several years, his citizenship. Manning acknowledged that Obama left behind \"hints of a progressive legacy,\" and she wrote earnestly of the hope and optimism she felt during both of his elections. But she also lamented the fact that too many of his achievements were fleeting and that, in some cases (like his response to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando ) she believes the president was too slow to speak up for marginalized and ostracized communities. People hold signs calling for the release of imprisoned wikileaks whistleblower Chelsea Manning while marching in a gay pride parade in San Francisco, California June 28, 2015. Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters Her critical tone is a far cry from her past written pleas to the Obama administration for a pardon. After her initial attempt to be granted a reprieve was rejected three years ago, Manning admitted later her request had been \"too soon\" and \"too much.\" \"I should have waited. I needed time to absorb the conviction, and to reflect on my actions. I also needed time to grow and mature as a person,\" she wrote. Related: Chelsea Manning Again Attempts Suicide in Prison, Attorney Says The decision to commute Manning's sentence was one of the more divisive moves President Obama made in his final days in office. Although the majority of the public approved of his historic number of commutations of non-violent drug offenders , his choice to spare Manning was met with more resistance, particularly among Republicans. US President Barack Obama departs the Brady Press Briefing Room after his last press conference as president at the White House in Washington on Jan. 18, 2017. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA Obama defended his decision, which had been anticipated for some time, in his final press conference as president. \"Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence, so the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served,\" he told reporters . \"It has been my view that given she went to trial; that due process was carried out; that she took responsibility for her crime; that the sentence that she received was very disproportional \u2014 disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received; and that she had served a significant amount of time, that it made sense to commute and not pardon her sentence.\" NBC News reached out to the Obama Foundation to see if the former president had any further comment or reaction to Manning's column in The Guardian, but has not heard back at this time. Manning, who came out as transgender shortly after her sentencing, has made two suicide attempts in just the past year and gone on a hunger strike during her seven years in military prison. She has long sought what she considers proper treatment for the anxiety-producing condition, gender dysphoria. She is set to be released from prison on May 17. Adam Howard ",

Eight people were killed and more than 50 others were injured in the crash. Win McNamee, Getty Images Email PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The Amtrak engineer involved in a deadly crash in Philadelphia has sued Amtrak, saying it failed to address reports that people were throwing projectiles at trains.\u00a0 Brandon Bostian\u2019s attorney has said the engineer didn\u2019t remember anything after his train pulled out of the last stop before the derailment. \u00a0 LinkedIn Brandon Bostian says he was left disoriented or unconscious when something struck his train before the May 2015 crash. Federal investigators came to a different conclusion: that Bostian\u2019s train wasn\u2019t hit. They concluded Bostian instead was distracted over reports that a nearby train was struck and lost track of where he was. He accelerated to 106 mph as he approached a 50 mph curve. Amtrak has paid $265 million over claims filed on behalf of the eight people killed and more than 200 injured. Bostian says he suffered physical and psychological injuries that make it difficult for him to work. He is seeking more than $50,000. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The group took the \"unprecedented\" step of moving the clock 30 seconds closer to midnight, to leave it at 2 1/2 minutes away. The setting is the closest the clock has come to midnight since 1953, when scientists moved it to two minutes from midnight after seeing both the U.S. and the Soviet Union test hydrogen bombs. It remained at that mark until 1960. \"Make no mistake, this has been a difficult year,\" Rachel Bronson, executive director and publisher of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said as the new setting was announced Thursday. Explaining its move, the Bulletin's Science and Security Board said: \"Over the course of 2016, the global security landscape darkened as the international community failed to come effectively to grips with humanity's most pressing existential threats, nuclear weapons and climate change ... This already-threatening world situation was the backdrop for a rise in strident nationalism worldwide in 2016, including in a U.S. presidential campaign during which the eventual victor, Donald Trump, made disturbing comments about the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and expressed disbelief in the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change.\" Article continues after sponsorship The board criticized President Trump further , saying that \"even though he has just now taken office, the president's intemperate statements, lack of openness to expert advice, and questionable cabinet nominations have already made a bad international security situation worse.\" Last year, the Doomsday Clock's setting didn't change from 2015 , when it jumped two notches to three minutes before midnight \u2014 the closest it had been to midnight since the early era of above-ground hydrogen bomb testing. Created in 1947, the Doomsday Clock was conceived by scientists who had participated in the Manhattan Project. Initially seen as an indicator of the likelihood of disastrous nuclear conflict, it now also includes other threats , such as climate change, biological weapons and cyberthreats. It's the first time in the Doomsday Clock's 70-year history that the advisory board has adjusted the clock by 30 seconds. The decision to advance the clock was announced at the National Press Club, where speakers included board members former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Thomas R. Pickering and physicist Lawrence Krauss. A simultaneous event was held at Stanford University that featured California Gov. Jerry Brown, former Secretary of State George Schultz and former Defense Secretary William Perry. \"Facts are stubborn things,\" Krauss said, \"and they must be taken into account if the future of humanity is to be preserved.\" The Doomsday Clock, physicist Lawrence Krauss said at Thursday's event, offers \"a rare opportunity to reach the global public directly.\" Urging members of the public to speak to their political leaders, he added that important decisions about humanity's future shouldn't be left to a few men. \"President Trump and President Putin, who claim great respect for each other, can choose to act together as statesmen, or act as petulant children, risking our future,\" Krauss said. His direct comments sparked the first question after board members had made their initial statements, as Tracy Wilkinson of The Los Angeles Times asked Krauss, \"You said this shouldn't be left in the hands of one or two leaders making crazy statements. I know you mean Trump, but is the second person Putin?\" As Krauss answered yes, another panel member, Thomas Pickering, added, \"Good guess.\" ",

Veuer's Nick Cardona has the story. Buzz60 President Trump points to members of the media while sitting at his desk on Air Force One upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. on Jan. 26, 2017. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Trump's plan for a wall along the Mexican border could be financed through a 20% border tax on all imports from the United States' third largest trading partner, the White House said Thursday. \u201cIt clearly provides the funding and does so in a way that the American taxpayer is wholly respected,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.\u00a0\u201cWe are probably the only major country that doesn\u2019t treat imports this way.\u201d But shortly after he announced the proposal in an unscheduled\u00a0\"gaggle\" with reporters on Air Force One, Spicer clarified to a separate group of reporters in the West Wing that it was just one proposal.\u00a0\"There are clearly a bunch of ways it can be done,\" he said.\u00a0\"The point is American taxpayers are not going to fund it.\" White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus added that it was part of a \"buffet of options.\" The unexpected proposal and subsequent backtracking\u00a0underscored just how quickly the Trump White House is churning out policy proposals in a hectic first week\u00a0in office, with a crowded calendar of meetings, speeches and executive actions. The border tax plan would need congressional approval, and Spicer described it as the beginning of a process that would be part of overall tax reform. The tax proposal would have the benefit of dovetailing two of his signature policies:\u00a0Curtailing illegal immigration and enacting more protectionist trade regulations. But the proposal could face resistance even among Republicans. \"Border security yes, tariffs no,\" Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., wrote on Twitter.\u00a0\"Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad.\" CLOSE x Share Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump will seek a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for a proposed border wall.   (Jan. 26) AP The U.S. trade deficit with Mexico is was $49.2 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Trade Representative . Though Spicer didn't explain how the tax would work, the principle is similar to a border adjustment tax currently being discussed in Congress, which would heavily tax imports but give a tax credit on exports. \u201cRight now our country\u2019s policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous,\" Spicer said. Spicer ran through the math by applying 20% to the difference, coming up with nearly $10 billion a year. The United States could \"easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That\u2019s really going to provide the funding,\u201d he said. Actual imports from Mexico totaled\u00a0$316.4 billion in 2015. Read more: Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Got it (The Washington Post) By Anne Gearan and Karen DeYoung By Anne Gearan and Karen DeYoung January 26 at 7:11 PM Follow @agearan Follow @karendeyoung1 A number of career Foreign Service officers were informed this week that they will not be asked to stay on in senior or sensitive posts that are under direct White House control, creating an unusual leadership vacuum among the top ranks of the State Department. Although the diplomats were not technically fired, the Trump administration opted to remove a number of top officials in charge of the State Department\u2019s 13 divisions responsible for policy and other matters. Officials at the level of assistant secretary and above were affected, the department said. Trump\u2019s choice to be secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is expected to be confirmed as soon as Monday and to be on the job next week. The White House is expected to name a deputy for Tillerson within a few days. The leading candidates are Republican foreign policy specialists who are not serving in government. One and two levels below that rank, the State Department is run by a mix of career diplomats and outside policy experts or political operatives who all serve at the pleasure of the White House. In past administrations, many career diplomats have remained in their posts when the White House changed hands. The Trump administration has opted to retain fewer than usual, State Department officials said, although it was not immediately clear whether it is a majority. Officials said the White House had accepted a \u201chandful\u201d of resignations this week, the first full workweek of the new administration, while deferring action on others. A U.S. flag and its shadow on the Harry S. Truman Building at the State Department in Washington in October 2014. (Larry Downing/Reuters) Separately, at the Department of Homeland Security, officials said Thursday that the chief of the U.S. Border Patrol was resigning after six months on the job, one day after Trump announced plans to ratchet up immigration enforcement and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. At the State Department, all career diplomats running those offices, called bureaus, had submitted pro forma resignations that were effective upon the end of the Obama administration, spokesman Mark Toner said. \u201cThese positions are political appointments, and require the president to nominate and the Senate to confirm them in these roles. They are not career appointments, but of limited term,\u201d Toner said. \u201cNo [Foreign Service] officer accepts a political appointment with the expectation that it is unlimited. And all officers understand that the president may choose to replace them at any time.\u201d In some cases, top diplomats are retiring rather than seek new assignments elsewhere at the State Department. Patrick F. Kennedy, the undersecretary for management at the State Department across several presidential administrations, was not asked to stay. Kennedy announced that his last day will be Friday. The 44-year State Department veteran is retiring, following veteran diplomats overseeing the department\u2019s operations in the Mideast and Europe, among other places. Former senior officials said Kennedy had wanted to remain in his post. He declined a request for comment. Kennedy has overseen a vast array of State Department activity, including budget, personnel and Freedom of Information requests. His domain included diplomatic security during the 2012 attacks at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, and the records and IT departments during the period when Hillary Clinton was using a public server as secretary of state. As as result, he was called to explain the State Department\u2019s actions before House and Senate committees investigating Benghazi and the Clinton emails. Three senior officials who worked closely with Kennedy also resigned this week, including Gentry Smith, who directs the Office of Foreign Missions. All had been considered likely to stay on at least temporarily. Gregory Starr, the assistant secretary for diplomatic security, retired on Inauguration Day. The assistant secretaries in charge of counterterrorism and other specialties were asked to leave, as was the acting secretary in charge of Latin America. Victoria Nuland, who had been the top diplomat in charge of U.S. policy in Europe and Eurasia, resigned ahead of the inauguration. Her last day was last week, and her State Department biography page no longer works. She is also retiring from the Foreign Service after a career that included stints as ambassador to NATO and department spokeswoman, as well as foreign policy adviser to former vice president Dick Cheney. Nuland was known as a fierce critic of Russia, especially throughout the political upheaval in Ukraine that began in 2013 and Russia\u2019s subsequent annexation of Crimea. She was loathed by Moscow, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov complaining about her by name. She was the subject of threats and harassment, including, she claimed, a Russian leak of an intercepted phone call between her and the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, in which she said \u201cF--- the E.U.\u201d Anne Patterson, a former ambassador to Pakistan and Egypt, retired as assistant secretary for the Mideast several weeks ago. Both she and Nuland have voiced views significantly at odds with Trump administration policy positions. The career diplomats in charge of Asia and Africa were still in their positions as of Thursday with no immediate plans to leave. William Brownfield, assistant secretary for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, is also apparently staying for the time being. And a number of the assistant secretary positions \u2014 tasked with overseeing certain geographic areas and issues \u2014 are now held by acting heads. \u201cWhile this appears to be a large turnover in a short period of time, a change of administration always brings personnel \u00adchanges, and there is nothing unusual about rotations or retirements in the Foreign Service,\u201d said the American Foreign Service Association\u2019s president, Barbara Stephenson. \u201cRotations to new positions and retirements after a fixed number of years of service are part of the DNA of the Foreign Service. Have no doubt that the next generation of leaders is eager to step up and serve, ensuring the continuity of this great institution.\u201d But current and former senior officials were clear that the turnover is unusual even for a new administration, a natural point of retirement or resignation for many career civil servants and diplomats. Generally, a career diplomat will stay in place \u201cuntil your successor is chosen, then you either petition for another job,\u201d one former senior official said, \u201cor they say we just don\u2019t see a way to use you and you quietly retire later.\u201d Added the official: \u201cAnd then there are the people who would have stayed to wait and see. And now, they\u2019re starting to see.\u201d The former official spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the Trump administration. Tillerson held meetings at the State Department this week. He had canceled a planned dinner before the inauguration with John F. Kerry, the outgoing secretary, and met only once with State Department counselor Thomas Shannon, who has been serving as acting secretary and is staying on.

    "text": "By christina capatides CBS News January 26, 2017, 2:36 PM Madeleine Albright says she's \"ready to register as Muslim in #solidarity\" WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 03:  Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright delivers remarks during the ceremonial groundbreaking of the future U.S. Diplomacy Center at the State Department\u2019s Harry S. Truman Building September 3, 2014 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images Email In response to reports that President Trump could soon sign an executive action that would immigration from some predominantly Muslim countries, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tweeted in protest. Mr. Trump has remained true to several of his controversial\u00a0 campaign promises , signing executive actions that withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, imposing a hiring freeze on all federal civilian employees, excluding military personnel, directing government agencies to phase out as many components of Obamacare as possible as lawmakers work on the initial process of dismantling former president\u2019s signature healthcare law. During his campaign, Mr. Trump promised to enforce \u201cextreme vetting\u201d and suspend immigration from certain Muslim countries, so it would not be surprising if he were to issue an executive action on Muslims entering the U.S., aimed at bolstering national security. And now, former Secretary of State Albright is saying that she is prepared to register as Muslim if that happens. I was raised Catholic, became Episcopalian & found out later my family was Jewish. I stand ready to register as Muslim in #solidarity . \u2014 Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) January 25, 2017 In a tweet posted at 10:18 a.m. Wednesday, Albright wrote, \u201cI was raised Catholic, became Episcopalian & found out later my family was Jewish. I stand ready to register as Muslim in #solidarity.\u201d As of this article\u2019s publication, the tweet has more than 46,000 likes and more than 20,000 retweets. Within moments of the tweet mentioned above, Albright further emphasized her message by tweeting a photo of the statue of liberty, emblazoned with the words, \u201c \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d There is no fine print on the Statue of Liberty. America must remain open to people of all faiths & backgrounds. #RefugeesWelcome pic.twitter.com/4LvMiZTRJJ \u2014 Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) January 25, 2017 \u201cThere is no fine print on the Statue of Liberty. America must remain open to people of all faiths & backgrounds. #refugeeswelcome,\u201d she added. \u00a0 Albright herself came to the U.S. as a child after her family fled Nazi persecution in Europe, so this is an issue close to her heart. She, however, is not the only public figure tweeting this sort of message in solidarity with Muslim immigrants. On Wednesday, \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d star Mayim Bialik also tweeted in protest to a potential executive order, \u201cI\u2019m Jewish. I stand ready to register as a Muslim in #solidarity  if it comes to that.\u201d I'm Jewish. I stand ready to register as a Muslim in #solidarity if it comes to that. \u2014 Mayim Bialik (@missmayim) January 25, 2017 Susan Rice, the 27th U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted today as well: \u201cThis is nuts. Thousands of innocents who would enrich our nation now left to rot in camps/die in war zones across the world. #Solidarity\u201d This is nuts.

Got it By Matea Gold and Alice Crites By Matea Gold and Alice Crites January 26 at 1:49 PM Follow @mateagold Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, is currently registered to vote in New Jersey and New York. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and one of his closest White House advisers, is registered to vote in both New Jersey and New York, while White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is on the rolls both in Virginia and his home state of Rhode Island,\u00a0according to elections officials and voting registration records. Their dual registrations offer two more high-profile examples of how common it is for voters to be on the rolls in multiple states -- something Trump has claimed is evidence of voter fraud. Along with Kushner and Spicer,\u00a0The Washington Post has now identified five Trump family members or top administration appointees who were registered in two states during the fall election. The others are chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon ; Tiffany Trump, the president's youngest daughter; and Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin, as first reported by CNN. [ Stephen Bannon was registered to vote in two states \u2014 despite his efforts to take himself off the rolls in Florida ] White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Trump said this week that the fact that many voters are registered in two states is a sign of widespread voter fraud, calling for a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d into his unsubstantiated claim that millions of people cast illegal ballots in November. \u201cYou have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states,\u201d the president told \u00a0ABC's David Muir on Wednesday. \u201cYou have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion.\u201d [ Trump to sign executive order related to voter fraud ] It is not illegal to be registered to vote in two states, and elections officials say that does not mean voters are casting ballots in two locations. In fact, it is quite common for out-of-date registrations to linger on the rolls, due to voters dying or moving to new jurisdictions. A\u00a0 2012 Pew Center on the States study \u00a0that Trump has erroneously cited as evidence of voter fraud found that about 2.75 million people were registered in more than one state \u2014 largely because voters did not report when they moved to new jurisdictions. During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that widespread voter fraud is a belief President Trump has \"maintained for a while.\" (Reuters) \u201cIt's not fraud,\u201d said John Lindback, executive director of the\u00a0Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a nonprofit organization that works with states to improve the accuracy of their voting rolls. \u201cWhen people move from one state to another or move down the street, they don\u2019t think to change their voter registration.\u201d That appears to be what happened in the case of Kushner, who married Trump's daughter Ivanka in October 2009. New Jersey voting records show that he registered to vote there in 1999 and cast ballots in New Jersey through the November 2009 state general election, when now-Gov. Chris Christie (R) was on the ballot for his first race. Later that month, Kushner registered in New York at his Park Avenue address. Voting records show he began casting ballots in New York in 2010. Representatives for Kushner did not respond to requests for comment. Spicer last voted in Rhode Island in 1998, according to state records, which means his registration should have been declared inactive or removed by now. But the Rhode Island Board of Elections confirmed to the Post that he is still listed as having an active voter registration. Since September 1999, Spicer has also been registered to vote in Alexandria, Va., according to elections officials there. In the case of Bannon, he was registered until this week in both New York and Florida, despite his efforts to remove himself from the rolls in the latter. Mnuchin is registered in both New York, where he last voted in 2008, and in California, where he cast his ballot in November, election records show. And Tiffany Trump, the president's daughter, is registered in New York and Pennsylvania, where she was attending college until May. On Thursday, White House senior adviser Kellyanne\u00a0Conway disputed that Tiffany Trump held dual registrations, telling NBC's \u201cToday\u201d that the president's youngest daughter told her \u201cit is flatly false that she is registered in two states.\u201d But elections officials said voters often do not realize they stay on the rolls after they have moved out of a jurisdiction. One major reason that out-of-date registrations are not always flagged is that less than half the states participate in ERIC, a cooperative that was created after the 2012 Pew study to help make voter rolls more accurate and comprehensive. Members of the group, which currently includes 20 states and the District of Columbia, are required to share their voter registration data every 60 days. The nonprofit group uses that data \u2014 along with information from state motor vehicle departments, the Social Security death index and the U.S. Postal Service's national change of address list \u2014 to match and update voter files. In 2016, it identified about\u00a0 2 million voters who had moved, passed away or had duplicate registrations. \u201cBefore ERIC was formed, it was much worse,\u201d Lindback said. But he noted that some of the most populous\u00a0states, including California, Florida and New York, do not participate.\u00a0If more states join,\"the number of cases will go way down,\u201d he added. Lindback, who previously served as Oregon's director of elections, said he\u00a0is hopeful that\u00a0Trump's focus on dual registrations could help encourage more states to exchange data. But he said he's concerned that the president's debunked claims that millions of illegal votes were cast in November could \u201chave\u00a0the effect of reducing confidence in how our elections are run.\u201d \u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d he added. \u201cI have been in elections a lot of years, and it's usually the loser of an election who claims fraud. I\u2019ve never seen a winner claim fraud. What is going on here?\u201d This post has been updated. politics ",

They will serve as a rifleman, machine gunner and mortar Marine. Anklam said female Marines deployed to conflict zones have shared tents with their male counterparts at times. But this marks the first time female Marines will be doing so during their regular training with their combat unit. Their entry into the unit was part of efforts to comply with the Pentagon\u2019s directive in December 2015 to open all military jobs to women. That decision also formally recognized the thousands of female servicewomen who fought in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, including those who were killed or wounded. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Republicans Eye 'Once In A Generation' Chance At Tax Overhaul The agenda will test the party's commitment to small government and a fiscal conservatism that in recent years has rejected any new spending without corresponding cuts in the federal budget. Trump's promises to expand health care coverage and spend more on the nation's ailing infrastructure systems \u2014 while cutting taxes for businesses and individuals \u2014 will be hard to reconcile with competing GOP commitments to balance the budget and reduce the nation's debt burden. Nearly all congressional Republicans are self-described fiscal conservatives. But Trump has shown support for vast new federal spending \u2014 like that $1 trillion infrastructure proposal \u2014 and an indifference to deficit spending if it can spur U.S. economic growth. For instance, Republicans largely agree that tax cuts do not need to be paid for and consider them economic stimulus. Ryan would not say Republican policies won't increase the deficit in the short term, but he reiterated a long-standing commitment to paying for new spending. \"We are fiscal conservatives. If we're going to be spending on things like say, infrastructure, we're going to find the fiscal space to pay for that in our spring budget,\" he said, referring to the annual budget resolution. Republicans are already working to provide Trump with $12 billion to $15 billion in new spending to fund his call to finish a border wall with Mexico. Congress is expected to use an upcoming defense supplemental spending bill to include new border funds. The supplemental spending bill is considered \"emergency\" spending and does not require spending offsets. Ryan and McConnell declined to answer repeated questions about whether the wall would be offset in the federal budget. Trump has insisted Mexico will reimburse the U.S. for the costs, through undetermined new measures affecting trade and tax policy with Mexico. Article continues after sponsorship Leaders say they are on the \"same page\" as the Trump administration on an agenda that has expanded to the first 200 days in part to accommodate extra scheduling burdens in the Senate related to the confirmation process for Trump's Cabinet and an upcoming Supreme Court nominee. Ryan and McConnell struck a more cautious tone to reporters on their timeline for moving legislation. \"We don't want to set arbitrary deadlines on things. We want to get things right,\" Ryan said. \"The speaker understands the challenges of getting things through the Senate,\" McConnell added. \"That's been true for 240 years. But we're aware of those challenges and we think we can move forward.\" However, in a presentation to lawmakers on Wednesday leaders outlined a 2017 program that included a specific timeline, including: Repeal and replace legislation for Obamacare to President Trump by early April A defense and border supplemental funding bill by April An infrastructure bill by early summer A tax overhaul and revamp of the IRS by August Congress also wants to pass laws affecting federal flood insurance, veterans health care and financial regulations by the end of the year. Lawmakers are also anticipating further executive actions from the Trump administration on immigration and health care. The ambitious agenda is being pushed by Trump, who has told lawmakers he wants quick action on his priorities. \"President Trump comes from a different world,\" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters. \"Out in the business community, he likes things done fast, and he's going to continue to push them.\" On Thursday, the president did. \"We have to deliver,\" he told lawmakers. \"This is our change to make major and lasting change.\" ",

    "text": "(Soumya Karlamangla) \u201cThe fact is we have a considerable number of people in the party who aren\u2019t that interested in covering the uninsured,\u201d said John Goodman, a health economist who has been working with a group of GOP lawmakers on an alternative to Obamacare that would preserve the law\u2019s financial aid. Preserving that assistance is gaining support among Republican elected officials, who now face the prospect that millions of their constituents suddenly could become uninsured if Obamacare is fully rolled back\u00a0without a viable alternative. Over the last several weeks, GOP governors whose states have expanded their Medicaid programs through the law \u2014\u00a0including Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio and Massachusetts \u2014\u00a0have voiced opposition to federal Medicaid cuts.\u00a0 And Tuesday, the bipartisan National Governors\u2019 Assn. sent a letter to House Republicans warning against any healthcare proposals that would saddle states with a greater share of Medicaid costs. At the same time, a new Obamacare alternative that would largely retain funding in the current law and give states the option to maintain Obamacare\u2019s coverage system or design something else is gaining support in the Senate. The legislation, authored by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), now has the backing of\u00a0Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). \u201cWe hope that our approach will expand the number of people who are covered,\u201d Collins told CNN this week. The GOP interest in preserving coverage reflects public opinion. While Obamacare remains deeply divisive, many of its key provisions are\u00a0popular, even among Trump supporters. Eight in 10 Americans in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll \u00a0support federal aid to states to help them expand Medicaid coverage for the poor. A similar majority back the law\u2019s system of insurance marketplaces \u2014\u00a0such as HealthCare.gov \u2014\u00a0where people who don\u2019t get coverage through an employer can shop for health plans and get subsidies to offset their premiums. At the same time, a growing share of Americans say the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that all Americans have healthcare coverage.\u00a0Six in 10 backed this view in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center , up from 42% in 2013. The rise in support has been particularly pronounced among low- and middle-income Republicans, Pew found. But the divides within the GOP remain deep. Conservative lawmakers, such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), are still demanding Obamacare\u2019s taxes be rolled back, which would make it virtually impossible to maintain coverage. And the Cassidy and Collins health plan has received a cool reception from some conservatives. \u201cThe Patient Freedom Act, as introduced, replaces Obamacare with ... Obamacare,\u201d Jason Pye, director of\u00a0public policy at the advocacy group FreedomWorks said in a blog post this week . \u201cIf Republicans are serious about repealing Obamacare, they, you know, actually have to do it. Introducing a bill that effectively preserves Obamacare does nothing to further this effort.\u201d For his part, Trump hasn\u2019t weighed in on the debate within his party. But he continues to offer sweeping promises. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a much better health plan at much less money,\u201d the president told ABC News on Tuesday. \u201cWe will unleash something\u00a0that\u2019s going to be terrific.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Mary Tyler Moore \u00a0was a beloved TV icon who symbolized the independent career woman.

He declared that the crisis on the border was due to a surge in Central Americans. During the presidential campaign, Trump's inflammatory rhetoric included calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and accusing them of \"bringing crime.\" But Trump has also been threatening to reopen NAFTA, the trade agreement between Mexico, Canada and the U.S., to get a \"better deal.\" He made that along with other trade deals the culprit for manufacturing job losses and other economic ills in the U.S. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner . Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, expressed concerns over the Trump's positioning on NAFTA. \"I'm deeply concerned by President Trump's statements today reaffirming his commitment to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),\" McCain said. \"While re-negotiations could help to strengthen and modernize NAFTA to benefit American businesses and consumers, any effort to restrict or impose new barriers on our ability to trade with Mexico and Canada could jeopardize the future of this trade agreement and have serious consequences for Arizona and the country.\" Nieto had expressed interest in exploring the renegotiation of the 1994 agreement that predates advances in social media, telecommunications and other industries, to modernize it. Both leaders face record low approval ratings. Just 38 percent of Americans held a positive view of Trump when he took office last week, while 48 percent have a negative one. This makes him one of the least popular incoming presidents in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll . Nieto's own rating is very low in his home country. Just 12 percent of Mexicans approve of the job he's doing, according to the most recent poll by the Mexican newspaper Reforma. The most recent backlash he's faced is over soaring gasoline prices. The border line between Mexico and the U.S in the community of Sasabe in Sonora state, Mexico, on Jan. 13, 2017. Alfredo Estrella / AFP - Getty Images Facing some pressure at home and clearly disliking the orders from Trump, Nieto said in Spanish in a video posted on social media that Trump's wall was dividing the two nations. Jon Farela, CEO of the Borderplex Alliance, a business border development group, spent this week, speaking and visiting with members of Congress to provide evidence of how NAFTA has benefited both counties and areas for improvement. \"The quickest and surest way to destabilize the border is to remove jobs and hope because people will always find ways to provide for their families,\" said Farela, a conservative Republican and former New Mexico secretary of economic development who narrowly lost a congressional race in Albuquerque. Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Nieto had no other choice but to pull out of the visit with Trump, to do otherwise would appear to be kowtowing to Trump's threats. Trump's goading of Mexico \"is going to be extremely dangerous to U.S.-Mexico relations,\" Alden said. \"Mexico is a proud sovereign country, to have the president of the United States bully Mexico into submission is not going to go over well.\" Halimah Abdullah ",

    "text": "Avian Flu Outbreaks Raise Concerns About Possible Pandemic By Gillian Mohney Jan 26, 2017, 5:46 PM ET 0 Shares Star Remy Gabalda/AFP/Getty Images Duck farmers drive birds out of an enclosure as they prepare to slaughter a portion of the farm's 32,000 ducks, in Belloc-Saint-Clamens, southwestern France, Jan. 6, 2017, after the detection of bird flu. 0 Shares Email An avian flu outbreak in the U.K. is just the latest to erupt across the globe, worrying health experts about the possibility that the virus could become more widespread. Today U.K. officials confirmed a fifth area in the country has been hit with the H5N8 strain of the avian flu, since December. The strain has been spread from wild birds to farmed poultry, but has yet to affect humans, according to the U.K. Department of the Environment. There have been more than 40 countries reporting outbreaks of different strains of the avian flu since last November, according to World Health Organization officials. With the new avian flu outbreaks popping up in recent months, health experts have been increasingly concerned that one or more of the various strains of avian flu could mutate, increasing the risk of a dangerous new flu that could spread quickly across the globe. Normally the virus spreads among birds, often transmitted long distances by wild birds that migrate. In rare cases people in close contact to the birds become ill and the virus rarely spreads from person to person. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the public health community is increasingly concerned that the virus could potentially mutate. \"The concern always is that they could pick up a gene that permits that kind of flu to spread readily from person to person,\" Schaffner said. Currently \"bird flu by itself cannot do that.\" What You Need to Know About Uterus Transplants However, Schaffner said in recent years the medical community has developed better surveillance technology to find new outbreaks more easily. \"We detect more of the outbreaks and characterize them even more precisely than 10 years ago,\" he explained. On Monday, World Health Organization said they were on \"high alert\" due to the avian flu outbreaks and the possibility of mutation. During an address to the WHO executive board on Monday, WHO Director Margaret Chan explained one form of the virus first detected in humans in 2015 was created \"by gene-swapping among four different viruses.\" She urged all countries to closely watch for avian flu cases in both birds and humans to stop any new easily transmitted strain of the virus from spreading. \"We cannot afford to miss the early signals,\" Chan said. Multiple strains of the avian flu have spread through a diverse range of countries in recent months including Algeria, Finland , China and the United Kingdom, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. While the avian flu rarely affects people, it can have devastating consequences when it does. In China the mortality rate has hovered around 38 percent for the more than 1,000 people infected with a strain of avian flu since 2013, according to Chan. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "But a new sense of urgency, anxiety and maybe a little envy has accompanied this year\u2019s event, with anti-abortion organizers suddenly realizing they had a tough act to follow. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe\u2019re definitely pulling out all the stops this year to try to get people to come,\u201d said Amelia Irvine, president of Georgetown Right to Life at Georgetown University in Washington. National organizers of the March for Life said that while they were hopeful of a large turnout on Friday, they did not have any way to gauge how many would attend. This year\u2019s event will have two major draws : Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, who managed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and is now a White House counselor, are scheduled to speak. No president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. Last year, many marchers were deterred by a snowstorm that trapped some buses en route and stranded some marchers in town for days afterward. Organizers said that since so many had to cancel last year, there is pent-up energy this year. One of the largest turnouts was in 2013, the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the march itself. Some abortion opponents claimed that as many as 650,000 marchers showed up. But for this and every year, the March for Life organization itself played it conservative, estimating that the marchers numbered in \u201cthe tens of thousands.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that these numbers are the most important,\u201d said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, in a telephone interview. \u201cThe number most important for us is 58 million, which is the number of Americans that have been lost to abortion.\u201d Photo Members of an anti-abortion group met at the University of Notre Dame. Credit Taylor Glascock for The New York Times She said that calls and emails began pouring into March for Life\u2019s offices last Sunday from women who are opposed to abortion and were disturbed to see the strong abortion rights message coming from the stage of the women\u2019s march in Washington. \u201cWe are hearing from a lot of women who felt like their voices weren\u2019t represented last weekend,\u201d said Mrs. Mancini, who called in volunteers to handle the deluge. But it is unclear whether that anger will translate into attendance at the March for Life. Though many marchers come to the city by car or train, one gauge of expected attendance \u2014 bus parking permits \u2014 suggests the event will be smaller than last weekend\u2019s women\u2019s march. As of Wednesday only 92 permits had been issued for the March for Life, according to Events DC and the city\u2019s Department of Transportation, which handle the permits. Some 1,800 permits were issued for the women\u2019s march, and 450 for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the transportation department said. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

    "text": "By Joe Heim By Joe Heim January 26 at 11:27 AM Follow @JoeHeim Kellyanne Conway is counselor to President Trump. (Jesse Dittmar/For The Washington Post) When Kellyanne Conway took over as Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign manager in August \u2014 his third in under a year \u2014 there were few signs that Trump would emerge victorious on election night just three months later. He was trailing Hillary Clinton in some polls by 10 points nationally, and the gap was widening in battleground states. Twitter attacks by Trump on Khizr Khan, the father of an American Muslim Army captain killed in Iraq, and his metastasizing list of other Twitter and campaign rally barbs weren\u2019t helping his favorability ratings, particularly among women. Conway was known in political circles for her research firm, the Polling Company/WomanTrend, which she launched in 1995 in part to provide candidates and companies with studies and analysis of the concerns and aspirations of American women. Even though she had criticized Trump on numerous occasions earlier in the year, Conway was seen as someone who could bring discipline to the first-time candidate. And as a longtime Republican strategist and pollster with experience working for male candidates (Newt Gingrich, Ted Cruz, Mike Pence) who had trouble appealing to women voters, she was seen by politicos as well-suited to help Trump\u2019s troubled bid. Conway, who turned 50 on Inauguration Day, now serves as counselor to the president in the White House, where she immediately made news defending what she called \u201c alternative facts \u201d related to inauguration attendance. [ In his first major TV interview as president, Trump is endlessly obsessed with his popularity ] The only child of a single mother, Conway grew up in a working-class household in Atco, N.J. She has long-standing ties to Washington, having graduated from Trinity Washington University and George Washington University Law School. She and her husband, George, have four children. This interview took place at Trump Tower a week before the inauguration. How would you describe the past six months for you? The past six months for me, professionally, have been the apex of my career. People say, \u201cCongratulations, Kellyanne. You\u2019re successful because you work hard.\u201d I do work hard, but so many people, so many women in this country work hard. But they don\u2019t often get what I got, which was my shot and my time to help manage and execute on a plan and a vision at the highest levels of politics and government. And that\u2019s very rewarding to me because in many ways my life in the last six months really reflects the American Dream writ large. I was raised by a single mom, in a unconventional household of four Italian Catholic women, and I was the first person to go to college, let alone law school, in my family. I started my business at 28. Like a Generation Xer, I married later, had children later and was very focused on my career. I\u2019m a granddaughter of immigrants, and it\u2019s a very common American experience. But the last six months have been exhausting, exhilarating, heady and roller-coaster-like in terms of all the situations and circumstances that just come our way constantly when you\u2019re on Team Trump. At the same time there was a certain steadiness and composure and decorum and calmness that I\u2019ve experienced. Part of that is age/wisdom, and part of that is trying to be an anchor in the storm. The storm being not the campaign or Mr. Trump, the storm being all of the situational, circumstantial incoming that we constantly took. Conway at Trump Tower in New York. (Jesse Dittmar/For The Washington Post) You mentioned your mother. On election night did she say anything to you? She told me for weeks and months before election night that Donald Trump would win. But on election night she told me what she\u2019s been telling me my entire life, which is, basically, be yourself, have fun and accept whatever God has coming. When you hear that from your mother, \u201cAccept what God has coming,\u201d that has to be everything from a broken relationship or a broken heart when you\u2019re younger to not gaining entry into your reach college to burying a loved one unexpectedly. But my mother telling me that for years also made me see what a blessing and opportunity it was for Donald Trump to ask me to be his campaign manager. How big a deal is it to you that you were the first female campaign manager to win a presidential election? It\u2019s a bigger deal now in retrospect. I never gave it much thought during the campaign. And neither did Donald Trump. The day that we discussed this role of campaign manager , he never said, \u201cHey, this will be great. I\u2019ll make history with the first Republican female campaign manager.\u201d He never said this will help with women\u2019s votes \u2014 he never said any of that. So I appreciate very much that I was promoted based on skills and vision and compatibility with him. And him knowing that I would respectfully execute on his vision. This is his candidacy, this is his voice, his choice, and I\u2019m just one member of an amazing team to help execute on that. But looking back, I feel the enormity of that moment in time, mainly because of all the people I\u2019ve heard from. I consider myself more passionate than emotional, but it is nothing short of moving to hear from women and girls from all over the country and from men who say, \u201cMy daughters think you\u2019re a role model.\u201d You don\u2019t consider yourself a feminist? I don\u2019t consider myself a feminist. I think my generation isn\u2019t a big fan of labels. My favorite label is mommy. I feel like the feminist movement has been hijacked by the pro-abortion movement or the anti-male sentiments that you read in some of their propaganda and writings. I\u2019m not anti-male. One does not need to be pro-female and call yourself a feminist, when with it comes that whole anti-male culture where we want young boys to sit down and shut up in the classroom. And we have all of these commercials that show what a feckless boob the man in the house is. That\u2019s not the way I see the men in my life, most especially my 12-year-old son. I consider myself a postfeminist. I consider myself one of those women who is a product of her choices, not a victim of her circumstances. Have you talked to your father since the election? Oh, many times. What\u2019s your relationship with him? My father left when I was very young. I didn\u2019t meet him until I was 12 or 13. We had no alimony, no child support. He went on to have another family. He\u2019s been married four times. [Now] he\u2019s an active part of our lives, in part because he wants that, and in part because he deserves that. My operating principle as a typical Generation Xer, a child of divorce, is that you don\u2019t pass that on to the next generation. If there\u2019s hurt or there\u2019s pain or there\u2019s regret or there\u2019s been anger and sadness, there\u2019s no reason to pass that on. Conway and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort during a roundtable discussion on security at Trump Tower in August. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters) Did you have to go through a difficult period to come to terms with that, or has that always been true for you? No. I think when I see my husband\u2019s positive and loving relationship with our three daughters, and we have a son, I realize the unspoken scourge of paternal rejection. And how that had a negative impact on some of my earlier choices and certainly circumstances. But as I age and have more wisdom and seasoning and self-confidence, the positive effect of that is to recognize how nice it is that my daughters have constant paternal reaffirmation and love. But it\u2019s also made me independent. And maybe healthily skeptical of some people and situations. I didn\u2019t get married until I was 34, and I had been very independent, started my own business, paid off my student loans, had lived on my own since I was 18. In the early part of last year, you were very critical of Donald Trump. You called his supporters \u201cdownright nasty.\u201d You said Trump built his businesses on \u201cthe backs of the little guy.\u201d You said he should release his tax returns, said his language was unpresidential. So why did you decide in July to join his campaign? Well, those are cherry-picked comments. There\u2019s also an entire body of evidence that I always have supported him, thought he added a great deal to the political conversation and to giving people more hope and the freshest alternative to conventional politics that they told pollsters for 30 years that they wanted. Yes, but when you said \u2014 Yeah, those were situational. You have to understand something. I grew up around Atlantic City. My mother worked there for 21 years, and that was our sole source of support. She was left with no alimony, no child support whatsoever when I was 2 or 3. When the casinos came to Atlantic City, and that included Donald Trump and others, it revitalized an entire corridor between Atlantic City and Philadelphia. People then had jobs and benefits and opportunities, and I benefited directly from that through my mother and other family members. And I don\u2019t think he should release his tax returns now that I know more than I knew when I made that comment, which is that he\u2019s under audit. And he has been advised by his accountants and his lawyers to not release them. And I know firsthand as a pollster that Americans are much more interested in knowing what their tax returns will look like when he\u2019s president than in seeing his tax returns. [A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 74 percent of Americans believe Trump should release his tax returns, with 41 percent saying they care \u201ca lot\u201d that he does so.] Conway with Mike Pence, Charlotte Pence, Reince Priebus and Donald Trump outside Lamington Presbyterian Church after attending services in Bedminster Township, N.J., in late November. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) You co-wrote a book, \u201c What Women Really Want: How American Women Are Quietly Erasing Political, Racial, Class, and Religious Lines to Change the Way We Live .\u201d Ten years later, have those lines been erased, or are they bolder than they\u2019ve ever been? For some women they\u2019ve been erased because women of all races and ethnic backgrounds, age groups, socioeconomic status, geographic differences, all work together. They share a common love of this country and the elation/struggles of what it means to be a woman in 2017. But for some women and for people who cover women or speak about women, those lines are somewhat bolder and brighter. I think in politics they seem brighter and bolder. But in everyday parlance, everyday culture, that\u2019s just not true. We\u2019re the peacemakers, we\u2019re the great negotiators, the leaders and the managers of our households, of our workplaces. But why is that not being played out in politics? Because politics goes for the heat and not the light most of the time. Politics looks at division and subtraction, not at addition and multiplication. It\u2019s congenitally negative. It\u2019s corrosively negative, and I think that\u2019s too bad. I\u2019m just one small person in this political universe, but I do know that I infused some level of positivity and respectfulness to the process. And I\u2019m very grateful to have had that opportunity. You pointed out early on last year that Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t doing well with women and that women were not going to vote for her simply because she was a woman. Would Hillary Clinton have won if you had been her campaign manager? [Long pause.] No, Hillary Clinton could not have won this election cycle for a few reasons. One is she could never really escape the fact that, including according to The Washington Post polling, that persistent, nagging majorities of Americans find her to be dishonest and untrustworthy and didn\u2019t particularly like her, either. Two, it\u2019s not clear to me that this woman who has surrounded herself with talented professionals \u2014 I\u2019m very fond of Robby Mook, her campaign manager, for example, and I have a cordial relationship with Huma Abedin \u2014 had ever surrounded herself with people who would actually tell her no. Or that this isn\u2019t a good idea. Or that this isn\u2019t working. Which every leader needs. The other thing is that the question for Americans was not, Would you vote for a woman? But would you vote for this woman? It wasn\u2019t a hypothetical; it was Hillary. I want to go back to October 7th, which is the day the video came out with Trump talking about women and saying he could \u201cgrab them by the p---y.\u201d He didn\u2019t say he did that. Right, he said he could do that. But when I first heard that I thought there was no way someone who said those words could get elected president of the United States. Did you think that? No, never. What was your reaction when you first heard it? I had several reactions. First was to ask him about it, and we discussed it. And I\u2019ll leave it to his public comments about how he felt about it. He recorded the statement right here. It was heartfelt, it was genuine and those were his words. He apologized; he said he doesn\u2019t recognize that, meaning that\u2019s not who he is. And that he\u2019s running for president for a number of reasons, and for the American people, that have nothing to do with that. My reaction, knowing voters as I did, was that we\u2019ll take a hit in the polls \u2014 this will be an obsessive story for God knows how long, and people will draw the wrong conclusions. The pundits will draw the wrong conclusions. They\u2019ll say this will kill him among women. And women will look at that and some will say, \u201cI can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d How many of them already weren\u2019t voting for him is the question nobody asks. Other women will say, \u201cHe\u2019s right, it\u2019s locker-room talk. I don\u2019t like it, but I know men who talk like that.\u201d Or \u201cI listen to rap music artists or comedians who make zillions of dollars talking like that.\u201d They\u2019ll say, \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s not the totality of the man, and it\u2019s not the totality of the candidate who has promised me bigger things, like my job not going to Mexico or China, like a more affordable, accessible health-care act that doesn\u2019t crush small business and make promises it never kept to millions of Americans who never had coverage.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump holds Conway\u2019s hand as she takes a bow during a dinner on the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration in Washington in January. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Was that the lowest part of the campaign for you? It was probably the most difficult part, but really only temporarily. And the temporary part was because I knew he\u2019d stay in the race. I know who he is. I know his steadfastness and his tenacity and his never backing down, never shirking from a fight, never backing down from a commitment that he made. And I also knew he was going to get on that plane and go to that second debate in St. Louis, and indeed he did. You have four kids. Did you have to explain to them why it was okay that someone who said this would be president? It\u2019s a little bit of a cheap shot to raise my kids into a question like that. I just want to say that because people do it all the time. Let me explain why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a cheap shot. A lot of people with kids had to explain that to them. Right, but I already had to explain to my children many times why Hillary Clinton lied so many times and, frankly, why she made a different choice when faced with a cheating husband than my mother did. That was to my older children. I had to explain many times why the media were so unfair to Donald Trump. \u201cWhy would they say this about Donald Trump, Mom, if you\u2019re working for him?\u201d Because kids and others unfortunately think if it\u2019s on TV it\u2019s true. That probably is no longer the case because people realize that no one on TV is under oath and anything can be said in a screaming chyron or, in the case of The Washington Post, unfair and untrue headlines that are just there for clickbait. Have we had unfair and untrue headlines? Oh, yes, yes. It\u2019s been discussed with Marty Baron and Fred Hiatt and Jeff Bezos because I just saw [Bezos] last week. In any event, it\u2019s tougher to explain to my children why people who don\u2019t know me would say I\u2019m stupid or ugly or even worse online. It\u2019s tougher for them to listen to people on TV laugh at me or Donald Trump, ridicule us and never allow us to really get our message across. That\u2019s tougher. On Twitter and Facebook and social media, people really do say nasty things about you. That\u2019s what I hear. But you don\u2019t really respond to any of it. I don\u2019t engage. Why would I? I\u2019m going to let someone redefine and unravel me based on 140 characters or less? And that is a lesson I try to teach my children. Why would I engage strangers? Why would I engage Never Trumpers who are snarkily trying to undercut us. It\u2019s a combination of professional jealousy and a lack of political instincts. They never saw this coming. And I understand why a lot of people feel embarrassed and why they\u2019re looking over their shoulders wondering will they be the first head to roll at this newspaper or this publication or this TV station. Because they were so aggressively bad in their predictions and they didn\u2019t understand America and we did. I\u2019m told I\u2019m attacked on Twitter all the time, but the fact is if you\u2019re so busy that you can\u2019t read most of the criticism, or most of the praise, it really does keep you grounded. Why do you think Mr. Trump can\u2019t do that? Why does he respond to all the \u2014 He doesn\u2019t, honestly. You\u2019re not going to find a more vilified, attacked politician. Do you think the media should change the way it covers Trump? We believe in a free and fair media, but with freedom comes responsibility. It would be great for the media to be less presumptively negative and skeptical and more open and honest about their past unfair and untoward coverage of him and their obligation to deliver news, not opinion masquerading as news or their personal beliefs masquerading as news. I was really astonished to see respected print and electronic journalists outwardly admit during the campaign that Donald Trump forces them to suspend the objective standards of journalism. That is just astonishing because their whole idea was: Stop him, stop him, stop him, which implicitly was: Elect her, elect her. That\u2019s not their job. Many in the media had their thumbs on the electoral scales this year, and that\u2019s totally inappropriate and anti-democratic. That should not be confused with \u201cWe\u2019re going to be tough on him, we\u2019re going to ask the tough questions.\u201d Sure, got it. Check. You\u2019re going to ask tough questions. But that is so fundamentally different from, to coin a phrase, actively trying to interfere in election results and pervert our democracy. Because as with the hacking, the media\u2019s attempt to interfere with democracy and elect Hillary Clinton failed, too. Conway and Steve Bannon after a worship service on Inauguration Day at St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington in January. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The president-elect yesterday called CNN fake news. Is that helpful? Did he do it gratuitously or did he do it in response to the fact that they had published an article online and then talked about it on air that basically gave everybody a GPS and a map and instructions on how to find the BuzzFeed dump of a 35-page document that is not an intelligence report, that was an Internet report assembled by anti-Trump operatives? Presidents and politicians have always criticized news stories, but not \u2014 This is historic and you know it. No one has ever faced the deluge of negativity and criticism that Donald Trump has. It\u2019s just a fact. But by the way, we have to say thank you to many in the mainstream media because it helped us win. It was an elite rejection election in that, fundamentally, it was us versus them, and it turns out there are a heck of a lot more them than us, us being people in politics or media or the donor class. Or in the consulting class, which is nothing short of embarrassing. These noncreative nonthinkers who haven\u2019t come up with a creative or original idea in 30 years are telling us who can win, who can lose three years before an election? That\u2019s over. Donald Trump would say one thing or someone would say one thing about him, and it would literally be breaking news for 10 days. And everybody would dissect it. And I know he\u2019s much better for ratings and clicks, because Hillary Clinton was neither particularly liked nor seen as animated or engaging, but some journalists took leave of their senses and surrendered what they learned in journalism school. If you look at Twitter feeds of some folks, what they write about Donald Trump would never pass editorial muster. And if you\u2019re Joe Blow from The Washington Post and you say tweets are my own and you\u2019re tweeting at 10:15 a.m. as you\u2019re walking in to a presidential press conference or a Trump rally, then your tweets are not your own. You just tweeted in your suit and tie at 10:15 a.m. when you\u2019re clearly in your professional capacity. And it\u2019s zing, zing, zing, zing, zing against Donald Trump. That\u2019s irresponsible, and by the way it\u2019s not journalism. [The Post\u2019s policy is that journalists can use personal social media accounts but they remain, at all times, Washington Post journalists.] You\u2019ve been pro-life for a long time and active on that issue and plan to take part in this year\u2019s March for Life. Why is that so important to you? For several reasons. One is as a culture I fear that we\u2019re becoming too inured and inoculated against how precious life really is. Whether it\u2019s in the womb or at the end of our years. This out-of-sight, out-of-mind mentality has run headstrong now into science and medicine. We see things now that you and I didn\u2019t see when we were kids. You pull up a sonogram, and no one says to you in a patronizing or threatening way, \u201cAdmit it, this is a baby!\u201d Or, \u201cThis is just uterine material.\u201d They basically say, \u201cOh, my God, look at that heart beat at eight weeks.\u201d The New York Times, of all places, had a front-page story above the fold about how with proper medical intervention, babies born at or before 24 weeks can survive outside the womb. Wow, this is amazing. And for us to just look the other way and pretend that abortion is not used by plenty of people as birth control? But I\u2019m also a very nonjudgmental person. I understand why women are pro-choice. I understand why women get abortions. Do you know any women who have had abortions? Many. Do you think they shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to have them? No, I don\u2019t judge them. But that would be the law, that\u2019s what would \u2014 No, here\u2019s why I don\u2019t judge them. And I\u2019ve helped several of them before, during and after. To a person, they all feel some level of regret. And I help them navigate that, too, because they shouldn\u2019t feel that way. (Jesse Dittmar/For The Washington Post) Twenty-five years from now what do you want people to say about you? That I was an excellent mother and a great friend and I brought honor and respect to what I did. I was fair and judicious to people. I had compassion and empathy for those less fortunate than me. I made a difference inside and outside of government and that I was kind and generous and honest. And I want to be famous for my children. I want one of them to cure cancer or win the Nobel Peace Prize or be the first woman president. One of my daughters said, \u201cMom, I don\u2019t want to go to Washington and be known as Kellyanne Conway\u2019s daughter.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, then cure cancer, and I\u2019ll be known as Claudia Conway\u2019s mother.\u201d That\u2019s the way I look at it.

Rain drenched a large part of an area that has been abnormally dry, from northern Louisiana to the Carolinas and Virginia, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor released Thursday. About a half-dozen counties in the northeast Georgia mountains and patches of another half-dozen counties in central Alabama are still dealing with extreme drought, the report shows, as are parts of southeast Oklahoma and western Arkansas. The drought is approaching the one-year mark. Abnormally dry conditions began showing up in March 2016 in parts of the South, and intensified through the spring, summer and fall. Despite the recent heavy rains, drier-than-normal weather is expected to dominate most of the nation through Monday, forecasters project.

Heavy precipitation has eased drought conditions in much of the state. AFP/AFP/Getty Images Heavy precipitation is erasing years of extremely dry conditions in parts of California, with the latest federal report showing that just over 51 percent of the state remains in drought \u2014 and no areas have the worst rating, \"exceptional drought.\" It's the first time since January of 2014 that no part of California was in the exceptional drought category, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor report from weather and agriculture experts. In January of 2016, more than 40 percent of the state had that unwelcome distinction. Before and After: The Rain\u2019s Impact on Three California Reservoirs | Drought Watch | KQED Science https://t.co/HJEIEU58eL \u2014 KQEDscience (@KQEDscience) January 25, 2017 Currently, nearly 39 percent of California is also free of the more benign \"abnormally dry\" status \u2014 which, one year ago, covered the entire state. The change wrought by heavy rains is striking, as seen in a series of side-by-side photos of key reservoirs complied by member station KQED . Drought conditions persist mainly in the south, affecting nearly 25 million people, according to the drought monitor. And Dan Cayan, a climate researcher at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, tells KQED that while some areas have already received a winter's worth of water, the risk of drought shouldn't be discounted. Article continues after sponsorship All of California is now free of \"exceptional drought\" status, but pockets of extreme or severe drought remain in the south, as seen in this image from the U.S. Drought Monitor.

U.S. Drought Monitor \"I'm a little reluctant to say the drought's over, even though conditions have markedly improved,\" says Cayan, citing the need to replenish groundwater aquifers. Relief from the drought has come at a cost, as powerful and drenching storms also brought flooding, mudslides and damage \u2014 including to the iconic \"Pioneer Cabin Tree,\" the sequoia that was carved into a tunnel in Calaveras Big Trees State Park. Since Oct. 1, precipitation is running well above normal levels across the state, according to the National Weather Service .

Cardozo School of Law in New York. \u201cIn fact, the president has very limited power to exercise any kind of significant defunding.\u201d According to a 2012 Supreme Court decision, Mr. Markowitz said, Congress is not permitted to set conditions on spending to coerce states or localities to participate in a federal program against their will. Any conditions, at a minimum, must be directly related to the punitive action. In other words, Mr. Markowitz said: \u201cYou can\u2019t say \u2018if you don\u2019t use your police officers to go after unauthorized immigrants, you don\u2019t get any money for your hospitals.\u2019 They can\u2019t impose conditions that are totally unrelated.\u201d According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center , a national group, at least 39 cities and 364 counties nationwide count themselves as sanctuary jurisdictions , but they vary in how limited they are in restricting cooperation with immigration enforcement. California has been one of the leaders in offering sanctuary, and reaction there was strong. An hour after the president signed the order, a group of California state senators said they planned to fight it in court, with help from Eric H. Holder Jr., former attorney general, whom the Legislature has retained to take on what the senators said they expected would be continued fights with the Trump administration. They said Mr. Trump\u2019s order violated the 10th Amendment by forcing local governments to enforce federal statutes. Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose, who counts his city among the ranks of sanctuaries without using the term, said that, on matters of public safety, \u201dour police chief is the best person to decide how to use the scarce resources we have.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt\u2019s not simply an ideological decision,\u201d he said. \u201cOur Police Department, like most, doesn\u2019t engage in federal tax laws, federal environmental laws or federal immigration laws.\u201d San Francisco featured prominently in the debate over sanctuary city policies after the killing of Kathryn Steinle, a resident of the city, in July 2015. Photo Protesters on Wednesday in Washington Square Park in Manhattan. Credit Christopher Lee for The New York Times Ms. Steinle was 32 when she was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an immigrant from Mexico who was in the United States illegally. He had a long criminal record, a history of heroin abuse and had been deported to Mexico at least five times. During the campaign, Mr. Trump seized on Ms. Steinle\u2019s death as \u201cyet another example of why we must secure our border immediately.\u201d A case brought by the Steinle family in federal court in May blames the San Francisco county sheriff at the time, Ross Mirkarimi, for issuing a memo that ordered his staff to cut off all communication with federal immigration authorities, according to court documents.

(Photo: Melina Vastola, USA TODAY Sports) 4763 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski is still making his presence felt while being away from the team during his recovery from back surgery. According to\u00a0 an ESPN report, \u00a0Blue Devils players have been banned from the team's locker room and are not allowed to wear school apparel. The decision handed down by\u00a0Krzyzewski came during a team meeting at his home this week. Duke is just 2-3 with Jeff Capel serving as interim coach since\u00a0Krzyzewski coached the team on Jan. 4. The latest defeat came at home Monday against North Carolina State after Duke had led by seven points with less than five minutes left. It was the first victory by the Wolfpack in Durham since 1995. Capel did not confirm the bans, but alluded to it during a radio interview. Jeff Capel on WRAL on ESPN report: \"It's pretty disappointing when stuff that happens in a locker room gets out like that.\" \u2014 Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) January 26, 2017 According to the ESPN article, the player punishment would stay in place \"until\u00a0they start living up to the standards of the Duke program.\" The apparel sanction is something that has happened numerous times in Krzyzewski's career when he has been unhappy with the team, former player Mike Gminski said. Gminski says Duke taking away the gear has probably happened 50 times. \u2014 Bobby Rosinski (@BobbyRosinski) January 26, 2017 The prohibitive No. 1 team in the preseason, Duke is just\u00a015-5 overall and 3-4 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The team has dealt with multiple injures to key players, the suspension of Grayson Allen and now the loss of its Hall of Fame coach.

(Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA) American scientists worried about climate change and skeptical of President Donald Trump are planning a protest march in Washington, D.C. March organizers, on the event's website, said it serves as \"a starting point to take a stand for science in politics.\" Organizers launched a Facebook page on Tuesday that's already compiled 123,000 likes while its Twitter account amassed more than 150,000 followers. The event's date, organizers said,\u00a0will be announced in the coming\u00a0days. Marches in other parts of the country and Europe also are being planned. The group's mission statement is set to come out on Monday.

Women's March could lead to bigger movement than Tea Party An effort\u00a0to\u00a0reach march organizers was not immediately returned, but a\u00a0statement on the march's website says supporting science is a non-partisan issue. \"There are certain things that we accept as facts with no alternatives,\" the statement said. \"The Earth is becoming warmer due to human action. The diversity of life arose by evolution. Politicians who devalue expertise risk making decisions that do not reflect reality and must be held accountable. An American government that ignores science to pursue ideological agendas endangers the world.\" Badlands NPS goes on a climate change tweetstorm Trump's stance on climate change, which he has called a hoax, has sparked various resistance efforts since he took office. The Badlands National Park Twitter account went on a mini climate-change tirade on Tuesday. On Wednesday, protestors with the environmental group Greenpeace hung a banner with the word \"resist\" near the White House. Meanwhile, parody accounts for NASA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0have been promoting climate change facts in protest of Trump. On Friday, anti-abortion advocates will meet on the National\u00a0Mall then march to the U.S. Supreme Court as part of the March for Life. The event, which organizers say is the largest pro-life event in the world, happens each year on the anniversary of Roe vs. Wade.

Got it A view of the crowd at the U.S. Capitol ahead of the inauguration of President Trump on Jan. 20. (Bill O\u00d5Leary /The Washington Post) By Karen Tumulty and Juliet Eilperin By Karen Tumulty and Juliet Eilperin January 26 at 7:02 PM Follow @ktumulty Follow @eilperin On the morning after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, acting National Park Service director Michael T. Reynolds received an extraordinary summons: The new president wanted to talk to him. In a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day\u2019s crowds on the National Mall, according to three individuals who have knowledge of the conversation. The president believed that they might prove that the media had lied in reporting that attendance had been no better than average. Trump also expressed anger over a retweet sent from the agency\u2019s account, in which side-by-side photographs showed far fewer people at his swearing-in than had shown up to see Barack Obama\u2019s inaugural in 2009. According to one account, Reynolds had been contacted by the White House and given a phone number to call. When he dialed it, he was told to hold for the president. For Trump, who sees himself and his achievements in superlative terms, the inauguration\u2019s crowd size has been a source of grievance that he appears unable to put behind him. It is a measure of his fixation on the issue that he would devote part of his first morning in office to it \u2014 and that he would take out his frustrations on an acting Park Service director. The inauguration of President Trump on Jan. 20. (Jonathan Newton /The Washington Post) Word rapidly spread through the agency and Washington. The individuals who informed The Washington Post about the call declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the conversation. Neither Reynolds nor the Park Service would talk about it. \u201cThe National Park Service does not comment on internal conversations among administration officials,\u201d agency spokesman Thomas Crosson said. White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the call simply demonstrated that Trump\u2019s management style is to be \u201cso accessible, and constantly in touch.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not somebody who sits around and waits. He takes action and gets things done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons that he is president today, and Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t.\u201d On Saturday, the same day Trump spoke with Reynolds, the new president used an appearance at CIA headquarters to deliver a blistering attack on the media for reporting that large swaths of the Mall were nearly empty during the event. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe caught [the media]. We caught them in a beauty.\u201d \u201cIt looked like a million, a million and a half people,\u201d Trump said, vastly inflating what the available evidence suggested. Later that day, White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated Trump\u2019s complaints about media coverage of the crowd in a tongue-lashing from the lectern of the briefing room. \u201cThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\u201d Spicer said. The Park Service does not release crowd estimates. Experts, however, have estimated that the 2017 turnout was no more than a third the size of Obama\u2019s eight years earlier. Reynolds was taken aback by Trump\u2019s request, but did secure some additional aerial photographs and forwarded them to the White House through normal channels in the Interior Department, the sources said. The photos, however, did not prove Trump\u2019s contention that the crowd size was upwards of 1 million. Reynolds, who had served as the Park Service\u2019s deputy director of operations for six months before assuming the post of acting director, is a third-generation employee who has worked there for more than 30 years. As deputy director, he oversaw the Service\u2019s $2.8 billion budget and more than 22,000 employees. In the days since Trump\u2019s election, the Park Service has become an unlikely protagonist in a battle between the new president and some career government employees. The trouble began late Friday, when the agency\u2019s official Twitter account retweeted two tweets that could be perceived as critical of the new administration: the one comparing the relative crowd size for Trump\u2019s inaugural to that of Obama\u2019s 2009 swearing-in, and another that noted policy pages that had been removed from the White House\u2019s website. That prompted an \u201curgent directive\u201d to Interior employees that they \u201cshut down Twitter platforms immediately until further notice,\u201d which was lifted early Saturday morning. Crosson then apologized on Twitter for \u201cmistaken RTs from our account.\u201d On Tuesday, the Badlands National Park\u2019s Twitter account became a social media sensation when it posted four tweets in a row about rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and the threats posed by climate change. Those tweets were then deleted. An NPS official later explained that Badlands NPS officials learned they were posted by a former employee who still had access to the account, and decided to remove them. [ Interior Department reactivates Twitter accounts after shutdown following inauguration ] Spicer told reporters this week that White House officials had not dictated any agency to impose new restrictions on public communications and that some federal officials, such as those at the Park Service, were not in compliance with their own department\u2019s policies. Trump, meanwhile, has continued to press the argument that the media has given a misleading account of the crowds that attended his inauguration. \u201cI had a massive amount of people here,\u201d the president told ABC News anchor David Muir in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThey were showing pictures that were very unflattering, as unflattering \u2014 from certain angles \u2014 that were taken early and lots of other things.\u201d As he guided Muir through the West Wing, Trump paused at a photo on the wall, taken from behind him as he delivered his inaugural address: \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of the event. Here\u2019s a picture of the crowd. Now, the audience was the biggest ever, but this crowd was massive. Look how far back it goes. This crowd was massive.\u201d Brady Dennis and Lisa Rein contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

May\u2019s status as the first leader to meet the new president is testament to the enduring \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and the U.K. But despite historically good relations between presidents and prime ministers, there are some potentially significant differences that could arise during their meeting. President Trump\u2019s comments about women, Mexicans, Muslims, NATO and his protectionist \"America First\" rhetoric have made the optics of this meeting tricky for May back home. The meeting is coming just days after Trump controversially advocated the resurrection of enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding. May has had to make explicit the U.K.\u2019s position in response, saying her government did not \"sanction\" torture and would maintain that position. May is not without her own baggage -- the U.K. is badly split by the Brexit result and is now preparing for a messy divorce from the European Union. This comes at the same time as it begins looking outward for new trading relationships. May is hopeful that this meeting will kick-start that process. So, this is not just a normal meeting of new leaders from an old alliance but a significant moment for both of them and their countries. As Leslie Vinjamuri, an associate fellow of the U.S. and the Americas program at Chatham House, pointed out, \"We can't actually underestimate the symbolic significance of this visit and what it will signal to many different communities of people across the West and beyond and to states in Europe.\" It is unlikely that at this first meeting anything substantive will emerge but there are nonetheless key issues -- the future of the \"special relationship,\" NATO, global free trade, Vladimir Putin , the Middle East and women\u2019s rights -- that are all worth watching. We break down what to look for below: The 'Special Relationship' The \"special relationship\" has been at the heart of the diplomatic engagement between U.S. and the U.K. since World War II. Churchill and Roosevelt, Maggie and Ronnie, Tony and George have together been incredibly influential. The presidents and prime ministers\u2019 personal chemistry (and political sympathies) has had global significance at key moments in modern history -- World War II, the end of the Cold War and the invasion of Iraq, were all formed in the crucible of the \"special relationship.\" So, a lot is at stake when a new U.S. president and U.K. prime minister meet for the first time. In the case of Trump and May, two very different personalities are about to come face-to-face. \"You couldn't think of two people more diametrically different in their personalities and styles,\" said Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former British foreign secretary during the 1990\u2019s and a cabinet minister under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . However, both have a vested interest in making their relationship work. According to Karin von Hippel, director general of the London-based Royal United Service Institute, \"They won\u2019t ever achieve the relationship that Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had but it\u2019s important that they get along and that they remain as close allies as they can, given the challenges on both sides.\" NATO For many, NATO is the single biggest strategic issue at stake. Trump has declared NATO obsolete and accused some of its European members of not contributing enough resources to the organization. His comments have been perceived as a threat to the viability of an organization that has served as a bulwark against Russia during the Cold War and what many argue has kept global peace for 70 years. May will need to clarify what precisely Trump meant by his comments, according to Rifkind. Undermining NATO is a red line for May. But, as Vinjamuri pointed out, also an opportunity. \"Making sure that NATO remains essential and affirming Britain's role in securing America's commitment to NATO is crucial,\" she said. \"It puts Britain at the center of that trans-Atlantic alliance. If Theresa May can demonstrate that she's the critical partner in affirming America's commitment to European security, that's a real bonus for her.\" Trade Global free trade is perhaps an area where there is the most common ground and interest. May is very keen to show that there is life for the U.K. after Brexit, and a nod to a free trade deal with the U.S. would mean a great deal domestically. Trump has made lots of protectionist noises over \"unfair\" trade agreements and took the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership at the stroke of a pen this week. But he could nonetheless go a long way toward redressing the balance by indicating he\u2019s open to new free trade agreements by setting in motion an agreement with the U.K. Women's Issues In some ways, this is the most controversial issue for May. Ahead of her meeting with Trump, May was already facing questions about how she would respond to the U.S. leader\u2019s previous controversial statements about women. In an interview with the BBC, May said that she would be making \"a big statement about the role of women\" by meeting with Trump and negotiating with him on equal footing. However, the optics of the visit could still be problematic for May, according to Vinjamuri. \"The prime minister needs to find a way to make it clear that partnering with the Americans doesn't mean condoning the racist or sexist or xenophobic rhetoric that comes from the administration because it doesn't reflect Britain's values,\" she said. \"People will certainly be watching to see to what extent the president is challenged and the extent to which he tones that rhetoric down.\" Middle East Trump and May\u2019s meeting comes just days after the White House confirmed that they are in the \"beginning stages\" of moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The move would be a major departure from decades of U.S. policy on the status of Jerusalem and could be one of a few looming rifts on Middle East policy between the U.S. and the U.K. Among the most significant of these is the status of the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has been critical of, and U.S. involvement in the war in Syria. On Syria, there is real concern that Trump\u2019s focus is the war against ISIS and will sit back and, as von Hippel put it, say to Putin, \"'Go ahead and continue what you are doing in Syria.\u2019 Finish off the place basically.\" This is a problem for May, who is very critical of Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria and also needs to address the refugee crisis in Europe, driven in no small part by the war in Syria. However, the biggest area of disagreement is likely to be the Iran nuclear deal, of which the U.K. is a strong supporter and Trump a vocal critic. Ultimately, both Trump and May stand to gain from this visit if no visible fractures emerge. At the very least, according to Rifkind, \"It would certainly make a change if [Trump] was able to say, 'Well, here is a very important international partner with whom I have good relations.'\" 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Rebecca Blackwell, AP) 1023 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 55 COMMENTEMAILMORE American consumers may have to pay more for products ranging from Toyotas to vegetables to beer\u00a0if a proposal floated by President\u00a0Trump to impose a 20% tariff on Mexican imports goes into effect. Trump raised the idea of\u00a0the new tax as a possible way to finance a wall that would straddle the border separating the\u00a0U.S. from Mexico, currently its\u00a0third largest partner in the trade of goods, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center,\u00a0says that while a stronger dollar\u00a0could minimize the pain\u00a0U.S. shoppers feel,\u00a0\u201cthe irony of putting a tariff on Mexican goods is that, to the extent it raises consumer prices in the U.S., consumers will be paying for the wall, not Mexican producers.\u2019\u2019 Mexico sent $295 billion worth of goods across the U.S. border in 2015, the office of the Trade Representative\u00a0says. Overall, U.S. imports from its southern neighbor peaked at $316.4 billion that year. That's in contrast to Mexican-bound exports from the U.S. that amounted to $267.2 billion. The biggest import is cars, with the U.S. spending $74 billion in 2015 for the hundreds of thousands of Chevrolet and Ram trucks, as well as Volkswagens, Fords, Hondas, Nissans and other brands that are assembled in Mexican factories. CLOSE x Share President Trump promised to build a wall that runs along the entire U.S.-Mexico border. Now's he's taking the first steps to make it a reality. USA TODAY NETWORK But cars are far from the only product that U.S. importers bring in from Mexico. Other key categories include machinery, medical instruments, and mineral fuels.The country is also the U.S.\u2019 second-biggest provider of agricultural products, with imports amounting to $21 billion in 2015. \u201cIt is very troubling for world food and agricultural markets for Administration spokespersons to bandy about terms like a 20% tax on all imports from Mexico or other countries,\u2019\u2019\u00a0 Tom Stenzel, President\u00a0and CEO of the United Fresh Produce Association said in a statement. \u201cConsider the impact on American consumers of a 20% hike in the cost of foods such as bananas, mangoes and other products that we simply cannot grow in the United States.\u00a0Consider also what other countries would do to block U.S. exports in retaliation.\u00a0As the Administration looks to incentivize manufacturing jobs in the U.S., we urge President Trump to consider the unique nature of food and not place a new food tax\u00a0on American consumers.\u201d Fresh vegetables purchased from Mexico totaled $4.8 billion in\u00a02015, according to the office of the Trade Representative. Snack food imports totaled $1.7 billion, while wine and beer\u00a0$2.7\u00a0 billion and processed fruit and vegetables peaked at $1.4 billion two years ago Trump mulls 20% border tax on Mexico; aides later call it just an option Representative Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, said in a statement that a\u00a0tariff \u00a0would not only \"disrupt Texas commerce with our most important trading partner, but it would raise consumer prices by 20% on many goods, like so much of the fresh produce upon which we rely at this time of year.'' Automakers have flocked across the border, not only lured by low wages, but to tap into a skilled labor force and Mexico\u2019s multitude of trade deals with countries across the globe. The U.S. has made use of services from Mexico in\u00a0transportation, travel, technology and other industries. Such imports amounted to roughly $21.6 billion in 2015, 11% more than the year before, and roughly 191% more than what was spent on imported services in 1993, before \u00a0NAFTA.

President Trump speaks in Philadelphia on Thursday. (Matt Rourke / Associated Press) Michael A. Memoli and David Lauter Contact Reporters The White House offered a possible answer Thursday for how President Trump\u00a0could pay for the U.S.-Mexico border wall that was his chief campaign promise \u2014 a tax on imports that\u00a0opponents say would raise prices for Americans\u00a0buying groceries, automobiles and gasoline. In a speech to Republican lawmakers\u00a0in Philadelphia, Trump said the new tax plan could \u201cgenerate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall, if we decide to go that route.\u201d Trump promised throughout his campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, and he reiterated that pledge Thursday. \u201cI've said many times that the American people will not pay for the wall,\u201d he said. In fact, however, the plan, which House Republicans have pushed for months, would be a tax paid by American companies, not Mexicans. It would apply equally to all imports from all\u00a0countries and would have no special tie to the wall, except, perhaps, in the president\u2019s personal view of it. But the idea appeared to gain favor with Trump on a day in which he clashed publicly with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a\u00a0Nieto, who said he was canceling a planned visit to the White House next week because of Trump\u2019s insistence that Mexico would pay construction costs. Trump said that the cancellation was by mutual agreement and that the meeting would have been \u201cfruitless\u201d unless Mexico were to \u201ctreat the United States fairly, with respect.\u201d White House officials emphasized that discussions about the tax plan were still in early stages. That\u2019s not entirely true. House Republicans released a detailed version of the plan in June. It\u2019s central to what they envision as the biggest reworking of the corporate income tax in decades. an interview with ABC News this week, a pledge GOP lawmakers and Trump\u2019s... Quizzed about the fate of millions of Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act and its insurance protections, President Trump invariably offers bold but vague\u00a0assurances. \u201cI want to take care of everybody,\u201d he said in an interview with ABC News this week, a pledge GOP lawmakers and Trump\u2019s... (Noam N. Levey) The basic idea would be to lower corporate tax rates, but also to reshape the tax code so that it provides incentives for companies to remain based in the U.S., do more manufacturing here and import less. That would significantly change the playing field for American companies, improving the profits of some but\u00a0hurting others. The proposal has generated intense behind-the-scenes lobbying. Trump had criticized the plan earlier this month as too complex, but the ability to say it would pay for a border wall has apparently made it more attractive to him. \u201cIt clearly provides the funding and does so in a way that ensures that the American taxpayer is wholly respected,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters.\u00a0 Currently, Spicer said, the U.S. taxes companies on their exports\u00a0but not their imports. By taxing imports, \"we can do $10 billion a year\u201d in revenue on goods and services\u00a0brought in from Mexico, he said, \u201cand easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone.\" Mexico is the United States' third-largest supplier of imports \u2014\u00a0chiefly vehicles, electrical machinery, mineral fuels and agricultural products.\u00a0The U.S. imported $316.4 billion in goods and services from Mexico in 2015, while exporting $267.2 billion, according to the office of the U.S. trade representative. If Trump does decide to back the plan, he would be diving into a battle that has bitterly divided Republicans. (Del Quentin Wilber and Brian Bennett) The import tax is key to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s proposal to lower the corporate income tax rate to 20% from its current maximum level of 35%. Some Republican groups, especially big importers such as oil refiners and major retailers, oppose Ryan\u2019s plan.\u00a0 The tax plan, known as border adjustment, acts somewhat like a sales tax on imports. It would affect any country with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit, meaning most of the world, and would\u00a0generate about $1 trillion over a 10-year period, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank. By comparison, the cost of the border wall has been estimated at $12 billion to $38 billion if the administration were to build along the entire 2,000-mile border, which is unlikely. Under the plan, U.S.\u00a0companies would not be taxed on the revenue they make from goods sold for export. By contrast, when they calculate the income tax they owe, they would not be allowed to deduct the cost of goods that they bring into the country. As a result, supporters say, manufacturers would be better off building products in the U.S. and exporting them, rather than importing goods for sale. Oil refineries, retailers and other large importers have lined up against the plan, fearing that the inability to deduct the cost of imports from their tax bill\u00a0could eat heavily into their profits. The influential Koch brothers, whose fortune derives from oil refining, have helped lead the charge against the GOP plan. By contrast, big exporters such as domestic crude oil producers and makers of machinery would see their tax bills fall. \"If you're a Boeing, you'll probably be pretty happy about it,\" said Kyle Pomerleau, director of Federal Projects at the Tax Foundation. Most major economies have value-added taxes with border adjustments that work in a somewhat similar way to the GOP proposal. The U.S. is one of the few countries that taxes export income, but not imports. Opponents of the plan say that companies would pass along the cost of the tax, charging\u00a0consumers more for a wide range of imported products, including Mexican goods such as avocados, tomatoes and beer. \u201cAny policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted , warning that the proposal could be a drag on economic growth.\u00a0 Supporters of the tax plan disagree. One effect of Ryan\u2019s plan would be to raise the value of the dollar, most economists say. A stronger dollar would make imported goods cheaper because the dollar would be worth more pesos, yen or euros. That would offset the effects of the tax, economists say. Spicer said that revenue\u00a0generated by the plan could also be put into other border-security measures, which would stem the flow of cheap labor across the border. He later told reporters that details could change as Trump and Republican congressional leaders debate tax reform, and that Trump\u2019s apparent endorsement of the plan was meant more as a response to critics who doubted the administration had credible options to ensure the cost\u00a0of the border wall would be paid in some form by Mexico, as promised. \u201cInstead of 20% it could be 18;\u00a0it could be 5,\u201d Spicer said of the import tax threshold. \u201cBut the idea is to say ... \u2018OK, here\u2019s one idea that gets it done.\u2019\u201d The GOP-led Congress plans to tackle tax reform in the spring and summer. They intend to use special budget rules to avoid a filibuster in the Senate, and\u00a0aim to finish by August. Ryan did not mention\u00a0financing the border wall with a tax on Mexican imports when asked about the financing plan earlier Thursday, and rank-and-file lawmakers have been squeamish about piling onto the deficit to pay for it while Trump negotiates with the Mexican government for a reimbursement. The speaker said he expected the White House to submit a proposal for funding \u201cvery soon,\u201d\u00a0estimating it would be $12 billion to $15 billion, and that Congress would act by the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30.

Organizers say they will be the highest-ranking White House officials to ever attend the event in person. The March for Life draws supporters from around the country to Washington, D.C., to oppose abortion services. It is held each year around the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade. Many in the pro-life movement have spoken highly of the Trump administration. Tom McCluksy, the vice president of government affairs at the March for Life, expressed optimism for the advancement of a pro-life agenda in the first 100 days. \u201c[President] Trump has made pro-life promises and has assembled a team of personnel with incredible pro-life convictions, and qualifications, starting with ... Pence,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. This year\u2019s march is centered on the theme \u201cThe Power of One.\u201d Beyond Pence and Conway, the lineup of speakers includes Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, and Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey. \u201cIt is our hope that this year\u2019s March for Life will encourage each of us to seek and fulfill our unique mission to the best of our ability because only in doing so we will collectively build a culture of life in the U.S. -- a culture where abortion is unthinkable,\u201d March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said in a statement. The March for Life kicks off at 11:45 a.m. with a rally near the Washington Monument. Demonstrators will then make their way to the Supreme Court. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Mexican President Cancels Meeting With Trump After Border Wall Order By Meghan Keneally Jan 26, 2017, 7:01 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump: Mexico Will 'Absolutely' Reimburse US for Border Wall 0 Shares Email Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto announced on Twitter today that he canceled a scheduled meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump , just one day after Trump signed an executive order calling for the launch of plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \"This morning we informed the White House I will not attend the business meeting scheduled for next Tuesday with @POTUS,\" he tweeted in Spanish. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was under intense domestic pressure to cancel after Trump announced the wall policy yesterday while the Mexican foreign minister was in Washington to meet with top Trump advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon and chief of staff Reince Priebus , among others. President Trump shared an alternative version of how events unfolded. During his speech at the GOP retreat in Philadelphia today, Trump said that he and President Pe\u00f1a Nieto \"agreed\" to cancel their planned meeting in the U.S. next week. \"To that end, the president of Mexico and myself have agreed to cancel our planned meeting scheduled for next week. Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly with respect such a meeting will be fruitless ... we\u2019ll have to go a different route,\" Trump said. Pe\u00f1a Nieto is in a tough spot in his own country, as he reportedly has low approval ratings and received blowback when he met with Trump in August ahead of the U.S. election. Donald Trump Promise Tracker: Where His Pledges Stand Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Trump first met during that August visit, when Trump was the Republican nominee and made a trip to Mexico. During a joint press conference immediately afterward, Trump said, \"We didn't discuss who pays for the wall,\" but Pe\u00f1a Nieto later disputed that comment. In two tweets posted more than an hour after that press conference, Pe\u00f1a Nieto wrote in Spanish that \"at the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\" From there, the conversation turned to other topics and continued in a \"respectful manner,\" he wrote. Trump initially introduced the idea that the U.S. may pay for the wall upfront and then be reimbursed by Mexico during a campaign event in October when he said that he's operating \"with the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall.\" On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer floated a possible 20 percent border tax on Mexico as one possible idea for paying for the wall. \"I think when you take a look at the plan that's taking shape now using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico,\" he said. \"We can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone.\" Spicer later clarified that he was just presenting one possible option to pay for the wall and that a broader \"comprehensive tax reform\" plan is \"in the early stages\" of being crafted by the White House, with the close cooperation of congressional leaders. \"Our job right now isn't to roll something out or to be prescriptive, it's to show there are ways the wall can be paid for, full stop,\" Spicer said, qualifying his previous comments. Many in Mexico City feel canceling the trip was the right thing for their president to do. \"I'm not a fan of the Mexican president but I'm happy he canceled the visit. Trump is capable of anything. If the Mexican president had gone there, Trump would have disrespected him and the Mexicans even more,\" said Gina Macassi, the owner of a grocery store in Mexico City. Raul Olivares, a 28-year-old sociology student, told ABC News that it was an \"important and symbolic decision,\" and tea shop owner Javier Vidrio, 43, said \"it was about time.\" \"For the dignity of our country, it was a good idea,\" Alfredo Castillo, a 40-year-old taxi driver, said. \"We won't pay for the wall but we have to keep negotiating with the U.S.\" ABC News' Anne Laurent and Jordyn Phelps contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Christian Torres, AP) 31 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 17 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States directs an average of $320 million worth of aid a year\u00a0to Mexico for various programs, all of which appear to be targets for President Trump as he looks for ways to pay for the proposed border wall with our southern neighbor. But specialists say the aid\u00a0won\u2019t make for much of a bargaining chip as he tries to goad Mexico into footing the bill for the wall, and in fact, yanking the aid\u00a0could backfire entirely. Trump directed the government Wednesday to total the amount of \"direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis\" in an executive order. That preceded a series of back-and-forth moves Thursday in which Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said his country would not pay for the wall and\u00a0canceled a planned meeting with Trump next week. Then\u00a0the Trump administration said it would hit Mexican imports with a 20% border tax, and then reversed field to say the planned tax was just an option. The largest chunk of U.S. aid\u00a0goes toward law enforcement \u2014 including helping Mexican authorities capture drug lords \u2014 supporting improvements to the Mexican judicial system and security, including along Mexico\u2019s southern border, helping stem the flow of immigrants from Central and South America. \u201cIf we cut off aid to Mexico, we strengthen the drug cartels, we make our border region a lot more lawless place, and we make it easier for undocumented immigrants from Central America to reach the U.S.-Mexico border,\u201d said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University who specializes in Latin America. Read more: Congress will consider up to $15 billion for border wall, GOP leaders say Trump's executive order doesn\u2019t specify what the aid information will be used for, but its inclusion in the order suggests Trump could try to use it as leverage in negotiations over paying for the wall. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Thursday there were \"a buffet of options\" to pay for the wall. According to the U. S. Agency for International Development, roughly a dozen agencies directed roughly $1.6 billion overall in aid to Mexico from 2011 to 2015, the most recent year for which complete data is available. The State Department, Defense Department and USAID provided the largest amounts, accounting for 95% of the $338 million in aid in 2015. The remainder included much smaller slivers from the departments of Energy, Labor, Interior, and Health and Human Services, and the Peace Corps, among others. Law enforcement and counter-narcotics initiatives accounted for $260 million, while support for justice and legal reforms added up to roughly $10 million, and military aid accounting for another $10 million. The other aid initiatives in 2015 include: \u2022 $5.7 million for a program to improve the competitiveness of Mexican businesses and to improve \u201cenvironmental policy management to mitigate climate change and preserve Mexican biodiversity.\u201d \u2022 $4.4 million to help with implementation of programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. \u2022 $ 4 million to support Mexican-led efforts to develop and implement a low-emissions development strategy. \u2022 $4 million for crime and violence prevention. The Bernstein Research group estimated the cost for building the southern border wall could range from $15 billion to $25 billion. If the United States redirected all of its foreign aid, at the current annual average, it would take nearly 50 years to reach the low end of that range. President Trump signs an executive order to start the Mexico border wall project at the Department of Homeland Security facility in Washington on Jan. 25, 2017. \u00a0(Photo: Nicholas Kamm, AFP/Getty Images) Emboldened drug cartels Nonpartisan specialists and human rights advocates both say that cutting off aid in the first place will embolden the cartels whose drugs already flow into the United States. \u201cThose cartels are going to operate with a lot more freedom, and the products that they produce \u2014 heroin, meth amphetamine, cocaine \u2014 are small in volume and don\u2019t need to be taken into areas where walls are built, they\u2019ll be taken through ports of entry and flood the US market,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a regional and military security specialist at Washington Office on Latin America, a research and advocacy group. Jones of Rice University said the Mexican government believes the drug problem is one of U.S. consumption rather than the cartels themselves, so if the United States cuts aid and our relations turn more hostile, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be more likely to turn a blind eye to cartel activity as\u00a0long as it focuses on exporting to the United States.\u201d Matthew Taylor, senior fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the wall construction order and the attempted negotiation itself has made for \u201cone of the more disastrous weeks in U.S.-Latin American relations.\u201d \u201cThe more uncertainty we generate though this attempt at negotiation, the more likely the president\u2019s objectives will be, will not be met -- \u00a0his objectives on security, his objectives on migration and ultimately his objectives in terms of economic growth,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very uncertain game, except for the personal electoral objectives of the president. It seems like it\u2019s a very misguided strategic decision.\u201d ",

Abbott threatens to cut funding to county over sanctuary city policies The governor\u2019s comments come amid a dispute between Abbott and Travis County Sherriff Sally Hernandez, who announced last Friday she would reduce her department's cooperation with federal officials when they request an inmate be deported. \u201cThis is completely outrageous,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cShe would give sanctuary to people in the United States illegally who have been convicted of crimes in the past \u2026 and she would not cooperate with ICE whatsoever.\u201d Abbott already threatened to cut off around $2 million in state funding to Hernandez\u2019s office if she doesn\u2019t comply with the federal mandate.\u00a0 President Trump also signed an executive order on Wednesday threatening to cut off federal grant money for sanctuary cities and states.\u00a0 A sanctuary city is a broadly used term to describe any jurisdiction that refuses to enforce federal immigration laws. In a statement \u00a0to Fox News on Thursday, Hernandez said she has done nothing wrong and is following all state and federal laws while upholding constitutional rights to due process for those in the criminal justice system. \u201cI respect the job of our state leaders, but I will not allow fear and misinformation to be my guiding principles as a leader sworn to protect this community,\u201d she said. \u201cOur community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our\u00a0judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated.\u201d\u00a0 How far Abbott and his Austin allies could go in ousting recalcitrant officials is a matter of dispute.\u00a0 \u201cNeither Gov. Abbott nor the Legislature have any authority to remove a duly elected sheriff, whose office is established by the Texas Constitution,\u201d Democratic Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett said in a statement. \u201cThe governor shows contempt for both the Texas Constitution and the Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution.\u201d\u00a0 While Abbott can\u2019t personally remove a local official, the governor hopes to work with lawmakers in Austin who have filed multiple bills that would punish local governments for not arresting or detaining immigrants living in the country illegally. Last November, Texas state Sen. Charles Perry filed SB 4 which would eliminate sanctuary cities in the state and was similar to one he filed during the 2015 session that would have required county jails to cooperate with\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cWhat the governor said yesterday is that he wanted this added to a bill,\u201d a spokesperson for Abbott told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been bouncing around in the office for a while.\u201d Legal experts say that even if Abbott\u2019s proposal is added to a bill and passes, it would still be a tough fight to remove an elected official. \u201cEven if they amend the statutes to add this, the state would have to clarify the general ground for removal and then get a district attorney to press charges and then it would go to a trial by jury,\u201d Angela Morrison, a professor at Texas A&M University\u2019s School of Law, told Fox News. \u201cGetting rid of the trial by jury would be the hardest part because voters in Texas really want to protect that right.\u201d While this is not the first time that Abbott has had to deal with a rogue law enforcement officer in regard to sanctuary cities \u2013 in 2015, the governor warned\u00a0Dallas County Sheriff\u00a0Lupe Valdez to back down from a policy change on federal immigration detention requests or face financial penalties \u2013 his office says Hernandez has gone a step too far. \u201cThe Travis County sheriff has gone much further than the Dallas sheriff,\u201d a spokesperson for Abbott said. \u201cThe governor\u2019s first priority is protecting his constituents and this prevents him from doing that.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "By James Hohmann By James Hohmann January 26 at 10:33 AM Follow @JamesHohmann George W. Bush leaves President Trump's inauguration last week. (Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA:\u00a0Not even a week into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, some liberal internationalists find themselves privately pining for George W. Bush. Despite acts of brutality that were perpetrated on his watch, Bush always insisted publicly that the United States did not torture. He understood that copping to the enhanced interrogation techniques he had secretly approved could undercut our moral standing on the world stage, provide terrorists a potent recruiting tool and give our enemies an excuse to torture Americans. Trump doesn\u2019t think like that. \u201cI have spoken as recently as 24 hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence,\u201d the new president told ABC News in an interview that aired last night, \u201cand I asked them the question, 'Does it work? Does torture work?' and the answer was, 'Yes, absolutely.'\" Explaining why he wants to reconsider the use of waterboarding, Trump added: \u201cWe're not playing on an even field. \u2026 As far as I'm concerned, we have to fight fire with fire.\u201d Mike Pompeo was reportedly \u201c blindsided \u201d yesterday when he found out about the draft order to consider reopening black sites and resuming waterboarding. During his recent confirmation hearing, the new CIA director promised senators that he would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d resume waterboarding. Trump\u2019s statement is also surprising because Jim Mattis, his new defense secretary, is an outspoken critic of the technique\u2019s usefulness. \u201cI\u2019ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers, and I do better with that than I do with torture,\u201d he has said . John McCain, who was tortured by the communists in Vietnam and has as much moral standing on this issue as anyone, promised to hold firm: . @POTUS can sign whatever executive orders he likes, but the law is the law - we're not bringing back torture https://t.co/m9YjDtNYBQ \u2014 John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) January 25, 2017 -- Yes, Bush invaded Iraq without sign-off from the United Nations Security Council. But he tried earnestly to get it. And he made a big deal about building a coalition of the willing. Not only is Trump talking about \u201ctaking the oil\u201d and eschewing multilateralism, but he is poised to propose a 40 percent reduction in voluntary U.S. support for the U.N. and other global bodies, according to a draft of a forthcoming order obtained by The Post. A separate order would limit U.S. participation in some treaties. \u201cTrump\u2019s new U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, has pledged to put U.S. interests first and use the leverage of disproportionate U.S. funding of the body. But the draft order would go much further, and with an apparent goal of slashing U.S. participation across a swath of U.N. agencies and activities to which the Trump administration objects on fiscal or ideological grounds,\u201d Juliet Eilperin and Anne Gearan report . \u201cThe draft order could reverse or roll back funding for \u2026 international peacekeeping missions and U.S. support for development work.\u201d The new team at the State Department is separately conducting a review of all foreign aid doled out during Barack Obama\u2019s final months in office, including a controversial release of $220 million to Palestinians just hours before Trump assumed the presidency. The review involves dozens, if not hundreds, of foreign aid allocations, Carol Morello reports . Kurdish fighters near the front line of the fight against ISIS. Many of our allies are Muslim.\u00a0(Ahmed Jadallah/Reuters) -- After the Sept. 11 attacks, Bush bent over backwards to say that Muslims were not the enemy. U.S. generals relentlessly made the case that we need Muslim allies to battle terrorism. Trump neither thinks nor talks this way. The new White House says it plans to follow through on the president\u2019s promise to begin \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of would-be immigrants. A draft executive order, which Trump could sign today or tomorrow, would block entry to the United States for 30 days for anyone from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. It would also bar entry for all refugees for 120 days and for those from Syria indefinitely. \u201cWhile all are Muslim-majority countries, the list does not include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and numerous other Muslim-majority countries,\u201d Abigail Hauslohner and Karen DeYoung report . Trump\u2019s move, while stopping short of a full Muslim ban (which would not survive a constitutional challenge in court), would nonetheless have been outside of mainstream Republican thought until very recently. As Mike Pence tweeted just 13 months ago: Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional. \u2014 Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015 Many nonpartisan experts say Trump\u2019s approach will weaken U.S. security. ( One example is here. ) Trump scoffs when asked whether his new immigration policies will stoke anger in the Muslim world and motivate Islamic State terrorists. \u201cAnger? There\u2019s plenty of anger right now. How can you have more?\u201d Trump asked interviewer David Muir last night. \u201cThe world is a mess. The world is as angry as it gets. What? You think this is gonna cause a little more anger? The world is an angry place!\u201d \u201cA blanket ban would compromise this nation\u2019s long-standing position as a sanctuary for desperate and innocent people,\u201d the Post\u2019s independent Editorial Board argues this morning. \u201cAs a backdoor way for Mr. Trump to partially make good on his proposed Muslim ban, it also would be an affront to this country\u2019s status as an example of religious tolerance.\u201d President Trump takes the cap off a pen before signing executive order for immigration actions to build the border wall during a visit to the Homeland Security department headquarters. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) -- Bush made the promotion of democracy a central aim of U.S. foreign policy. Trump explicitly rejects this doctrine . \u201cIt is the right of all nations to put their own interests first,\u201d the new president said during his inaugural address last Friday. \u201cWe do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone.\u201d Bush, during his second inaugural, declared: \u201cIt is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\u201d Irony alert: Yesterday was the sixth anniversary of the start of the Tahrir Square protests in Egypt \u2014 \u201ca fleeting moment where it looked as though the Muslim world was tilting toward Western values,\u201d Annie Linskey notes on the front page of the Boston Globe . Mexican President Vicente Fox and President George W. Bush toast during a state dinner in 2001. (File) -- Bush had warm relations with Mexico. His first foreign trip, less than a month after taking office, was to San Cristobal for a bilateral sit-down with Vicente Fox. One of 43\u2019s deepest regrets remains his failure to achieve comprehensive immigration reform. Trump is now publicly feuding with the president of Mexico over who will pay for the border wall.

Jenna Johnson writes up a pretty stunning exchange: \u201cThe way President Trump tells it, the meandering, falsehood-filled, self-involved speech that he gave at the [CIA] headquarters was one of the greatest addresses ever given.\u201d \u201cThat speech was a home run,\u201d Trump told David Muir. \u201cSee what Fox said. They said it was one of the great speeches. They showed the people applauding and screaming. \u2026 I got a standing ovation. In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl, and they said it was equal. It lasted for a long period of time.\u201d Four times, the president referred to himself in the third-person.

The terrain is very rough in some areas. 2. Unlike Arizona, New Mexico and California, most of Texas is privately owned. 3. Most of the border is natural, but a human-made barrier is not. 4.

( New York Times ) TRUMP'S VOTER FRAUD FANTASY: -- Why does the president falsely believe that as many as five million voted illegally? The New York Times\u2019 Glenn Thrush has the stunning answer : When Trump huddled with top House and Senate leaders at the White House on Monday, he backed up his assertions of rampant voter fraud by citing a vague anecdote from a German golfer who is not eligible to vote in the United States.\u00a0The witnesses described the story this way: [Bernhard] Langer, a 59-year-old native of Bavaria, Germany \u2026 was standing in line at a polling place near his home in Florida on Election Day, the president explained, when an official informed Mr. Langer he would not be able to vote. Ahead of and behind Mr. Langer were voters who did not look as if they should be allowed to vote, Mr. Trump said, according to the staff members \u2014 but they were nonetheless permitted to cast provisional ballots. The president threw out the names of Latin American countries that the voters might have come from. \u2026 The anecdote, the aides said, was greeted with silence, and Mr. Trump was prodded to change the subject by [Reince Priebus] and [John Cornyn] \u2026 In the emerging Trump era, the story was a memorable example, for the legislators and the country, of how an off-the-cuff yarn \u2014 unverifiable and of confusing origin \u2014 became a prime policy mover for a president whose fact-gathering owes more to the oral tradition than the written word.\u201d -- If it's possible that millions of illegal votes were cast, isn't it possible that such massive fraud could have\u00a0also helped him? No, says Trump. In fact, zero illegal votes were cast for him, he told ABC last night. \u201cOf those votes cast, none of 'em come to me. None of 'em come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of 'em come to me,\u201d Trump said. He added later: \u201cThose were Hillary votes.\u201d Recall that he won by\u00a0 about 80,00 votes in the three states that mattered . ( Philip Bump ) -- Sean Spicer suggested during his briefing that the investigation will focus on large states where Trump didn\u2019t compete .

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the president\u2019s investigation would examine \u2018the integrity of our voting system\u2019 and not just the 2016 election. The Justice Department, which investigates claims of election crimes, has not historically launched a criminal investigation at the request of a president. An attorney general could order an investigation, but Trump\u2019s nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, has not yet been confirmed, and his spokeswoman declined to comment. Justice officials said they knew nothing about an investigation into voter fraud and referred questions to the White House.\u201d Former assistant attorney general for civil rights Tom Perez called Trump\u2019s planned probe a \u201ctotally stupid and wasteful investigation into nonexistent problems.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more colossal waste of taxpayer dollars than to initiate this investigation,\u201d said Perez, who is now in the running to lead the DNC. \u201cThis is all about ego. The issue of in-person voting fraud is virtually nonexistent.\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said his committee will not join Trump in investigating the so-called fraud: \"If he wants to have an investigation, have at it. I just don't see any evidence of it.\u201d ( CNN ) \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any evidence to that effect,\u201d said Sen.

Drew Harwell reports : \u201cThe increase \u2026 could boost the revenue of the Palm Beach club Trump has called the \u2018Winter White House.\u2019 It could also directly benefit his private fortune because he has refused to divest his business holdings while in the Oval Office. Since his election victory, Mar-a-Lago has assumed a prized role in Trump\u2019s presidency, rivaling Trump Tower as a focal point of his lifestyle and ambitions. [And] the club\u2019s deep-pocketed clientele are offered the opportunity to encounter the president when he is relaxing at his vacation home.

It\u2019s the same one that the Bush administration was accused of using to evade transparency rules after claiming to have \u201clost\u201d 22 million emails. It\u2019s unclear how or if the staffers are using the account, but the move comes after Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton on the campaign trail for her use of a private email server at the State Department. Now, the new staff risks repeating the same mistake. -- \u201c Wilbur Ross and the Era of Billionaire Rule ,\u201d by Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s Max Abelson: \u201cTrump\u2019s proposed cabinet has a net worth of more than $6 billion.

He\u2019s been on both sides of perhaps the most pivotal issue of the 2016 campaign\u2014free trade\u2014depending on how it affected his own wealth. If confirmed as Commerce secretary, as is widely anticipated, Ross would be expected by Trump\u2019s electorate to deliver on promises of working-class jobs and an industrial renaissance. Yet he would have the means to continue rewarding the Establishment.

Now \u2026 Trump is showing that at least some of them were indeed meant literally \u2014 putting him at odds not only with critics but with some members of his own party. \u2026 [But] Trump\u2019s moves have alarmed Democrats, some of whom were cautiously optimistic that they could work with Trump as a self-proclaimed non-ideological dealmaker but who now see him fulfilling their worst fears.\u201d -- Unlike most Republicans, Trump does not believe in federalism. He has signaled sweeping intervention into the way state and local officials carry out policing, treat immigrants, and run elections \u2013 setting off a wave of defiance and apprehensive from some of America\u2019s largest cities. Katie Zezima, Wesley Lowery and Jose A. DelReal report : \u201cIn an executive order signed Wednesday, Trump directed the Department of Homeland Security to find ways to defund cities and jurisdictions out of step with his immigration priorities. That action \u2014 which could cost sanctuary cities \u2026 millions of dollars \u2014 is the latest in a series of moves where Trump has appeared willing to step on state-level or municipal prerogatives. In the scuffle, U.S. mayors have emerged as key players in the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda. At the center of the sanctuary city debate is a disagreement over whether local police officers should be required to help immigration officials enforce federal immigration laws. Many liberal mayors, including Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and New York City\u2019s Bill De Blasio, have argued that requiring local police departments to assist immigration agents with deportations could sow distrust among immigrant populations. It could also discourage undocumented victims or witnesses from coming forward to report crimes.\" -- Trump -- who flew cross-country hundreds of nights during the campaign to sleep in his own bed -- spoke to the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman about how his new home stacks up to the Trump Tower. \u201cHis mornings, he said, are spent as they were in Trump Tower.

There are also potential overhauls of the nation\u2019s air traffic control system, hydroelectric plants and energy grid, as well as ports and waterways.\u201d The list comes after the National Governor\u2019s Association polled each state for help compiling three to five projects apiece to forward to Trump\u2019s team. While there is no dollar figure attached to individual projects on the list, a letter sent by the NGA says the \u201cinitial spend\u201d on projects is expected to be $150 billion during 2017, with the effort continuing over additional years. -- Federal agents are reinvestigating dozens of Syrian refugees already in the U.S. after discovering a vetting lapse that allowed some who had potentially negative background information in their files to enter the country.

Anna Fifield reports from Tokyo : Ivanka Trump is widely revered as the \u201cperfect woman\u201d in the highly patriarchal society, and the popularity of her brands has skyrocketed as women wonder, breathlessly, how the put-together mother and career woman seems to have it all.\u201d \u201cShe is a good example that a woman can do an outstanding job and handle a misogynist father like Trump, without pushing too much of a feminist agenda or confronting men too much,\u201d said one blogger in Japan. \u201cThat is something that Japanese women want but have a hard time doing in a still male-dominated society.\u201d -- Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, the Times of Israel reports . In a statement, Netanyahu\u2019s office said Giuliani delivered a \u201cpersonal message\u201d from Trump to the prime minister, in anticipation of their scheduled meeting in early February. -- The Post\u2019s Ishaan Tharoor calls Trump \u201cthe U.S.\u2019s first Latin American president\u201d: \u201cIf it weren't clear before the inauguration, it certainly is now: Trump's presidency represents a radical departure from the norms of American politics. Yet to observers elsewhere, Trumpism feels deeply familiar. Trump may want to stop the flow of migrants and goods from south of the border, but he has imported a political style ingrained in Latin American politics: that of the nationalist demagogue. A number of Latin American analysts have suggested over the past year that it's useful to view Trump through the lens of the \u2018caudillo,\u2019 or strongman. It's a tradition that extends from the last days of Sim\u00f3n Bolivar, South America's great liberator, to the current bluster of leaders \u2026 Sure, Trump is no military despot like Chile's late Augusto Pinochet \u2026 nor is he a defiant autocrat like the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2026 But to those who have lived under such leaders, it feels like Trump has been taking notes.\u201d Rep.

Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0of Hawaii met with President Bashar al-Assad during her secret trip to Syria last week and, now that she's returned, is downplaying his responsibility\u00a0for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians.\u00a0\"Whatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria,\" she told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper last night. \"In order for any possibility of a viable peace agreement to occur, there has to be a conversation with him.\" She added that the Syrians she met with told her there are \u201cno moderate rebels\u201d in the country. -- Journalists following the Syria story closely are stunned by what they see as her breathtaking naivet\u00e9: . @TulsiGabbard says the Syrians she spoke to all support Assad.

THERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Russia is winning so much that they\u2019re going to get tired of winning. Steven L. Hall retired from the Central Intelligence Agency in 2015 after 30 years. Most of Hall\u2019s career was spent abroad, running covert operations in the countries of the former Soviet Union and the former Warsaw Pact. He writes in a piece for The Cipher Brief : \u201cThe list of wins for the Russians in the wake of the hacks, despite the fact that in the end, they have been found out, is significant. While there may be even more benefits down the road, a brief tally gives a general sense for how well the Russians have done.\u201d Four examples: Disruption of the American political system: \u201cDisrupting the U.S. is usually Putin\u2019s default setting (see also: Syria), because Putin believes that which weakens the U.S., usually strengthens Russia. Remember, Putin views democracy as an existential threat to his regime, and the more distracted the U.S. is with internal political matters, the less it will be fomenting color revolutions and attempting to unseat dictators (e.g. Assad). Cracks in the U.S. political system \u2013 especially in a bedrock piece of it like elections \u2013 also plays to a favorite Kremlin theme, namely that democracy is a fatally flawed, hypocritical system, and that autocracies, such as Russia\u2019s or China\u2019s, are no worse, and in many ways better.\u201d Disrupting and discrediting the U.S. intelligence system: \u201cIt is difficult to imagine Putin himself doing a better job of scripting what Trump has said about the U.S. Intelligence Community in the wake of the hacks. \u2026 This is a win on two levels for Putin. First \u2026 Russians always believe that U.S. intelligence enjoys much more political power than it really does. So Putin probably believes the CIA, NSA, and FBI have been badly hobbled, and their influence with the White House seriously eroded. Second, on an emotional level, it must please the former KGB officer in Putin to see his arch enemies take hits from the incoming president. Morale, the Kremlin probably assumes, must be low inside U.S. intelligence. This can only be good for Russia.\u201d Recognition of Russia as an equal, at least on cyber: \u201cIt is worth recalling that a great deal of what drives Russian foreign policy is Putin, and Russia\u2019s need to feel they are strategic players on the world stage. \u2026 Search on your computer how many times senior Russian officials use terms like \u2018respecting Russia\u2019 and \u2018Russia is a great power.\u2019\u201d Intense American focus on the hack, not the larger influence operation: \u201cThe hacking of the DNC, as well as other targets in the U.S., has caused a great dust storm of media and public attention on all things cyber, which is excellent news for the other, arguably more important parts of the much larger Russian influence operation.\u201d Mike Rounds at work in Sioux Falls. (DIrk Lammers/AP) -- Mike Rounds of South Dakota is going to play an important role in one of the Senate\u2019s two Russia investigations. From Karoun Demirjian : \u201cIn the next week or two, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said, his committee will launch its official investigation into how best to deter and counteract cyber-threats posed by countries such as Russia. He plans to do so with at least one full committee hearing. \u2026 Following that, at an undetermined point in the future, the plan is to hand off the day-to-day of that investigation to the head of a new cyber-security subcommittee.\u201d Backstory: Lindsey Graham was supposed to chair this new subcommittee. BUT it would have been his third gavel, so under the conference rules he\u2019d need to get a waiver from GOP leadership. They might not have wanted to give someone willing to criticize the president a bigger platform to highlight Trump\u2019s links to Russia. So McCain is giving the spot to Rounds, but he\u2019s also giving himself a spot on the subcommittee. Rounds will not have a free hand: In an interview with Karoun, Rounds said he has confidence in the new administration because of James Mattis as Pentagon chief. Rounds also said that he is \u201cnot looking for a fight\u201d with the Trump administration, but added that he is prepared \u201cto go wherever the information takes us,\u201d promising \u201cwe\u2019re going to get results.\u201d The obscure South Dakotan has lobbied for cyber security responses in relatively quiet anonymity, but his signature mark in the arena is the current law, passed as part of a massive defense bill last year, insisting the Pentagon define when a cyber breach or attack constitutes an act of war. \u201cHis goal now is to craft policy describing what to do in the event of a cyber attack,\u201d Karoun reports. \u201cHe would not outline his ideal terms, pledge to fully publicize the results or endorse new sanctions on Russia. \u2026 But Rounds said that would-be hackers and adversaries should understand there will be \u2018serious repercussions\u2019 for anyone trying in the future to interfere with an election through cyberspace.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: First, Lindsey Graham made an #alternativefacts joke: Mainstream media misses scoop of the year - @TheOnion nails it.

    "text": "Jan 26 2017, 3:03 pm ET Minnesota Transgender Teen Sued By Her Own Mom Speaks Out by Mary Emily O'Hara advertisement On Thursday morning at a U.S. District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota, an improbable case began to unfold. As a courtroom full of about 20 people looked on, Anmarie Calgaro's attorneys explained why the small-town mom from the state's northernmost \"Iron Range\" is suing her own 17-year-old child. U.S. District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota U.S. District Court The teen in question\u2014referred to as \"E.J.K.\" in court memos\u2014says she's been living on her own for two years. After the minor worked with a legal aid group on an emancipation statement, she began to seek transgender-specific medical care at a local clinic. When the teen's estranged mom discovered E.J.K. had begun to receive gender transition-related care, she tried to intervene\u2014but said she was surprised to discover her parental rights had been effectively terminated. In November, Calgaro filed a lawsuit against her daughter, health clinics and county agencies. Alternative Facts While Calgaro, speaking at a November press conference, portrayed herself as a loving and concerned mom, her transgender teen daughter's court declaration tells a different story. According to an extensive brief filed by E.J.K.'s attorneys and shared with NBC News, the teen grew up in Hibbing, Minnesota, in a house where unstable parents struggled with substance abuse. In court documents, she describes making her own meals and getting herself dressed for school at a young age, often relying on a \"network of other adults who supplied some of the care and nurturing that her biological parents were unable to offer.\" Anmarie Calgaro wipes tears from her eye on Nov. 16, 2016, during an announcement that she is filing a federal lawsuit because several organizatations are supporting her child's sex-change procedure without her permission. Don Davis / Forum News Service The teen also said when she first came out as gay around age 13, her mother and stepfather became verbally and physically abusive. At age 15, she said, her mom gave her permission to move in with her biological father\u2014who became incarcerated shortly afterward. E.J.K. then stayed with her grandmother and a series of friends before finally getting her own apartment, where she currently lives. The teen is remarkably self-sufficient: She has her own apartment, a full-time job and will graduate high school in the spring. She has already received two acceptance letters, say court documents, from college nursing programs. She turns 18 in July. E.J.K. said she has identified as a girl since she was a young child and began to seek treatment in the summer of 2015, once she was living on her own. \"I was not pressured in any way by my providers to consent to this treatment,\" she said in court papers. \"My providers had no involvement in my decision not to involve my mother in my health care decisions.\" But at a November press conference, Calgaro grew visibly upset as she recalled discovering that her daughter was receiving medical care without anyone notifying her directly. \"The news that county agencies and health service providers, the school and other county and state offices were completely bypassing me came as a total shock,\" Calgaro said at the press conference. \"Why wasn't I even notified?\" The Lawsuit Calgaro's lawsuit seeks damages from St. Louis County, where her hometown is located. She's also suing the St. Louis School Board and the principle of her daughter's high school, the director of the county's Health and Human Services agency, and two nonprofit health clinics. Calgaro also wants to regain parental control of E.J.K. and prevent healthcare providers from offering any further treatment. While the original complaint asked for a jury trial, Calgaro's attorneys later filed a motion for summary judgement\u2014hoping to speed up the case. E.J.K. turns 18 this summer, at which point regaining parental control won't be an option. But if Calgaro wins the case\u2014which attorneys for the teen say is a long shot\u2014she could see a settlement payout either way. Numerous court briefs were filed in the case, including a brief that states E.J.K. should be dropped from the lawsuit because she's \"not a proper defendant.\" Other briefs filed by the school board, clinics, and health agency named in the suit all basically argue the same thing: Calgaro doesn't have a case because her daughter perfectly fits the definition of an emancipated minor. Thursday's oral arguments lasted about an hour, with lawyers mostly arguing about whether Calgaro has a constitutional ground for suing anyone. In the end, the judge told the courtroom that he plans to take the case under advisement, apologizing for a backlog that could delay the process. Health Care Challenges for Trans Youth According to Minnesota transgender advocates, Calgaro's case could make a bad situation even worse in terms of access to transgender health care services. David Edwards of the Minnesota group Transforming Families told NBC News that even though he's an employee at the University of Minnesota\u2014where there is a progressive Transgender Health Services clinic\u2014his health insurance would still exclude his own trans daughter from coverage of most gender-affirming care. \"If she were to need any medical care for gender dysphoria\u2014such as hormone blockers or hormone replacement therapy, surgeries\u2014it's categorically excluded,\" said Edwards, who noted that his daughter is still too young to need such services but could in the near future. \"Parents are the gatekeepers for all health care decisions, because they usually provide the coverage,\" Edwards said. \"Ordinarily, that facilitates access to care. Most of our families have the opposite problem, where they're trying to access care that they have a hard time getting approved because it's being denied in the first place.\" Even if Calgaro could block her daughter's medical care, transgender advocates said, it would only delay the inevitable. \"Some parents think that trans health care providers encourage people to transition. But they don't, and we don't need encouragement,\" said Liz Lilly of the Minnesota Transgender Alliance, who attended Thursday's hearing. \"We only put ourselves through this, because we need to.\" But Lilly worries about the possible \"chilling effect\" that a win could produce among health care providers. \"Trans medical resources, especially for minors, are in short supply,\" Lilly said. \"At my clinic, there is a year-long waitlist for trans teens to be seen by a therapist. This lawsuit could create a chilling effect on providers or clinics who would want to avoid lawsuits, even ones without merit. This could make all health care, including trans health care, more difficult to get for emancipated teens.\" Attorneys representing E.J.K. told NBC News that Calgaro is unlikely to win the case based on the emancipation issue, which is already a firm statute. No matter what happens in the case, E.J.K. will soon be an adult. \"[E.J.K.] has persevered through so much and shown so much initiative,\" Lilly said. \"Though this case may make trans youth feel even more helpless, I hope they also hear the message from the community that they are supported and loved by us.\" Follow NBC Out on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .

The regents approved a 2.5% tuition increase, the first since 2010-11. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) Teresa Watanabe Contact Reporter University of California regents on Thursday\u00a0lifted a six-year freeze on tuition, approving a 2.5% increase beginning this fall in order to pay for more faculty, classes and student services. The vote was 16-4, and many of the regents\u00a0expressed regret about having to raise costs for students. But UC President Janet Napolitano told regents an increase was needed to ensure that\u00a0the renowned public research university system delivers the same top-notch education today as in the past even as it grapples with escalating enrollment demands and reduced state support. The regents voted to raise tuition to $11,502 for the 2017-18 school year \u2014 a 2.5%, or $282,\u00a0increase. The student services\u00a0fee would increase by $54\u00a0to $1,128. The action marked UC\u2019s first tuition increase since the 2010-2011 school year.\u00a0 Nonresident undergraduates would\u00a0face a total increase of $1,668. They would pay\u00a0the same higher\u00a0base tuition and student fees as well as\u00a05%\u00a0more\u00a0in\u00a0supplemental tuition,\u00a0which would rise\u00a0$1,332,\u00a0from $26,682 to $28,014 next year. Financial aid would cover the increases for two-thirds of the university\u2019s roughly\u00a0175,500\u00a0California resident undergraduates.\u00a0 The increases in tuition and fees were part of a $7.8-billion operating budget plan for 2017-18 approved by regents.\u00a0 University of California President Janet Napolitano assured vulnerable immigrant students Wednesday that, despite fear and uncertainty about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u00a0the university would protect them.\u00a0 \u201cUC chancellors and I have reaffirmed our intentions to ensure that every corner of the... University of California President Janet Napolitano assured vulnerable immigrant students Wednesday that, despite fear and uncertainty about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u00a0the university would protect them.\u00a0 \u201cUC chancellors and I have reaffirmed our intentions to ensure that every corner of the... (Teresa Watanabe) \u201cOur resources are strained to the limits,\u201d UC Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom told regents. Some students protested the hike, arguing\u00a0that tuition has more than doubled since 2006, to the highest level in California history. Even with financial aid, some said they still faced hardships paying for housing and\u00a0food in the high-cost areas where many UC campuses are located, such as Berkeley, Westwood and San Diego. And Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s proposed phaseout of the Middle Class Scholarship program will further hurt students, UC Davis student body president Alex T. Lee told the regents Thursday. \u201cStudents are infuriated by a rise in tuition, even by a single cent. Every single raise in tuition is deepening the dependency on taxing students to support the UC, which should be the last resort of funding,\u201d Lee said.\u00a0\u201cWe are facing a crisis of affordability and raising tuition will exacerbate the existing housing and food insecurity problems you know we are experiencing.\u201d\u00a0 But student opposition was more muted than in November, when protesters briefly shut down the regents\u2019 discussion on the tuition issue\u00a0and were told to leave the meeting or face arrest.\u00a0 UC Berkeley \u2019s student newspaper, the Daily Californian, last week editorialized in favor of an increase, saying it was both reasonable and necessary because the state had failed to provide adequate funding. At the same time, the editorial said, the state has continued to pressure UC to increase its enrollment, leading to \u201covercrowded classrooms, housing insecurity and overstrained campus infrastructure\u201d at UC Berkeley. \u201cThe small tuition hike can alleviate these problems and give the university more money to improve services,\u201d the editorial board wrote. Napolitano\u2019s office, in a\u00a0 memo to regents , presented data showing that state support for instructional costs per student\u00a0dropped by more than half, from $16,980 in 2000-01 to an\u00a0estimated $7,160 this year. Over the same time, the share UC has to cover \u2014\u00a0from tuition and fees and general funds\u00a0\u2014 rose from $5,860 to $9,450. Despite the reduced funding, UC has enrolled about 7,400 more California undergraduates\u00a0since 2015-16 \u2014 the largest increase in 70 years \u2014 amid\u00a0political pressure to counter the rise in out-of-state students. Officials plan\u00a0to add another 2,500 California undergraduates and 900 graduate students this fall.\u00a0 UC officials say the state has not fully funded the costs of the additional\u00a0Californians. One consequence, they said,\u00a0has been a rise in the student-to-faculty ratio\u00a0from the historical level of about 18 to 1 to the current 21 to 1. The hikes would bring in $88\u00a0million, according to UC officials\u00a0\u2014 one-third of which would go directly to financial aid. The rest would be used to support enrollment growth\u00a0as well as address other pressing\u00a0needs, including adding\u00a0faculty, counselors and tutors\u00a0and expanding\u00a0mental health services. Leaders of several campuses have individually said\u00a0they would use additional tuition revenue to hire 25 to 50 faculty members.

President Donald Trump speaks briefly to reporters as he arrives aboard Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, January 26, 2017.\u00a0 REUTERS Email Five days after an Anonymous hacker publicly revealed security flaws in U.S. government Twitter accounts, including President Donald Trump\u2019s official @POTUS account, the White House has taken action. Up until this afternoon, the @POTUS Twitter handle was registered to a personal Gmail address, which at one point appeared to be tied to Mr. Trump\u2019s social media director Dan Scavino.\u00a0 Hacker @WauchulaGhost , who became famous in June for hacking into dozens of pro-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Twitter accounts and populating them with gay pride messages , decided to dig into the president\u2019s social media account after hearing Mr. Trump discuss cybersecurity last week. \u201cOf course I had to look at his Twitter account to see if his partial email was exposed,\u201d the hacker told CBS News via direct message on Twitter. \u201cThe first time I looked most of the presidential accounts were using Gmail and had partial phone numbers exposed.\u201d Hey @POTUS , On a serious note. Lets fix your Security settings. Should I email you? #GhostOfNoNation @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/FRdMJnZaNr It didn\u2019t take long for other Twitter users to run their own tests, attempting to sign into the president\u2019s Twitter account and posting screen shots of their findings. \uf6a8HEADS UP\uf6a8 The password for the @POTUS account is linked to an unsecured gmail address. Day 7 \u2014 Thomas C. Theiner (@noclador) January 26, 2017 Users were shocked to discover the president did not have two-factor verification enabled for greater security, thus allowing them to see a portion of the email address linked to the account. \u201cI asked @Jack [Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey] weeks ago if Trump\u2019s Twitter account had two-factor authentication. Turns out it didn\u2019t,\u201d BBC reporter Dave Lee tweeted on Thursday. Twitter \u00a0explains that login verification adds an extra layer of security, requiring you to enter your password and a subsequent six-digit access code any time you try to log in. \u201cIf they would have two-factor enabled on their Twitter accounts, the partial numbers would have been hidden,\u201d @WauchulaGhost explained. \u201cSo the question is, were their Gmail accounts secure?\u201d When asked whether that means the accounts were easier to hack into, @WauchulaGhost said, \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d By midday Thursday, the email addresses connected to @POTUS\u2019 account were switched to government addresses. However, internet users still criticized officials for not enabling two-factor for the president\u2019s account. It looks like White House officials got the message. By 4:30 p.m. ET, the email addresses were no longer visible, meaning the appropriate security measures were taken.

Mark Morgan became the latest high-profile agency head to leave as the new administration takes over. The circumstances of his departure are unclear. Customs and Border Protection U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan, left, and Deputy Chief Carla Provost, testify during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs concerning border protection, on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016 in Washington. Alex Brandon / AP His exit was announced by Kevin McAleenan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \"On behalf of the men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Border Patrol, I want to thank Mark Morgan for his unwavering dedication to our border security mission, and recognize his life-long career in service to the nation,\" he wrote in a letter to the ranks. Morgan did not release any statement about his departure. A former FBI agent, Morgan had held the top post at the agency for just seven months and was the first outsider to head the agency since it was founded in May 1924. But almost from the start, Morgan found himself at odds with the National Boarder Patrol Council, the union which represents the agents and which endorsed Trump early on in the presidential campaign. It didn't help that Morgan's first job at the agency was investigating allegations of abuse against migrants by Border Patrol agents. Morgan was appointed to that post in 2014 after James Tomscheck was removed by the Obama Administration following the release of a scathing report of the Border Patrol's use of force. When Morgan was appointed chief, the union stepped up their criticism and eagerly aligned itself with Trump, who launched his campaign by vowing to build a wall on the border to keep out Mexican \"rapists\" and \"criminals.\" Corky Siemaszko ",

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The White House on Thursday appeared to endorse a 20 percent tax on all imports to the United States, only to insist a few hours later that it was not endorsing the plan. Congressional Republicans have proposed the import tax as part of a broader overhaul of corporate taxation, and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that revenue from the tax would cover the cost of a wall on the United States-Mexico border. Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who authored the plan, told Fox News Thursday afternoon that President Trump appeared to be on board with it after an appearance by Mr. Trump at a retreat for congressional Republicans in Philadelphia.

Headlining the list of reserves is Russell Westbrook, who was left off the starting roster \u00a0(via a fan-voting tiebreaker) despite the fact that he's\u00a0on pace to become the first player since\u00a0Oscar Robertson\u00a0(1961-62) to average a triple-double throughout an entire season.

He's\u00a0Utah's first All-Star since Deron Williams (2011). DeAndre Jordan, Clippers (first selection)\u00a0- Known for his rebounding prowess and efficiency from the field, Jordan is doing just that in his ninth season,\u00a0leading the NBA in both categories (14 rebounds per game, 69% shooting).

    "text": "info <p>Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., joined by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., meets with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2017, as he announced that he has invited President Donald Trump to address a Joint Session of Congress on Feb. 28.&nbsp;</p> Close J. Scott Applewhite, AP Congressional leaders are considering legislation to fund President Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, using taxpayer dollars despite promises that Mexico would finance the project. In an interview on MSNBC with Greta Van Susteren, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, was asked who is going to pay for the border wall. \u201cFirst off, we\u2019re going to pay for it and front the money up,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut I do think that there are various ways -- as you know, I know your follow-up question is, is Mexico going to pay for the wall? There are a lot of different ways of getting Mexico to contribute to doing this. And there are different ways of defining how, exactly they pay for it.\u201d Ryan added that Republicans support the president\u2019s goal of building the wall and securing the border. \u201cWe agree with that goal and we will be working with him to finance construction of the physical barrier, including the wall, on the southern border,\u201d Ryan said. It\u2019s unclear if the funds would be a supplemental appropriations bill or part of a government funding package that Congress must take up in April. Republicans, however, might not be as united on this issue as Ryan claims. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, for example, criticized the proposal in a statement Wednesday. His district straddles 800 miles of the border with Mexico from San Antonio to El Paso and is a former undercover CIA officer. \u201cThe facts have not changed. Building a wall is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 23rd District of Texas, which I represent has over 800 miles of the border, more than any other Member and it is impossible to build a physical wall in much of its terrain. Big Bend National Park and many areas in my district are perfect examples of where a wall is unnecessary and would negatively impact the environment, private property rights and economy.\u201d Mr. Trump on Wednesday signed two executive orders on immigration and one that calls for the construction of a physical wall along the border. He said in an interview with ABC News that the construction would begin within months . ",
