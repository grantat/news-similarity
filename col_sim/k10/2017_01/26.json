Oprah has called Moore an inspiration and \"one of the greatest ever,\" so she was shocked when Moore phoned into\u00a0The Oprah Winfrey Show\u00a0back in 1993, and completely overwhelmed when\u00a0Moore showed up, in person,\u00a0to a 1997 episode. When Moore appeared, Oprah cried and kept looking at the actress in disbelief. \"Let me just say, you have no idea what you've meant to me,\" she told her idol. \"You were the light. Every Saturday night (I'd watch you) while I was conditioning my hair ... I wanted to work in Minneapolis with you.\" After Moore exited, Oprah told her audience,\u00a0\"I need to calm down. Can I have a Kleenex to get the river that's running under my armpits. Oh, boy!\" The TV clip is making the rounds on Twitter.

Chiu / Associated Press Tesla Motors chief Elon Musk, above in 2015, has been tweeting a lot about tunnels. Tesla Motors chief Elon Musk, above in 2015, has been tweeting a lot about tunnels. (Ringo H.W. Chiu / Associated Press) Melissa Etehad Elon Musk is apparently turning\u00a0his focus from the heavens to the earth, proposing on Twitter that he plans to dig a tunnel that could reduce Los Angeles traffic.\u00a0 The often outspoken Chief Executive of SpaceX and Tesla Motors Inc. last month told his 6 million Twitter followers : \u201cTraffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...\u201d\u00a0He dubbed the project \u201cThe Boring Company\u201d and added \u201cI am actually going to do this.\u201d Early Wednesday, he backed that up, tweeting\u00a0he\u00a0had\u00a0made \u201cexciting progress on the tunnel front\u201d and intends to\u00a0 \u201cstart digging in a month or so.\u201d \u00a0 Considering Musk\u2019s ability to turn science fiction into reality \u2014\u00a0he has, after all, landed a rocket upright and made electric cars cool \u2014 it\u2019s tough to know whether this is a serious proposal, or a quip from a tech world luminary who has previously suggested reality is not real . That\u2019s not the only question left unanswered. When asked the location of the tunnel, Musk tweeted it will be \u201cStarting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX.\u201d Tunnels generally have two ends, but Musk offered only one, heightening the intrigue.\u00a0 Could the tunnel be a subterranean super highway? Such a proposal would certainly match Musk\u2019s history of grandiose projects \u2014\u00a0and later\u00a0Wednesday he reiterated his goal of traffic mitigation to tech publication the Verge, stating that \u201c without tunnels, we will all be in traffic hell forever .\u201d But building a massive  tunnel in the Southland could be harder than rocket science considering the\u00a0bureaucratic nightmare Musk would face\u00a0gaining approval from multiple municipalities, not to mention the\u00a0existing infrastructure he would need to avoid and the stupendous cost (the first phase of New York City\u2019s newly opened Second Avenue subway cost $4.5 billion for just two miles of track and three stations).\u00a0 Perhaps he is\u00a0alluding to an underground\u00a0test track for hyperloop technology \u2014\u00a0low-friction tubes through which passengers or cargo can be shot in pods? Musk popularized the idea, but so far let other entrepreneurs run with it.\u00a0 What if it were just a short tunnel, perhaps adding egress to SpaceX employee parking? Practical, but maybe not ambitious enough for a man set on sending humans to Mars. For its part, SpaceX declined to comment.\u00a0 One thing is certain: Musk hasn\u2019t yet applied for permits with the\u00a0Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering. \u201cWe are not aware of any permit applications for a tunnel beneath the Public Right of Way. Any such permit application for a tunnel beneath the Public Right of Way would require City Council approval,\" agency spokeswoman Mary Nemick said. Perhaps Musk intends to dig only below\u00a0property leased by SpaceX,\u00a0known formally as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. The Hawthorne facility is owned by Chambers Street Properties, which bought it in 2014 for $46 million . Chambers Street Properties did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0 But if Los Angeles\u2019 transportation future lies beneath its streets,\u00a0Musk would be the one\u00a0to pull it off. He has eccentric ideas, and he often executes them.\u00a0 And considering President Trump\u2019s desire to ramp up American infrastructure projects, a costly tunnel dig\u00a0may sound a little less far-fetched. Musk has frequently sought government funding for his ventures and is already in close contact with Trump, having met him this week in the White House . On Tuesday night, Musk tweeted favorably about Trump\u2019s secretary of State nominee, former Exxon Chief Executive\u00a0Rex Tillerson.\u00a0\u00a0 Hours later, Musk changed the subject to digging on Twitter, where his bio lists \u201cTunnels\u201d alongside the names of the companies he runs.\u00a0 ",

The two-times Oscar-winner has made clear his affection for the tiny Polski Fiat 126P, which became ubiquitous in the 1970s when impoverished Poland was part of the Soviet eastern bloc.

Hanx pic.twitter.com/e5es8RoR1s \u2014 Tom Hanks (@tomhanks) October 29, 2016 A flurry of tweets last fall showing the actor alongside various models of the auto \u2014 nicknamed \"Maluch,\" or \"small one\" in Polish \u2014 caught the attention of 42-year-old Monika Jaskolska, who is from the southern town of Bielsko-Biala where the car was made. Despite Hanks' estimated net worth of $350 million, Jaskolska decided to buy him one as a gift. Since then it would be an understatement to say her idea has gained wheels. Jaskolska has managed to raise more than $2,000 on Facebook to buy and revamp a 126P, she told NBC News Wednesday. She looked everywhere, posting advertisements online and scouring fan clubs and forums. She eventually found one in the northeastern town of Suwalki, where a man, who asked to remain anonymous, offered her a turquoise blue model \u2014 for free. A Fiat 126p that fans have bought for actor Tom Hanks as a souvenir, sits on a trailer in Suwalki, Poland on Saturday. Michal Kosc / AP Jaskolska received the two-door car last week and Polish rally driver Rafa\u0142 Sonik has offered to \"pimp it up\" to value of up to $10,000. To tackle the problem of getting it to Hanks, she said Polish national airline LOT has offered to transport the vehicle to the U.S. free of charge. Jaskolska will donate the unused funds she originally raised to a local hospital. The economical 126P was first manufactured in 1971 by Polski Fiat, which built Italian Fiat cars under licence behind the Iron Curtain. More than than three million were made before production ended in 2000, but, aside from an unlikely revival in Cuba, the car never saw large exports beyond Poland. Jaskolska hasn't been in contact with \"Toma Hanksa,\" as the actor is known in Polish, but hopes she can get the car to him soon. \"It is not like I have [his] private number,\" she said.

And if they don\u2019t want to do, that\u2019s fine. If they do wanna do, then I will work toward that end. I want to do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally,\u201d Trump exclusively told World News Tonight Anchor David Muir during an interview at the White House. \u201cBut do I feel it works? Absolutely, I feel it works.\u201d Trump explained it's important to re-consider the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique because, \"We\u2019re not playing on an even field.\u201d \"When they\u2019re chopping off the heads of our people, and other people. When they\u2019re chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East - when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding? As far as I\u2019m concerned, we have to fight fire with fire,\" he said. \"I\u2019m going to go with what they say,\" Trump said of Mattis and Pompeo. \"But I have spoken as recently as 24 hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence and I asked them the question. 'Does it work? Does torture work' - and the answer was 'Yes, absolutely.'\" During the 2016 campaign, Trump vowed to bring back the use of waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques. \"Not since medieval times have people seen what's going on. I would bring back waterboarding and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,\" Trump told Muir during the ABC News New Hampshire Republican Primary Debate in February of 2016. But Trump's position on the use of waterboarding seems to differ from some of his Cabinet picks. In an interview with the New York Times last year, Trump said he was \u201cimpressed\u201d by a recommendation from Mattis, who at the time was under consideration for Defense Secretary. \u201cI said, what do you think of waterboarding? He said \u2014 I was surprised \u2014 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve never found it to be useful.\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.\u2019 And I was very impressed by that answer. I was surprised, because he\u2019s known as being like the toughest guy,\" Trump told the New York Times. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA Director, Pompeo was asked whether he would comply if Trump issued a presidential order calling for the reinstatement of enhanced interrogation techniques that currently fall outside the Army Field Manual. \"Absolutely not. Moreover, I can't imagine I would be asked that by the President-elect,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind about the limitations placed not only on the DOD but on the intelligence agency, and I\u2019ll always comply with the law.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments today come amid reports of an administration draft order indicating the president is considering a review of terror interrogations and the potential re-opening of CIA \u201cblack site\u201d prisons outside the U.S. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Wednesday that the draft order was \"not a White House document\" but would not provide further comment. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Federal Options on Chicago Crime Limited Despite Trump Tweet By michael tarm, associated press CHICAGO \u0097 Jan 25, 2017, 7:28 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Set to Sign Executive Actions on Immigration 0 Shares Email President Donald Trump is again warning Chicago about its high number of homicides, saying on Twitter that he is ready to \"send in the Feds\" if the nation's third largest city can't reduce the number of killings on its own. Trump has offered no specifics on what kind of federal intervention he envisions, but many steps he could potentially contemplate pose practical and even constitutional obstacles. The president tweeted Tuesday night: \"If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\" Trump had tweeted before he took office that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel should ask for federal help if he couldn't bring down the homicide rate. Last year, the death toll soared to 762 \u2014 the most killings in the city in nearly two decades and more than New York and Los Angeles combined. Emanuel said Wednesday he welcomes federal help in curbing violence, though he cautioned against a strictly \"tough and rough\" approach. He told a local TV station Tuesday that additional federal intervention could include funds to help hire more police officers. Here's a look at some of the issues: \u2014\u2014\u2014 NATIONAL GUARD The most direct \u2014 and most extreme \u2014 intervention would be sending National Guard troops into Chicago. Both the U.S. president and the Illinois governor have the authority to mobilize the Illinois National Guard. But a federal statute, the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, prohibits the deployment of federal troops to do the jobs of domestic police. While a president could seek to use narrow, rarely invoked used exceptions in that statute, civil libertarians would likely protest any such move. When asked in August about the notion of deploying the National Guard in Chicago, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner ruled it out. He said he had discussed the idea with police, community leaders and the National Guard, but concluded \"no thoughtful leader thinks that's a good idea or would really provide a solution.\" Sending armed troops to stand on neighborhood street corners could also undermine what city of Chicago officials have said is a key to improving policing on Chicago's South and West Sides, where most homicides occur: Building trust between law enforcement and residents in those minority communities. Emanuel said Wednesday sending in guardsmen would be \"antithetical\" to trust-building. \u2014\u2014\u2014 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT The federal government's highest profile intervention in recent years was a yearlong civil-rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department by the Justice Department launched in 2015 under then-President Barack Obama. A damning report released just before Trump's inauguration cited excessive use of force and other problems that not only violated constitutional rights but hampered crime-fighting. Such findings are supposed to trigger a process that, under Obama, typically led to police-reform plans overseen by a U.S. judge. Some activists worry that Trump \u2014 endorsed by Chicago's police union during the campaign \u2014 won't apply as much pressure on Chicago police to change. The current U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon in Chicago came under pressure when selected to be the top federal law enforcement official in Chicago three years ago to put violent crime at the top of the city's agenda. But from the start of his tenure, he tempered expectations, saying repeatedly that communities couldn't arrest their way out of the problem of violence and that a more holistic approach is required that included addressing that socio-economic factors underpinning crime. \u2014\u2014\u2014 THE MAYOR Among the list of things Mayor Emanuel told WTTW's \"Chicago Tonight\" the federal government could do was to devote even more resources to tracking the flow of illegal guns into Chicago from neighboring Indiana, where gun laws aren't as strict as in Illinois; as well as putting more money into federal after-school programs and \"investing in neighborhoods that are hard hit by poverty (that) become a breeding ground for violence.\" \"Over the years the federal government (has) stepped back their resources, which we have stepped up,\" said Emanuel, a Democrat who once worked as Obama's White House chief of staff. After broaching the issue of social programs, he added: \"The federal government can be a partner, and to be honest they haven't been for decades.\" He said the city has \"good relationships\" with federal agencies, something Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson echoed in responding directly to Trump's Tuesday night tweet. Johnson said his department is \"more than willing to work with the federal government to build on our partnerships\" with the Justice Department, FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and others. \u2014\u2014\u2014 GANGS Federal prosecutors in Chicago have used racketeering and gun laws to go after gangs, who police blame for much of Chicago's deadly violence. One of the largest street-gang cases in recent Chicago history wrapped up this month, with jurors convicting the core leadership of the notorious Hobos street gang on trial for an alleged racketeering conspiracy that prosecutors say included at least nine killings. But many gang experts point to an unintended consequence of prosecuting gang leaders: Breaking up a gang's command structure can often lead to more inter-gang rivalry and, therefore, to even more violence. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Michael Tarm on Twitter at http://twitter.com/mtarm 0 Shares ",

Reuters/Albert Gea Email Facebook is once again trying to strengthen its reputation as a place for news as it tries to figure out how to curb misinformation from spreading on the site. The social network on Wednesday announced a\u00a0 major revamp to its trending topics feature \u00a0-- that section on the right-hand side of your news feed that lists news topics that are popular on Facebook. Gone is the personalized interest-based list of topics. Now everyone in a geographic region will see the same trending topics. The tech industry saw a lot of ups and downs this year. Facebook promised to fight fake news on its social network and launched its live video fe... With its 1.79 billion users, Facebook is playing an influential societal role as more people look to the social network to get their news. Over 40 percent of American adults get their news from Facebook,\u00a0 according to \u00a0the Pew Research Center and Knight Foundation. But the company has been grappling with its role in the media industry as it tries to find the line between being a distributor of news and\u00a0 taking responsibility \u00a0for what kinds of news stories gain traction on the site. That\u2019s been a touchy subject for Facebook, as people argued\u00a0 misinformation spread on Facebook helped Donald Trump win \u00a0the election. Some also blamed Facebook for creating \u201c filter bubbles ,\u201d in which people only see stuff on the social network that already aligns with what they believe, thanks to the company\u2019s algorithms. In addition to doing away with the personalized trending topics list, there are two other big changes to the section that will take effect immediately. First, instead of just seeing a bare-bones topic, like \u201cSaturn\u201d or \u201cX-men,\u201d two things that had been trending for me, you\u2019ll see a full headline of one of the news stories about that topic. Second, Facebook is changing the way the topics are selected. Right now, the topics are chosen based on how many people on Facebook are engaging with it. With the new changes, Facebook will look at the number of outlets posting stories on a particular topic, and decide its inclusion based on engagement around that group of articles. \u201cThis should surface trending topics quicker, be more effective at capturing a broader range of news and events from around the world and also help ensure that topics reflect real world events being covered by multiple news outlets,\u201d Will Cathcart, vice president of product management, said in a statement. This is the second time Facebook has made big changes to the trending topics feature. Before August, each topic was accompanied by a short description. But Facebook\u00a0 nixed those descriptions \u00a0after a\u00a0 major controversy last year. \u00a0After reports that Facebook was trying to suppress news from conservative outlets, the company put the new system in place.

    "text": "EPA Contract Freeze, Media Blackout Leave States Confused By michael biesecker and john flesher, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 25, 2017, 9:56 AM ET 0 Shares Play ABCNews.com WATCH Donald Trump's Pick for EPA, Scott Pruitt, Calls Human Activity a Factor in Changing Climate 0 Shares Email A Trump administration freeze on new Environmental Protection Agency contracts and grant awards raised fears that states and other recipients could lose essential funding for drinking water protection, hazardous waste oversight and a host of other programs \u2014 while a communications blackout left them dangling in uncertainty. The agency also took a potential first step Tuesday toward potentially killing environmental rules completed as President Barack Obama's term wound down. At least 30 were targeted in the Federal Register for delayed implementation, including updated pollution rulings for several states, renewable fuel standards and limits on the amount of formaldehyde that can leach from wood products. President Donald Trump signed a directive shortly after his inauguration ordering a \"freeze pending review\" on all federal rules issued by agencies but not yet in effect. But what the administration described Tuesday as a temporary suspension of new business activities at the EPA, including issuing work assignments to contractors, sowed widespread confusion about its reach. EPA contracts with outside vendors for a wide array of services, from engineering and research science to janitorial supplies. Emails to staff banning press releases, blog updates or posts to the agency's social media accounts contributed to the information vacuum. \"Is President Trump the only one allowed to tweet in government right now?\" Liz Purchia, who was EPA press secretary for the Obama administration, said in an email to The Associated Press. \"I just keep thinking how thankful I am there isn't an emergency disaster EPA needs to respond to right now. ... It's one thing to get your ducks in a row, but to put a gag order on public servants and all agency activities, not only prevents them from doing their jobs. It puts our country at risk.\" Similar orders barring external communications have been issued at agencies within the departments of Transportation, Agriculture and Interior. \" Vladimir Putin must be proud,\" said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization. \"The EPA, like all federal agencies, is funded by taxpayer dollars, and Americans have the right to know what's being done to protect or harm public health and the environment.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday he had no specific information on the blackout but added, \"I don't think it's any surprise that when there's an administration turnover, that we're going to review the policies.\" Doug Ericksen, communications director for Trump's transition team at EPA, said the communications clampdown probably would be lifted by the end of the week. \"We're just trying to get a handle on everything and make sure what goes out reflects the priorities of the new administration,\" Ericksen said. The freeze on EPA contracts and grants won't apply to pollution cleanup efforts or infrastructure construction activities, he said. The agency said later the delay was for a review of transactions in the works and it should be finished by Friday. Still, confusion reigned in states led by Democrats and Republicans alike that depend on EPA funding. \"We are unsure of the immediate or long-term impact\" to programs in Montana involving wastewater treatment, underground storage tanks, air quality and more, said Kristi Ponozzo of the state Department of Environmental Quality. Utah's DEQ is \"seeking additional information so we can understand the impact of this action on our ability to administer critical programs,\" said Alan Matheson, executive director. Members of Michigan's congressional delegation raised concern that the freeze could jeopardize aid to Flint, a city still dealing with lead contamination of its water supply. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged the Trump administration to drop the media blackout and contracting holdup. \"This decision could have damaging implications? for communities across New York state and the country, from delaying testing for lead in schools to restricting efforts to keep drinking water clean to holding up much-needed funding to revitalize toxic brownfield sites,\" Schumer said. The executive director for the advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, Jeff Ruch, said the Trump orders go beyond what has occurred in prior presidential transitions. Ruch noted that key posts at EPA have not yet been filled with Republican appointees, including Trump's nominee for EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt. That means new senior personnel are not in place to make key decisions. Environmentalists said the orders were causing low morale among EPA staff already beleaguered by repeated criticism from Trump and Pruitt. Staff at the Agriculture Department's Agricultural Research Service also received orders not to issue any news releases, photos, fact sheets and social media posts. After an email of the order leaked to the media, the agency said it would rescind the memo. \"Gag orders that freeze communications with the public and government officials go against basic notions of government transparency and accountability,\" said Michael Macleod-Ball of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Flesher reported from Traverse City, Michigan. Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Darlene Superville in Washington, Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, and Dan Elliott in Denver contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow AP environmental reporter Biesecker at Twitter.com/mbieseck 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Protesters Hoist 'RESIST' Banner From Crane Near White House By ben nuckols, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 25, 2017, 3:59 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Recapping the Women's March on Washington 0 Shares Email The morning after President Donald Trump issued orders to delay environmental rules and restart pipeline projects, seven Greenpeace protesters climbed a 270-foot tall construction crane blocks from the White House and unfurled a massive orange and yellow banner with the word, \"RESIST.\" The banner encouraging opposition to Trump's agenda was clearly visible from the grounds of the White House for several hours on Wednesday, and from some angles it appeared to hover over the building. Protesters hoped it would get under his skin. \"There's nothing that irritates him more than to know he's not popular and we don't like him,\" one of the protesters, Karen Topakian, told The Associated Press in an interview conducted via FaceTime from high up on the crane. District of Columbia police took a hands-off approach while the protesters suspended themselves from harnesses and ropes below the crane's huge arm. Police closed three city blocks to traffic and appeared content to wait until they climbed down to be arrested. The protesters scaled the crane before dawn at a sprawling construction site that was previously home to The Washington Post. They revealed the banner after 9 a.m. and remained atop the crane into the afternoon before beginning a slow descent. John Evans, 46, a carpenter who works on the site, said the protesters were clearly experienced climbers, noting that they were moving their legs and shifting positions to maintain their blood circulation. \"Look how organized they are. They have the same equipment that I use every day,\" he said. \"They're professionals. Amateurs couldn't stay up there that long.\" The protest comes a day after Trump signed orders intended to restart construction of two oil pipelines, the Dakota Access and the Keystone XL. Former president Barack Obama halted the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015 and the Army Corps of Engineers blocked the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline in December after months of protests led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which gets drinking water from a reservoir in the pipeline's path. Also on Tuesday, Trump's administration moved to delay implementation of at least 30 environmental rules and froze new Environmental Protection Agency contracts and grant awards. Topakian said the action was intended to protest \"all the things he's promised to do to push our country backwards.\" A few dozen people standing in the streets below took photos, but many just paused briefly before moving on. David Presgraves, 27, and Victoria Oms, 26, who work nearby in nonprofit communications, said they agreed with the message. Both participated in the Women's March on Washington on Saturday. \"The pipelines have got to stop,\" Presgraves said. \"There's no respect for the native people, no respect for the environment.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Sarah Brumfield and AP video journalist Jason Dorn contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Email There are about 313,000 people in Texas who have been forced into prostitution or some other sort of work, researchers estimate in what they say is the broadest estimate ever conducted of human trafficking in Texas. Roughly 234,000 of those people work under conditions of involuntary servitude or debt bondage, while the other 79,000 are children or young adults who were pushed into prostitution through coercion or some form of deception, according to the study released Tuesday by the Institute on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault at the University of Texas' School of Social Work. The authors said their estimates are conservative and that they hope their study will serve as a reference point for law enforcement tasked with reducing trafficking, including those in Houston who are gearing up for a surge in sex trafficking ahead of the Feb. 5 Super Bowl . Authorities have acknowledged that Texas, as one of the largest states in the country, is a hub for human trafficking in the U.S. and that the problem is particularly acute in Houston. The scope of human trafficking has been difficult to measure largely because data has focused primarily on identified victims, according to the report. So researchers in 2014 began collaborating with other groups on an extensive mapping project that mined various databases, surveyed social service agencies that aid victims, and used other sources to obtain a more accurate tally. \"This is our first glimpse into the scope and impact of human trafficking in Texas,\" said Noel Busch-Armendariz, the institute's director. \"Few states have this kind of insight into the number of people being exploited. And more importantly, each count reflects a human being living among us in slavery-like conditions.\" Among the findings are that children and young adults who are homeless or in the foster care system have the highest risk of becoming involved in sex trafficking. The study also determined that the largest number of victims of labor trafficking are found in construction, cleaning services and restaurant kitchen work. 0 Shares ",

Uncredited/AP The Amazon bestseller list has become something of a political barometer of late. Recently Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis's memoir March rose to the top after President Trump criticized him for questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. Since the election, Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir that has become a guide to working class America has been at or near the top of the list. Now the classic dystopian novel 1984, written by George Orwell and published in 1948, is number one. The Amazon best seller list is updated hourly so it can swiftly track a surge in a book's popularity. A spokesman for Signet Classics which currently publishes 1984 said sales have increased almost 10,000 percent since the inauguration and moved noticeably upwards on Sunday. That's when Counselor to the President Kelly Anne Conway appeared on Meet the Press. When host Chuck Todd challenged the Trump administration's assertions about the size of the Inauguration Day crowd, Conway responded by saying that the administration had \" alternative facts.\" That phrase drew a lot of attention.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trade experts say there really is room to make major change in the two-decade-old agreement. A renegotiation could well lead to a better deal for all three countries. But it will require the United States to make concessions that the Trump administration may be wary of offering. If not approached carefully, revamping an agreement that has created the economic underpinning of major industries would risk American jobs as well as higher prices for consumers. And the closer the Trump administration gets to blowing up the deal, the larger those risks loom. Before diving into what could go wrong \u2014 and right \u2014 as President Trump looks to rework Nafta, it\u2019s worth starting with the basics. Photo At the 1992 signing ceremony in San Antonio with Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Brian Mulroney of Canada, George H.W. Bush called the North American Free Trade Agreement a \u201cturning point in the history of our three countries.\u201d Credit Marcy Nighswander/Associated Press What is Nafta? On Oct. 7, 1992, President George H.W. Bush stood in San Antonio flanked by the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Canada. \u201cThis meeting marks a turning point in the history of our three countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are creating the largest, richest and most productive market in the entire world.\u201d Mr. Bush\u2019s successor, Bill Clinton, was the one to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through a divided Congress. By 1994, the three countries were entwined in a trade deal that, in its 22 chapters covering 309 pages, lashed their economies together. It eliminated most tariffs on goods traded between the nations, and set in place processes to get rid of regulatory and other barriers. The idea was that over time a company in Ohio could do business with a firm in Ontario as easily as it did with one in Indiana. What have been its results? As the election showed, whether Nafta was a good thing for voters in the United States or a bad one continues to be argued. But there are some things most people who study these things can agree upon. The North American economy really does work as an integrated whole. United States exports to Mexico, for example, are now 3.5 times their 1993 level when adjusted for inflation. They have risen more than twice as fast as the overall economy. Trade between the United States and Canada has been pretty well balanced over time, but the United States has had about a $60 billion per year trade deficit with Mexico, importing more than it exports. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the auto industry, for example, supply chains crisscross North American borders , with work of different complexity done in different countries. Your Ford made in Michigan might contain a dashboard made in Juarez and a transmission made in Windsor, Ontario. This complex supply chain has helped make the U.S. auto industry competitive with manufacturers in Asia and Europe, which also contain both low-wage and higher-wage countries with different specialties. The impact on jobs and incomes in the United States is less clear. Economists broadly supportive of free trade deals argue that Nafta essentially encouraged a shift of jobs in the United States toward higher-value, more productive work, raising wages and having negligible impact on the total number of jobs. Those more skeptical of the deal view it as having created low-wage competition across the border in Mexico that accelerated the loss of manufacturing jobs. (See a more detailed explanation of the competing views here and here .) One way to reconcile those two views: Nafta may have increased overall G.D.P. and average incomes in the United States \u2014 but at the same time contributed to the decline in well-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs that tended to be concentrated in certain cities and among certain groups of people, mostly blue-collar men. Can President Trump kill the deal? In theory, yes. But it would be a mess, particularly if he tried to do it right off the bat. Article 2205 of Nafta says that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after giving notice. But if President Trump did that, it would unleash disarray in major industries; ruin the ability to have good-faith negotiations with Canada and Mexico; and most likely cause a legal showdown with Congress (which passed Nafta all those years ago and wouldn\u2019t want it abrogated without a say). That doesn\u2019t sound like what the Trump administration has cooked up. It\u2019s more likely to reopen the deal. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we can renegotiate the deal that\u2019s both advantageous to us and advantageous to Mexico, that\u2019s a win-win for both countries,\u201d said Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, in his confirmation hearing. Will Canada and Mexico come to the table for a renegotiation? Sure looks that way. The White House has announced plans to meet separately with the leaders of both countries, and all signals are that they\u2019re up for new talks. In the case of Mexico, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has said he wants talks to cover a wider gamut than trade alone \u2014 implicitly threatening to become less cooperative on fighting drug trafficking and other frontiers if the Trump administration is excessively punitive in trade talks. And, of course, Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement today that he will build a wall on the border \u2014 and that Mexico will eventually pay for it \u2014 could cause Mexico to rethink its outlook on trade negotiations altogether. So what is the United States going to ask for? We don\u2019t know for sure, but some hints have emerged. One strong possibility would be to focus on \u201crules of origin\u201d governing what counts as an automobile or other finished good produced within the free trade area. For example, a steering wheel might be assembled in Mexico but include parts made in China; the rules of origin state how many of those parts can come from China while still counting as a Mexican steering wheel and thus enjoy the benefits of the free trade zone.

McGrath also said Wednesday the 92-year-old Bush continues to work with physical therapists to help him regain strength. The nation's 41st president was admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital on Jan. 14 for breathing difficulties. He later was moved to intensive care when doctors inserted a breathing tube. The tube was removed after a couple of days. He was moved from the ICU Monday. Former first lady Barbara Bush spent five days at the same hospital for treatment of bronchitis.

Haley won strong support despite her lack of foreign policy experience. USA TODAY NETWORK Former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley is the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images) WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is considering actions that would reduce the U.S. commitment to the United Nations and evaluate whether the United States should pull out of multi-national treaties, officials said. The results could be reduced American funding for the U.N. agencies and withdrawal from treaties like the Paris climate accord reached by the Obama administration, said the two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the actions were not completed yet. Trump has criticized some multi-national agreements and the United Nations, the latter in especially harsh terms after the Security Council voted in December to condemn Israel over settlement activity in disputed areas also claimed by Palestinians. The Obama administration abstained in that vote instead of using the U.S. veto in the Security Council. After tweeting that the U.N. had become\u00a0\u201cjust a club for people to get together, talk, and have a good time,\" Trump told reporters in December that \"there is such tremendous potential, but it is not living up ... When do you see the United Nations solving problems? They don't. They cause problems.\u201d Read more: Trump orders clamp down on immigrant 'sanctuary cities,' pushes border wall He added: \u201cSo, if it lives up to the potential, it's a great thing. And if it doesn't, it's a waste of time and money.\u201d The New York Times reported on one draft order that calls for ending funding for any U.N. agency that engages in certain activity, such allowing membership to\u00a0the Palestinian Authority or Palestinian Liberation Organization. Another draft order, the Times said, calls for review of multi-nation treaties, with recommendations on which ones the United States\u00a0should leave. Trump is considering actions in these areas, the two officials said, but they declined to detail them because final decisions have not been made. The first of the two draft orders, titled \u201cAuditing and Reducing U.S. Funding of International Organizations\u201d and obtained by The New York Times, calls for terminating funding for any United Nations agency or other international body that meets any one of several criteria. Those criteria include organizations that give full membership to the Palestinian Authority or Palestine Liberation Organization, or support programs that fund abortion or any activity that circumvents sanctions against Iran or North Korea. 10 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kumNCN NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "Tostitos' new bag wants to fight drunk post-Super Bowl driving Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY Published 7:35 p.m. ET Jan. 25, 2017 | Updated 22 minutes ago 47 Shares x Share File this under a great idea. PepsiCo's Tostitos snack brand has unveiled a limited-edition 'Party Safe' bag just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 5.  Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Tostitos may not be advertising in this year's Super Bowl , but it still plans to have its presence felt during, and after, the \"Big Game.\" In an attempt to raise awareness for responsible driving, the chip maker has partnered with Mother's Against Drunk Driving and Uber to create\u00a0\"alcohol sensor bags,\" special Tostitos bags that can tell if you've been drinking while watching the Patriots take on the Falcons. \"We wanted to make sure that as people were celebrating, they were also partying responsibly,\"\u00a0says Jennifer Saenz, chief marketing officer for Tostitos maker Frito-Lay. \"We thought it was an opportunity to begin a conversation with consumers about drinking and driving, and about responsibility, in a really fun and engaging way.\" The bag is not a breathalyzer and won't give you an exact measurement of your blood alcohol level, instead opting to look for traces of adult beverages in your breath. A sensor at the top measures your breath, while lights below the logo flash\u00a0the results. If the bag doesn't detect alcohol, the front will light up green. If alcohol is present then the front of the bag will flash a red steering wheel with a \"don't drink and drive\" message along the bottom. On the plus side, the front will also flash an Uber code that you can use to get a discount for an Uber ride to help get you home. USA TODAY was able to get its hands on one of\u00a0bags\u00a0and can confirm that the sensor does indeed work. via GIPHY \"We wanted to really think beyond the Super Bowl, beyond Houston, and\u00a0think about what impact we could make in other settings,\" says Saenz about the inspiration behind the bag. \"For us it was a pretty natural thought to land on those parties that people are having on gameday,\" continues Saenz, noting that \"more often than not there's alcoholic\u00a0beverages there.\" Frito-Lay says that the sensor bags are part of a limited supply and sadly won't be available to the public. Through its partnership with Uber, however, it will be giving out 25,000\u00a0$10 Uber discounts to those who purchase any of its chips between now and the Super Bowl as part of its effort to make sure people get home safely. The codes, which will work for both new and existing Uber users, can be activated by simply typing in the last five digits of the bag of chips' UPC barcode after the Super Bowl ends. To help further raise awareness for the partnership the company has partnered with Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker on a video spot. Walker lost an aunt and uncle to a drunk driver following the 2013 Super Bowl, which he played in as a member of the San Francisco 49ers. \"We want to make sure everyone gets home safely,\" says Saenz.

USA TODAY Sports Usain Bolt (JAM) after winning the men's 4x100m relay final in the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games at Estadio Olimpico Joao Havelange. (Photo: James Lang, USA TODAY Sports) The focus of the latest Olympic doping scandal is on Usain Bolt. Of course it is. He\u2019s the rock star in the story, the first sprinter in history to win three gold medals at three consecutive Olympic Games, only to learn after the fact that he has done it only twice. Because his Jamaican relay teammate, Nesta Carter, was found to have cheated when the International Olympic Committee went back and reanalyzed hundreds of urine samples from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the whole Jamaican team \u2014 including Bolt \u2014 was stripped of its gold medals Wednesday. Because Bolt is so famous, the sports world\u2019s knee-jerk reaction probably is to feel a little sorry for him. He wasn\u2019t caught cheating. His teammate was. Yet he loses one of his Olympic gold medals anyway. Those are the rules; if one teammate cheats, he or she takes the whole relay down with them. You can feel a touch of sympathy for Bolt if you\u2019d like, but I won\u2019t. Rather, I\u2019d like to know if Bolt knew Carter was cheating. Performance-enhancing drugs have ravaged our faith and trust in Olympic sports for more than 40 years now. While that assuredly bothers spectators, organizers and sponsors, it really irks the athletes who are competing clean and must go up against those who are not. RELATED COVERAGE: Usain Bolt to lose Olympic gold after teammate caught doping Those clean athletes know. They know who\u2019s cheating. Sometimes the suspicions become so obvious that they can\u2019t help themselves from talking about it in public. Those athletes, people like swimmers Shirley Babashoff, Janet Evans and Lilly King, are the true heroes of sports\u2019 Steroids Era. So, if Bolt knew Carter was doping, why didn\u2019t he speak up?\u00a0 Cynically, we know why. What teammate would speak up and kill his or her chances for an Olympic gold medal? The very rare one, that\u2019s who. If you want to feel sorry for anyone in this saga, your sympathy would be much better placed with the second-place finishers in the men\u2019s 4x100 relay in Beijing, the sprinters from Trinidad and Tobago. Or the third-place team from Japan. Or, better yet, the fourth-place finishers, Brazil. A regal Olympic medal ceremony often is the peak of a young athlete\u2019s life. All those years of training, and, finally, a celebration of victory. Because Carter chose to cheat, the runners from Trinidad and Tobago and Japan were deprived of their rightful places on the medal podium. And the poor Brazilians? They were left on the sidelines to watch a ceremony that they should have been in. They never got a chance to stand on the third rung of the podium, to watch their flag be raised in the Bird\u2019s Nest, to swell with pride in front of thousands with a medal around their necks. Instead, sometime in the next few weeks, packages will arrive at their doors, and when they open them, they will each find an Olympic medal. Perhaps they will be alone. Perhaps a friend or family member will be with them. They assuredly will take the medal out of the box and put it around their neck. Hundreds of photographers will not be there to record the moment. Nor will thousands of fans. The public joy they should have felt more than eight years ago will be reduced to private exhilaration. Perhaps they\u2019ll take a selfie.

    "text": "Here's how voter fraud once tipped an election \u2014 and why that doesn't happen very often Voting Election workers in Colorado open mail-in ballots. Election workers in Colorado open mail-in ballots. (Marc Piscotty / Getty Images) Kurtis Lee Contact Reporter From the outset, it was a spirited battle between two Cuban-born politicians with deep roots in the city. But the 1997 Miami mayoral race ended in shame, becoming one of the worst cases of voter fraud in the country. At the time, Mayor Joe Carollo was seeking a second term\u00a0and faced a challenge from Xavier Suarez, the city\u2019s first Cuban mayor, who\u00a0had served in the 1980s and was waging a political comeback.\u00a0That November, Suarez defeated Carollo in a runoff election. Yet something was amiss. Carollo\u2019s campaign, heeding tips from local political operatives, claimed that absentee ballots in the runoff were forged and even paid for by representatives of the Suarez campaign. An investigation found nearly 400 fraudulent absentee ballots were cast by, among others, dead people and felons. \u201cThis scheme to defraud, literally and figuratively, stole the ballot from the hands of every honest voter in the city of Miami,\u201d said Circuit\u00a0Court Judge Thomas S. Wilson Jr. in his ruling at the time. Wilson, who ruled that no evidence was presented to indicate that Suarez knew about the fraud,\u00a0threw out the results of the election, leaving the city with an interim mayor for several weeks in spring 1998. Eventually, Carollo returned to his position as mayor, and about 20 people \u2014 many from Suarez\u2019s campaign \u2014 were arrested. While\u00a0the Miami case involved manipulation of absentee ballots \u2014 \u00a0not noncitizens voting\u00a0or people faking their identity at the polls, which have been the main focus of Republican-led efforts to crack down on voter fraud \u2014\u00a0it was among the most egregious examples of voter fraud to date. It was also rare.\u00a0Nationwide, studies show, voter fraud is almost nonexistent. This week, President Trump \u2014 without providing evidence \u00a0\u2014 said\u00a0that between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes were cast in the November presidential election. White House officials said the claim was\u00a0based on studies and evidence presented to the president. \u201cI will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and even,\u00a0those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday. The statement from Trump led to a strong rebuke by some in his party. Jon Husted , a Republican who is Ohio\u2019s top elections official, said his state investigated voter fraud in past elections and came up with nothing. \u201cWe conducted a review 4 years ago in Ohio & already have a statewide review of 2016 election underway. Easy to vote, hard to cheat #Ohio,\u201d he tweeted. Earlier this week, in response to multiple questions about Trump\u2019s unproven claims, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said a Pew Center study had shown\u00a0that 14% of people who voted in 2008 were noncitizens. But there is no such Pew study. Pew did find in 2012 that 1.8 million deceased individuals were still listed as voters, and that 2.75 million people were registered to vote in multiple states. But it found no evidence that false votes were cast. \u201cAre there occasional, isolated incidents of fraud? Yes,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles\u00a0who specializes in election law.\u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s in small-scale local elections and rare.\u2026 I\u2019ve seen no factual evidence about President Trump\u2019s claims.\u201d\u00a0 Indeed, Levitt recently conducted a comprehensive report into voter fraud that is widely cited by scholars. He found 31 credible instance between 2000 and 2014 of voter impersonation out of more than 1 billion votes cast. He examined ballots from every federal election in that time frame. In 2007, the Bush administration released a five-year investigation into voter fraud that turned up nothing. \u201cThis claim that millions of people are voting illegally, that\u2019s just ludicrous,\u201d said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert who teaches at UC Irvine and has studied voter fraud.\u00a0 That Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2.9 million ballots may help explain why he seems to have such a strong interest in persuading people that millions of illegal ballots were cast. Others believe Trump is attempting to influence future voting laws. \u201cIt\u2019s clear President Trump is amplifying a false message of voter fraud in an effort to encourage a policy agenda that will silence voters who may disagree with him,\u201d said Danielle Lang, deputy director of voting rights at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \u201cHis claims are to stimulate lawmakers to move forward in introducing voter suppression laws like voter ID,\u00a0 even though several federal courts have found these tactics to be discriminatory.\u201d So far, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election.\u00a0 In Des Moines, local authorities caught a woman attempting to vote twice for Trump. Also,\u00a0in a case recalling the 1997 mayoral controversy, two women were charged with election fraud in Miami-Dade County after they allegedly altered absentee ballots and submitted false voter registration applications. Most of the fraudulent ballots were cast for a Republican in a local race. Researchers at Dartmouth College \u00a0are currently conducting an extensive study of abnormal voting patterns in the 2016 election. They looked into voting by noncitizens and dead people, among other things. So far, they have come up with nothing.\u00a0 In October, weeks before the election, the National Assn. of Secretaries of State, which consists of a bipartisan group of top elections officials from around the country,\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0pushing back against Trump\u2019s claims of a \u201crigged\u201d election.\u00a0 This week they issued a follow-up statement to address Trump\u2019s claims. Their response?\u00a0 \u201cSecretaries of state expressed their confidence in the systemic integrity of our election process as a bipartisan group, and they stand behind that statement today,\u201d the group said.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss In a fiery State of the State, Brown returned to a familiar conclusion. \u00a0 President Trump signed executive orders reviving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects . Prosecutors believed two officers feared for their lives when they fatally shot Ezell Ford in 2014. \u00a0 'La La Land' danced its way to 14 Oscar nominations.

A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said Mattis would meet with his Korean counterpart in Seoul on Feb. 2 and his Japanese counterpart the following day. The U.S. has thousands of troops based in both countries. \"The trip will underscore the commitment of the United States to our enduring alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea, and further strengthen U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea security cooperation,\" Davis said. At his Senate confirmation hearing and in his first days in office, Mattis, a retired Marine general, has stressed the importance of maintaining international alliances. President Donald Trump raised concerns during the campaign by asserting that some allies are not pulling their weight and by suggesting that he might not object to Japan or South Korea developing their own nuclear weapons if they do not pay more for U.S. military support. 0 Shares ",

The first executive order calls for \u201cthe immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border\u201d -- or in other words, the U.S.-Mexico border wall that was a key promise of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. It also provides additional resources to DHS to stop people intending to \u201cillegally enter the United States without inspection or admission.\u201d Mr. Trump told ABC News earlier Wednesday that construction of the wall will begin \u201cas soon as we can, as soon as we can physically do it.\u201d The second one pertains to the actions and resources of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the branch of the U.S. government that enforces immigration laws. According to the text of the order, it reinstates the Secure Communities Program, which ICE uses to target undocumented immigrants, directs the State Department to withhold visas or take other measures to ensure countries take back the undocumented immigrants the U.S. sends back, and also strips federal grant money from sanctuary cities that harbor undocumented immigrants. The signing of the two executive orders came after the ceremonial swearing-in of Homeland Security John Kelly, who was confirmed by the Senate last Friday. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office. \u201cWe looked at many good people [for the position] but it wasn\u2019t even close,\u201d Mr. Trump said after the swearing-in. \u201cJohn is going to do a tremendous job of protecting our country \u2026 this will be a very, very special job that John\u2019s going to do.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Pentagon Tweet Highlights Marine Who Was Refugee by Tracy Connor advertisement On any other day, the Pentagon's tweet about a Marine who came to the U.S. as an Iraqi refugee wouldn't have raised an eyebrow. But the fact that the Department of Defense decided to highlight the story of Cpl. Ali Mohammed hours after reports that President Trump is expected to ink a temporary ban on most refugees did not go without notice. From refugee to #Marine . @USMC Cpl Ali J. Mohammed takes the fight to the doorstep of those who cast his family out. https://t.co/oSXWGrzsL7 pic.twitter.com/UVlWsaESic \u2014 U.S. Dept of Defense (@DeptofDefense) January 25, 2017 Online observers wondered if someone on the military's social media team was subtweeting the White House by pointing out the contribution a former refugee is making to the U.S. But a Pentagon official told NBC News the tweet's timing was simply a coincidence, that tweets are planned well in advance and that this one had nothing to do with any expected announcements. The tweet directed followers to a feature story on the Marines website, published two days earlier, that recounts how Mohammed's family was driven from Baghdad because of their support for the United States. He joined the Marines in 2014 and is now serving as a translator for a team that supports Iraqi forces in their fight against ISIS. \"America is my home, but Iraq is my homeland,\" Mohammed is quoted as saying. Defense Department spokeswoman Laura Ochoa said the tweet about the profile was simply \"an opportunity to highlight the unique story of one of our U.S. Marines and his service to our country.\" Two days earlier, another Defense Department post about social media posting and mental health was seen by some as a possible dig at the prolific tweeter-in-chief. But that tweet actually linked to a Jan. 19 report about suicide-prevention, a priority issue for the Pentagon.

The Park Service later apologized. An ex-employee of the Badlands National Park then posted a series of messages about climate change that were viewed as a protest against Trump The Badlands National Park's tweets about climate change were later deleted.

A pair of fences separates Mexico, left, and the U.S. south of San Diego. (Bill Wechter / AFP) Kate Linthicum Contact Reporter President\u00a0 Trump \u2019s executive order to immediately start construction of a border wall has widened his rift with\u00a0Mexico and placed pressure on Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to boycott a meeting with Trump planned for next week. On Wednesday,\u00a0Trump directed the\u00a0Department of Homeland Security to begin building a wall along stretches of the southern border\u00a0where a barrier does not already exist. In what political analysts and many Mexicans viewed as a stinging affront, the order came the same day that\u00a0Mexico\u2019s foreign secretary, Luis Videgaray, arrived in Washington for talks with White House officials on\u00a0trade and other issues ahead of Pena Nieto\u2019s planned visit.\u00a0 \u201cIt's a slap in the face that he did this on the very day that Videgaray arrived in the United States to negotiate the terms of the relationship,\u201d said\u00a0Laura Carlsen, the director of the Americas Program at the Center for International Policy. \u201cDonald Trump\u00a0is saying, \u2018I\u00a0will negotiate all of the terms\u00a0because I\u00a0don't care about Mexico.\u2019\u201d That was the message that many Mexicans heard from Trump the presidential candidate, who insulted Mexican immigrants as drug dealers and rapists and repeatedly vowed to keep them out, forcing Mexico to pay for the construction of a border wall. Armando Rios Piter, a senator with Mexico\u2019s leftist opposition Democratic Revolution Party,\u00a0called Trump\u2019s announcement Wednesday \u201ca hostile act.\u201d Rios was one of dozens\u00a0of Mexican politicians and leaders who on Wednesday\u00a0called on Pe\u00f1a Nieto to cancel a meeting with\u00a0Trump that the White House had\u00a0said would take place on Tuesday. Roberto Gil Zuarth, a senator with the opposition National Action Party,\u00a0said support for a boycott of the meeting was broad. \"We will unite all the political forces of this country to send a very clear message to the U.S. government and to President Trump\u00a0 that we will not tolerate being offended, being mistreated and our country's image being damaged,\" he said.

Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump before a news conference in Mexico City in August. (Yuri Cortez / AFP/Getty Images) Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s office never confirmed the meeting after the White House announced it several days ago, and on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0a spokesman for the Mexican president\u00a0said he did not know whether it would take place.\u00a0 Pe\u00f1a Nieto canceled a trip to the Dominican Republic on Wednesday, leading some analysts to speculate that he stayed home to monitor the situation with Trump. As recently as this week, the Mexican leader called for dialogue with Trump, who paid him a visit during the campaign last fall. Those overtures have hurt Pe\u00f1a Nieto domestically, with many Mexicans alleging that he has tried too hard to placate Trump. The Mexican president\u2019s approval ratings now hover at 12%. Polls suggest that Trump is among the few politicians that Mexicans despise more. Jitters over what Trump\u2019s rise means for Mexico\u2019s\u00a0economy have fueled a sharp depreciation of the national currency. The peso has weakened more than 20% in the last year, from about 18 pesos per U.S. dollar in January 2016 to nearly 22\u00a0pesos\u00a0per dollar today. Trump has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade agreement,\u00a0enact a border tax on Mexican imports and\u00a0halt\u00a0remittances sent home by immigrants living in the U.S. ",

    "text": "Jan 25 2017, 1:30 pm ET What Phoenix Can Teach Us About Reclaiming the Night Sky by Michael H. Wilson The stars of the Milky Way. Ray Farmer / NBC News Share advertisement A few thousand stars in the Milky Way galaxy should be visible to the naked eye as you look skyward on any given night. Alas, conditions are rarely ideal in many places, largely because artificial lights on the ground create an ambient glow that illuminates the sky and makes it difficult to see anything but the brightest stars \u2014 and maybe a planet or two. Related: The Hunt For Alien Megastructures is On As major cities adopt newer, more energy-efficient LED streetlights, the problem has only gotten worse. New bulbs may save millions in electricity costs, but the blue glare given off has created a halo of light pollution that has caused fewer and fewer stars to be visible on even the clearest night. It's a growing problem for astronomers, who often end up in far-flung corners of world just to find dark skies, but the intrusion of these bright lights is now taking a toll on everyone. \"We just lost something that I think is part of what once made us human,\" says John Barentine, program manager at the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA). \"Going back into our distance past before there was agriculture and civilization, humanity had this instant connection to what was happening in the sky, day and night.\" A waxing crescent moon is seen behind a streetlight with a newly-installed LED fixture in Las Vegas in 2011. Ethan Miller / Getty Images, file Now, about 80 percent of people in the United States live in places where they can't easily see distant stars or even the white glow of the Milky Way, Barentine explains. High temperature LEDs above 5,500k produce a daylight hue that can cause eye damage and affect our circadian rhythms over time, creating sleep issues that may lead to depression and obesity, according to the American Medical Association. Low Lights, Big City One city might have found a way to maximize the benefits of LED streetlights, while eliminating the affecting glow . Last year, Phoenix's city council voted to replace the bulbs in all 90,000 lamps on streets and in parks with yellow-hued 2700k LEDs , reducing light pollution while offering safer driving conditions and fewer health effects. It's a solution for everyone, but the astronomers might just be the ones with the most to gain. Few places have witnessed the loss of the naturally dark night sky like the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. The iconic building, made famous by dozens of Hollywood movies, is the spot where many in the well-lit city can see stars through a telescope for the first time. Anthony Cook, the astronomical observer at Griffith, has worked there since 1978 and has seen a large change in visibility since his first years on the job. The Griffith Observatory overlooks Los Angeles from atop the Hollywood Hills on Nov. 2, 2006. David McNew / Getty Images, file \"We have a buffer of approximately a mile around us from a lot of bright lights because we're in the park, which has a lot of wilderness around it,\" Cook says. \"Never the less you can see the effects of the city, definitely, so we're kind of a tiny island of relative darkness in a huge sea of urban lighting.\" In recent years, Griffith, which hosts hundreds of children and curious adults each night, has had to focus its telescope on easy-to-see objects, such as planets or the moon's craters, as the glow of the city increases. Cook says he now has to travel as far as Joshua Tree National Park, more than three hours away, to even get a glimpse of celestial bodies that are more difficult to spot. A Natural Resource National parks are among the few places in the U.S. where dark skies are intentionally preserved. While Joshua Tree is still affected by the glow of L.A., places like Big Bend National Park in southern Texas have little or no artificial light pollution. The National Parks Service (NPS) is leading the way on data collection of dark skies and light pollution, and even created a special division that researchers and monitors these concerns, aptly named the Natural Sounds and Night Sky Division. \"A lot of people never thought of the night sky as a resource, like the lakes, forest, and wildlife,\" says Bob Meadows, a physical scientist for the division. \"But unlike other natural resources the night sky is a completely recoverable resource by simply turning off our lights.\" The Milky Way illuminates the sky behind the famous landmark of Delicate Arch in Arches National Park in Utah on April 5, 2016. Alex Milan Tracy / Sipa USA The solution may sound simple enough, but getting millions of people to turn off unnecessary lights is anything but easy. As a small organization that partners with the NPS and grassroots movements across the world, the IDA helps people find ways to combat light pollution, whether they want safer lighting for themselves or the environment, or they want to see the Milky Way a little clearer. Reclaiming the Night Sky The victory in Phoenix has become a rallying cry for astronomy buffs and those looking to protect the environment and dark skies alike. Kelly Beatty, secretary of the IDA's board and contributing editor at Sky & Telescope magazine, says the successful vote was a major step forward, and his hope is that other large cities with take notice. \"My sense is that it has taken decades for the lighting to get this bad, so consequently it will probably take decades to make it better,\" Beatty says. \"But the revolution in lighting that these LEDs represent gives us a chance. They give us a chance to look at the problem anew.\" Related: Geoengineering Could Pose Big Problem for Astronomers Despite recent efforts, light pollution will continue to glow as cities sprawl across the landscape. But many who have never lived with a clear view of the night sky hope to one day reestablish our age-old connection with distant stars and planets. According to noted astronomy author Bob Berman, it might just be a matter of changing priorities. \"No one is saying that cities shouldn't be well lit,\" Berman says. \"Everything has its time and place, and the same is true of light and darkness. And there is a place for darkness, and, I think that is slowly being realized.\" Michael H. Wilson ",

Rick Snyder, who faced intense national criticism over the water crisis, in a statement. While the governor touted the decreased lead levels as a big step forward, activists and community members aren't breathing easy yet. Gov. Rick Snyder speaks to the press on April 20, 2016 in Lansing, Michigan, about charges filed stemming from an investigation into the Flint lead water crisis by the office of the attorney general. Julia Nagy / Lansing State Journal via AP \"Numbers always fluctuate and the department only tested one percent of homes in one period of time in Flint,\" said Melissa Mays, a community advocate with Flint Rising, a grassroots group that is aggressively tackling the water disaster. \"These reports are premature and it gives residents and everyone else a false sense of security that things are getting better when they are not,\" she said.

According to Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, there are still 20,000 lead tainted pipes that need to be replaced. Although Weaver said she found the test results \"encouraging,\" the mayor reminded residents that \"we are not out of the woods yet.\" She said she hopes to replace 6,000 pipes by the end of the year with the \"help of state and federal government.\" Flint, Michigan Mayor Karen Weaver testifies before the House Democratic Steering &amp; Policy Committee at a hearing titled, \"The Flint Water Crisis: Lessons for Protecting America's Children\" at the Capitol on Feb. 10, 2016 in Washington, D.C. House Democrats hold a hearing on the toxic lead water crisis in Flint, MI. Gabriella Demczuk / Getty Images, file Residents are still being told not to drink the water and to continue using filtered water. \"If it's been years and I still can't drink or use the water, then what progress is that?\" said Tonya Blooming, a Flint resident and mother of three young children. \"Lead numbers change week to week, and I have a feeling there will be another report later on that will negate this one. It's happened to me before.\" Read More: Four More Officials Charged Over Flint, Michigan, Water Crisis Flint's water crisis began three years ago. The city has dealt with a host of other issues on top of the tainted water. Residents last year faced an outbreak of Legionnaire disease, leading to several deaths, as well as a rash of shigellosis , a bacterial illness frequently associated with poor hand washing hygiene. Four officials were charged last month in connection with water crisis. Two former Michigan state emergency managers, Darnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose, face multiple felony charges for failing to protect Flint citizens from health hazards caused by the contaminated drinking water. Former Flint city executives Howard Croft and Daugherty Johnson also face felony charges. \"Reports like this butter people up so it looks like things are all great, but is really just laying the groundwork to exit without actually doing anything,\" said lifelong Flint resident Donald Harbin.

But Trump's comments contradict what his own lawyers argued in December, while objecting to Green Party candidate Jill Stein's Midwestern recount efforts. At the time, his legal team said in filings objecting to Stein's recount efforts that there was no evidence of voter fraud in the presidential election. \"All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,\" Trump's legal team said in their objection to the Michigan recount. When asked about that statement, Spicer said Wednesday that there may be states where that was \"not necessarily the case.\" \"I think there's a lot of states were we didn't compete in where that's not necessarily the case,\" he said at the White House press briefing, citing California and New York as possible examples. \"We didn't look at those two states in particular,\" he said. \"I think when you look at where a lot of these issues could have occurred in bigger states, that's where I think we're going to look but I'm think there will be more on that as the week goes on and we'll be able to examine that further,\" he said. Heather Gerken, a professor of law at Yale University and expert on election law, told NBC News it was \"completely natural\" to have people on voter rolls in two states or for some people to remain on the voter rolls after they have died and stressed this did not equate to actual fraudulent voting. \"To equate that with voter fraud is irresponsible,\" she said. \"They're completely different issues.\" Gerken added that people moving to a different state or grieving loved ones not thinking to call election officials were often the cause of such voter registration issues. Trump's own chief strategist, Steve Bannon, was registered to vote in both Florida and New York City until Wednesday, local election officials told NBC News. Bannon was removed from the voting rolls in Sarasota County, Florida, on Wednesday per notification from the New York City Board of Elections, an official with the Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections said. Trump's youngest daughter, Tiffany, is currently registered in both New York City and Philadelphia, according to state election records in New York and Pennsylvania. Trump was studying in Philadelphia, where she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania last May. The finding was first reported by Heat Street. Gerken said that there was no evidence at all to support claims of mass voting fraud in last year's election \u2014 and the kind of voter fraud Trump claims would require highly coordinated nationwide efforts. \"You would have to imagine a massive conspiracy crossing many states to steal a federal election,\" she said. Michael Waldman, president of the non-partisan policy institute The Brennan Center for Justice, said in statement Wednesday morning that \"There is no evidence of massive voter fraud \u2014 none.\" \"The notion that millions of people voted illegally two months ago, and nobody noticed, is preposterous on its face,\" he said in the statement. On Wednesday morning, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted responded to Trump, tweeting that his state conducted a review four year's ago and was already conducting a state-wide review of the 2016 election. \"Easy to vote, hard to cheat,\" Husted said in the tweet. Trump's comments have been criticized by officials on both sides of the aisle, with GOP Senator Lindsey Graham pleading with Trump to stop repeating the claim. \"To continue to suggest that the 2016 election was conducted in a fashion that millions of people voted illegally undermines faith in our democracy,\" Graham said. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Wednesday that there was \"no evidence\" to back up Trump's claims. \"I think that those who allege that have to come up with some substantiation of the claim,\" he added. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., told MSNBC that the Oversight the House's Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was sending a letter on Wednesday to 50 attorney generals all over the county \"who have basically said that there is no real voter fraud.\" \"The thing that I worry about with this argument about voter fraud is it gives the Republicans and others another tool and another reason to justify to the public of denying people the right to vote,\" he said. The National Association of Secretaries of State, which includes many Republicans, also took issue with Trump's claim. \"We are not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by President Trump, but we are open to learning more about the Administration's concerns,\" the group said in a statement released yesterday. \"In the lead up to the November 2016 election, secretaries of state expressed their confidence in the systemic integrity of our election process as a bipartisan group, and they stand behind that statement today.\" Daniella Silva ",

Got it President Trump joins hands with his homeland security secretary, retired Gen. John F. Kelly, during remarks at Department of Homeland Security headquarters on Jan. 25. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) By Abby Phillip and Ashley Parker By Abby Phillip and Ashley Parker January 25 at 7:06 PM Follow @abbydphillip Follow @ashleyrparker During the campaign, many of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters and even his advisers said they took many of the candidate\u2019s most far-reaching promises seriously but not literally. Now in his first week at the White House, President Trump is showing that at least some of them were indeed meant literally \u2014 putting him at odds not only with critics but with some members of his own party. The Trump administration is showing every sign of taking the nation far to the right in an effort to make good on a number of his pledges, including barring refugees and immigrants from some Muslim-majority countries, potentially implementing an ideological test for others, working to build a wall on the border with Mexico and even exploring the possibility of reopening a caustic debate over \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d such as waterboarding. \u201cHe\u2019s never taken a position that he doesn\u2019t agree with. He\u2019s never taken a position that he doesn\u2019t believe in,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump adviser. \u201cThe idea that he wasn\u2019t going to be a results-oriented president on the platform he ran on, that he designed, was a complete misnomer.\u201d The White House said that no one should be surprised that Trump is trying to follow through on his campaign promises, starting with bold, if controversial, executive actions. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents wait for the arrival of President Trump at the Department of Homeland Security on Jan. 25. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) \u201cThe biggest thing is the president is somebody who likes to get things done,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the principal deputy White House press secretary. \u201cHe\u2019s very much an executive. He\u2019s a builder. He likes to map out a plan and see it all come to fruition. He mapped out a plan to win the presidency, he won, and now he\u2019s implementing the policies he campaigned on. He\u2019s not somebody who sits back and waits for things to happen.\u201d With an executive action Wednesday, Trump signaled he would start with one of the biggest: the process of constructing the wall with Mexico. At the same time, in attempting to fulfill that promise, Trump is illustrating the limits of his approach. His vow to make Mexico pay for the wall remains unfulfilled, and he has not detailed any new plans to accomplish it. \u201cWe do not need new laws,\u201d Trump said Wednesday, a tacit acknowledgment that Congress had not yet signed on to the proposal. \u201cWe will work within the existing system and framework.\u201d Some congressional Republicans, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have already reacted with alarm at reports that Trump could seek to reopen CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d and revisit banned \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d that he advocated during the campaign. The position would also put Trump at odds with his defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis, who Trump said last year had lobbied him strenuously in opposition to the interrogation practices. But Trump appears to be determined to press the issue, telling ABC News in an interview that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d believes that waterboarding works. Some of his initial executive actions have been more symbol than substance. An executive order aimed at muzzling regulations associated with the Affordable Care Act signed by Trump on Inauguration Day is all but moot until Trump\u2019s Cabinet secretaries are confirmed by the Senate and in their jobs. And his announcement Monday of a withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership was simply the final and expected end for the 12-nation trade deal, which had languished in Congress. Trump also promised Wednesday to stop \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that decline to help enforce federal immigration laws, but his executive order simply instructs his homeland security secretary to withhold some federal grants from such jurisdictions. The Trump administration made a show of putting the measures into place, with signing ceremonies staged in the Oval Office and Trump\u2019s visit to the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday. Trump also moved quickly on other items that have long been on the Republican Party\u2019s wish list, beginning with authorizing federal agencies to ease the regulatory burden of the Affordable Care Act, banning federal funds for nongovernmental organizations that provide or counsel women on abortions, and reauthorizing construction on two controversial oil pipelines. \u201cHe is the new action hero for America,\u201d said Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), who declared himself \u201cvery pleased\u201d about Trump\u2019s first five days. Kelly said he was particularly happy about Trump\u2018s efforts to clear the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. \u201cPeople kind of sit back and say, \u2018I can\u2019t believe he did it that quickly.\u2019 And other people say, \u2018I can\u2019t believe it took that long.\u2019 How many more studies do we have to do?\u201d But some Republicans said that while Trump is making good on his broad campaign promises, he has undermined his success through his inability to focus on a core message, instead allowing himself to succumb to petty distractions. This week, Trump hosted jobs-focused meetings with auto and other business executives and union leaders and arranged for the groups to hold news conferences outside the West Wing to debrief the media, an opportunity to amplify a message about job creation. But news has been dominated by Trump\u2019s fixation with the crowd size at his inauguration, his press secretary\u2019s airing of grievances against the media and Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated insistence to congressional leaders that millions of illegal votes had been cast in November, costing him the popular vote. \u201cI thought a lot of what\u2019s happened has actually been good \u2014 the meetings with automobile makers, unions and everything else,\u201d said Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.). \u201cWhen you argue over crowd size, when you argue over, you know, voter fraud, things like that, you\u2019re taking your eye off the message and, I think, harming your ability to unify Republicans in the country.\u201d Trump\u2019s moves have alarmed Democrats, some of whom were cautiously optimistic that they could work with Trump as a self-proclaimed non-ideological dealmaker but who now see him fulfilling their worst fears. \u201cDuring the campaign, the president ran against both the Democratic and Republican establishments,\u201d said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cBut since he was elected he has governed entirely from the hard right, totally ignoring all of the promises he made to working people during the campaign.\u201d Trump\u2019s week of executive orders, codifying his most contentious campaign positions, has also signaled to Democrats that he does not intend to moderate on much as president. \u201cI\u2019m particularly concerned with his penchant for pronouncements, his being challenged on those pronouncement and his doubling down and tripling down on them,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cI had very low expectations for what a Trump presidency would be, but he\u2019s proven far worse than I expected.\u201d Mike DeBonis and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Elizabeth Keatinge (@ekeatinge) has more. Buzz60 In this Jan. 19 photo, police stand guard outside the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. \u00a0(Photo: John Minchillo, AP) Electricians who rushed work on President Donald Trump\u2019s newly opened hotel in Washington\u00a0say they are owed more than $2 million, and the contractor has\u00a0filed a lawsuit to force payment . Freestate Electrical filed the suit in D.C. Superior Court alleging Trump\u2019s company asked for a rush order on the hotel before it\u2019s soft opening in September and the grand opening shortly before Election Day to complete fire alarm and electrical work.\u00a0Trump's company\u00a0paid $15 million on the contract, but withheld payment on the final installment, the lawsuit says. \u201cAcceleration of Freestate\u2019s work required Freestate\u2019s crews to work nonstop, seven days per week, 10 to 14 hours per day, for nearly 50 consecutive days,\u201d the lawsuit says, adding the extra work was at the Trump company's direction so that it could\u00a0open before the election and get\u00a0positive press coverage. The lawsuit alleges Trump\u2019s company\u00a0agreed to pay one third of the remaining bill, which the electricians deem\u00a0\u201cunreasonable.\u201d The electrical company formerly filed a lien on the hotel\u00a0for unpaid work. \u201cTrump\u2019s actions in refusing to pay for work performed, after a project has opened, is a repeated practice of the Trump Organization on various projects; evidencing a typical business practice meant to force subcontractors to accept \u2018pennies on the dollar...\u201d the lawsuit alleges. Attorneys for the electricians also took time in the filing to point out the confusion over Trump\u2019s continued lease with the General Services Administration. That 2014 lease, attached as an exhibit to the suit and signed by Trump, says \u201cno elected official of the Government of the United States\u2026 shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\u201d\u00a0Attorneys for the Trump Organization did not immediately return a request for comment.

On the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration , the National Parks Service -- a bureau of the United States Department of Interior -- retweeted a politically-charged photo comparing the crowd sizes at President Trump and former President Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration in Washington, D.C. The Department of Interior was asked to temporarily suspend any social media actions following the tweet, but their twitter account resumed activity the day after inauguration. The removal of the Badlands tweets drew condemnation online and from Democratic National Committee. \u201c Vladimir Putin would be proud,\u201d wrote Adrienne Watson \u201cin response to the deletion of the Badlands National Park Service tweets about climate change in defiance of President Trump\u2019s gag order.\u201d While Trump\u2019s pick to head the Department of Interior, Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, said that he does not think climate change is a hoax, the topic has been a hot button during Trump cabinet confirmation hearings as President Trump has previously stated \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d However in an interview with the New York Times, Trump said he now has an open mind to climate change and human connections to rising temperatures. \"I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much,\" said Trump. \"It\u2019s one issue that\u2019s interesting because there are few things where there\u2019s more division than climate change.\" The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the freeze on agency social media accounts during his press briefing on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that when there\u2019s an administration turnover, that we\u2019re going to review the policies,\u201d said Spicer about reports that the Environmental Protection Agency was barred from public communications. Spicer said the Department of Interior seemed to break with social media policies. \u201cMy understanding is that because they had inappropriately violated their own social media policies, there was guidance that was put out to the department to act in compliance with the rules that were set forth,\u201d said Spicer. The Badlands National Park could not be reached for comment. 0 Shares ",

Markeith Loyd uttered the expletive after the judge set a bond of $500 for the charge of resisting arrest without violence during a Wednesday morning hearing.

    "text": "Here's a quick primer on Trump's wall \u2014 how long it would have to be, how much it will cost and what Americans think about it. The situation right now Trump is no stranger to flip-flopping, and he has voiced different opinions on how he wants the border barrier to look. When CBS's Lesley Stahl asked him if he would \"accept a fence,\" he answered, \"For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate.\" Then at his Jan. 11 press conference , he took a harder line: \"On the fence, it's not a fence; it's the wall,\" he told reporters. \"You just misreported it. We're going to build a wall.\" Remember, for the record, he said \u2014 \"For certain areas I would.\" Should he decide to accept some fencing, he has existing fencing to add onto: As of late 2015 , there were 652.7 miles of border fence along the roughly 2,000-mile-long border. Along with that head start on the barrier, he also appears to have a head start on the legislative side. When Republican Rep. Luke Messer recently claimed that the fence is authorized, and that it only needs to be funded, PolitiFact ruled it \"True.\" A November 2016 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service bolsters that finding: Article continues after sponsorship Democrats Try To Find A Future Post-Obama With Fault Lines Along Economics, Race \"DHS's current policy not to deploy a substantial amount of additional fencing, beyond what is expressly required by law, appears primarily premised on policy considerations and funding constraints, rather than significant legal impediments,\" writes the author (whose name was redacted from the report). Still, there are other logistical hurdles. For example, there's the pesky issue of private land ownership. When the U.S. government was building the fence from 2008 to 2010, the Border Patrol \"had to enter into negotiations or begin condemnation proceedings with landowners,\" as NPR's John Burnett reported in mid-2014 . And even then, years after the construction, some lawsuits were still ongoing. Another potential legal barrier exists in a 47-year-old treaty, as the AP reported on Wednesday: \"The Trump administration also must adhere to a decades-old border treaty with Mexico that limits where and how structures can be built along the border. The 1970 treaty requires that structures cannot disrupt the flow of the rivers, which define the U.S.-Mexico border along Texas and 24 miles in Arizona, according to The International Boundary and Water Commission, a joint U.S.-Mexican agency that administers the treaty.\" The cost: high. An actual wall could cost $15 billion to $40 billion A member of President Trump's own party criticized the cost of a wall on Wednesday. Texas Republican Rep. William Hurd, who represents a district featuring a lengthy border with Mexico, said in a statement, \"The facts have not changed. Building a wall is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border.\" Here are some basic facts on cost: Trump will need to find funding, and he very well may need a lot of it. While Trump at one point estimated the cost of his wall (or wall-fence combination) to be $8 billion \u2014 which he later revised to $10 billion to $12 billion \u2014 it could easily be much higher. Were he to, in fact, try a wall, the cost could be much higher. One estimate from MIT found that a 1,000-mile wall would cost anywhere between $27 billion and $40 billion. Another estimate from research and investment firm Bernstein put it at $15 billion to $25 billion. Of course, a fence could be far cheaper than a wall. The nearly 653 miles of wall built thus far cost around $2.3 billion, the DHS said in 2015 congressional testimony. That comes out to around $3.5 million per mile. Trump's U.S.-Mexico Wall Is Among Key Immigration Actions Wednesday Multiply that out across 1,300 more miles, and it comes to around $4.6 billion. But there's a big caveat here: That could easily be a very conservative estimate. Estimating how much a border fence costs isn't simply a matter of miles times dollars, because some miles of border fence cost far more than others. A 2009 analysis from the Government Accountability Office found that as of late 2008, pedestrian fencing had cost the government an average $3.9 million per mile \u2014 but that costs ranged from $400,000 to $15.1 million per mile. Likewise, vehicle fencing averaged $1 million per mile but ranged from $200,000 to $1.8 million per mile. And costs vary depending on who's doing the estimation. One 2009 analysis from the Department of Homeland Security estimated that as of late 2008, it would cost $6.5 million per mile for pedestrian fencing \u2014 that is, fencing primarily meant to block people attempting to cross the border on foot. Vehicle fencing came out to $1.7 million per mile. Prices can vary for a number of reasons; for example, the fence is far taller in some places than others, and different materials are used in different spots. Geography also plays a part in determining cost. Along some stretches of the border, like rough mountain ranges, costs could exceed $10 million per mile , as Burnett has reported. The cost also depends upon who is doing the building. Commercial builders are more expensive than if the U.S. depends upon the military to build the fence. And then other costs could easily arise \u2014 for example, the cost of legal proceedings from all those dealings with landowners mentioned above. Cost considerations are less of a worry if Mexico will pay for the wall, as Trump has claimed it would. But he is unlikely to be able to make that happen without a massive fight, as Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto seemed to indicate earlier this month. \"It is evident that we have differences with the new United States government on some issues, such as a wall that Mexico absolutely will not pay for,\" Pe\u00f1a Nieto said, as quoted by the Guardian . \"At no time will we accept anything that goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans.\" Most Americans are opposed to the wall Many Trump supporters were fervent supporters of a border wall (as evidenced by the loud chants of \"Build the wall\" at his campaign events). However, polls suggest that Americans as a whole aren't thrilled about a border wall. A recent ABC News poll found that only 37 percent of Americans are in favor of building it. It's not that Americans aren't concerned about immigration, of course; 72 percent of Americans want to \"deport undocumented criminals,\" according to the ABC News poll. Likewise, a Pew Research Center poll from late November and early December found that large majorities of Americans support a variety of immigration policies: 77 percent said it's \"somewhat\" or \"very important\" to have stricter enforcement of visa overstays, and 73 percent said the same of preventing unqualified immigrants from receiving government benefits, for example. Meanwhile, only 39 percent said the same of building a border wall. Indeed, majorities supported other policies that run counter to the Trump immigration agenda, including allowing people who entered the country as children to stay, as well as supporting a path to legal status.

Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson visits the Chicago Fire Academy Crisis Intervention Simulator Lab on Jan. 16, 2017. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Jeremy Gorner , Jason Meisner and Annie Sweeney Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune The roots of Chicago's gun violence epidemic are so deep and multifaceted that experts have long said law enforcement alone can't solve it. But in 24 characters of a tweet sent Tuesday night, President Donald Trump proposed his solution if Chicago can't reduce the violence. \"I will send in the Feds!\" Trump, who campaigned on a law-and-order platform, tweeted Tuesday night in a post that also quoted data on Chicago shootings published by the Tribune this week. What exactly the president meant by the vague missive was a matter of open debate for hours  Wednesday as law enforcement agencies scrambled to read between the lines and decide how \u2014 or even if \u2014 to respond. Was Trump talking about delivering more federal aid to the Chicago Police Department ? Would he send more resources to the FBI or other federal agencies that  already have been working on the problem for years? Or did he intend to send in the National Guard? \"The statement is so broad. I have no idea what he's talking about,\" Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. At the White House daily briefing Wednesday afternoon, press secretary Sean Spicer sought to clarify Trump's remark, telling reporters that the president was upset about \"turning on the television and seeing Americans get killed by shootings.\" But Spicer gave no indication the president was close to ordering in troops. \"What he wants to do is provide the resources of the federal government, and it can span a bunch of things,\" Spicer said. \"There's no one thing. There can be aid, if it was requested up through the governor, through the proper channels, that the federal government can provide on a law enforcement basis.\" Spicer: Rahm has not returned Trump's call White House spokesperson said in press briefing Jan. 25, 2017, he believed\u00a0Rahm Emaunel has not yet returned President Trump's phone call. (White House) White House spokesperson said in press briefing Jan. 25, 2017, he believed\u00a0Rahm Emaunel has not yet returned President Trump's phone call. (White House) See more videos The Tuesday tweet was not the first time Trump had used his favorite social media platform to jab at Chicago's homicide rate or imply that Mayor Rahm Emanuel needed help. But it was the president's first direct comment on the issue since a stinging report from the U.S. Department of Justice released Jan. 13 that found Chicago police routinely used excessive force and violated the civil rights of citizens, particularly in the mostly minority communities that are hardest hit by violence. In fact, the report specifically said that overly harsh policing tactics did more harm than good, making residents feel like the police were an \"occupying force.\" Jonathan Smith, former head of special litigation for the Justice Department, told the Tribune on Wednesday that in Chicago and other cities, federal help to combat gun violence has come in the form of a \"surge\" of federal agents to work on task forces with local police. But those are short-term solutions at best, he said, and bringing in the National Guard would be even more unsustainable. \"To solve a public safety problem, troops are not the answer,\" Smith said. \"Is (Trump) going to put National Guard troops on every corner for the next two years? It's a long-term problem that needs long-term solutions.\" Trump's tweet came just four days after he took the oath of office and referred back to a line from his inaugural address Friday citing the \"American carnage\" left behind by crime, gangs and drugs. Last year, Chicago experienced its worst violence in two decades \u2014 with more than 4,300 people shot and  762 killed, according to official Police Department statistics. And the violence has continued at comparable levels so far in January. The issue was being debated in a Fox News segment Tuesday night that cited numbers from a Tribune analysis of homicides and shootings. Less than an hour later, Trump tweeted: \"If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\" Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday welcomed federal assistance to help stem Chicago violence but rejected the idea of the National Guard patrolling the city as \"antithetical\" to the trust he's trying to build in law enforcement. The mayor's comments came after President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening... Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday welcomed federal assistance to help stem Chicago violence but rejected the idea of the National Guard patrolling the city as \"antithetical\" to the trust he's trying to build in law enforcement. The mayor's comments came after President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening... (John Byrne and Hal Dardick) The chain reaction Trump's words set off illustrated how even from the Oval Office he has continued to use social media to set his agenda, regardless of the complexity or sensitivity of the subject matter. It seemed to catch police brass in Chicago off-guard. In an exclusive telephone interview with the Tribune on Wednesday morning, Johnson said he was baffled by the meaning of the president's words. If it meant a mobilization of National Guard troops, Johnson said he would be opposed. \"They're not trained for this type of action,\" he said, noting in addition that federal troops may not have the power to make arrests. Johnson said he does not oppose increased assistance from the federal government \u2014 whether that would mean more agents from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or more help geared toward youth living in Chicago's most violent neighborhoods. \"We would use (federal funding for) mentorship programs, after-school programs,\" he said. \"Those are the things I think we can use.\" Trump's tweet also prompted phones to light up Wednesday at the Chicago FBI office and the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago, where national reporters were calling seeking reaction. In response, the Chicago FBI put out a general statement saying the agency \"works closely\" with state, local and federal partners \"to combat violent crime.\" The U.S. attorney's office had no comment. The tweet was also being talked about Wednesday in some of Chicago's hardest-hit communities. The Rev. Marshall Hatch, who heads New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park, said he'd welcome any kind of help kick-starting economic recovery. But adding more military-style policing to a neighborhood where Chicago police are  already seen as aggressive and disconnected from residents would be a recipe for disaster, he said. President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday night about Chicago\u2019s violence, saying he will \u201csend in the Feds!\u201d if the city \u201cdoesn\u2019t fix the horrible \u2018carnage\u2019 going on.\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet refers back to a line in his inaugural address Friday about \u201cthe crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen... President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday night about Chicago\u2019s violence, saying he will \u201csend in the Feds!\u201d if the city \u201cdoesn\u2019t fix the horrible \u2018carnage\u2019 going on.\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet refers back to a line in his inaugural address Friday about \u201cthe crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen... (Liam Ford) \"We don't want martial  law,\" Hatch said. \"If the president means more resources to deal with some of the socio-economic issues, if the president means more resources with the plan to hire more police that could be part of the community, then that is the kind of help that could make sense. But not sending in the National Guard.\" Although it's difficult to pull context out of a 140-character tweet, Trump's words, to some, belied the fact that \"the Feds\" have been deeply involved in the gun violence issue for years. Agencies like the FBI, ATF and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration devote significant resources to going after gun offenders, often partnering with Chicago police in task forces designed to get the most violent criminals off the streets. In recent years, federal prosecutors have stepped up collaborative efforts with the Cook County state's attorney's office to determine where certain gun cases should be brought to maximize potential sentences. But many experts warned that while smart and aggressive policing can help stem the tide for a time, in the end it's a complex social justice problem entrenched in neighborhoods where joblessness and hopelessness have existed for generations. Since taking over as Chicago's top federal prosecutor in 2013, U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon has repeatedly tempered expectations about how much of a dent federal authorities can make with limited resources. \"We're not going to arrest our way out of the gang problem that we have in the city of Chicago,\" Fardon said. Meanwhile, a report released this week that surveyed police chiefs across the country found that a \"surge\" of federal agents is low on the list of help they want to address violent crime. In the report, released by the Police Foundation and Major Cities Chiefs Association, \"short-term surges of federal law enforcement staffing\" was ranked second-to-last in a list of 17 ways the federal government could help local cops fight gun violence. Instead, the chiefs were looking for more tools \u2014 like ballistics imaging and gun tracing \u2014 to fight crime, the report said. The report also noted that budgets and salaries for the agencies charged with fighting crime \u2014 including the  DEA and ATF \u2014 have \"only grown modestly\" since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, while Immigration and Customs Enforcement resources have grown considerably. Though the White House seemed to tamp down any immediate plan to put boots on the ground in Chicago, it wouldn't be the first time that calling up the National Guard has been discussed in the face of the city's persistent gun violence. In 2008, Gov. Rod Blagojevich said violent crime was \"out of control\" and \"reaching epidemic proportions\" in certain neighborhoods while suggesting the National Guard and Illinois State Police could help. Two years later, when the city's homicide rate rose slightly over the previous year, two Democratic state legislators suggested Gov. Pat Quinn dispatch the National Guard to Chicago, even though the number of shootings was actually down from earlier in the decade. Quinn downplayed the idea, saying it could be counterproductive to police efforts and that local law enforcement was trained differently than military personnel. Then-Mayor Richard M. Daley also shot down the suggestion as too simplistic. More recently, in the wake of the brutal 2015 killing of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee, an online petition to call up the National Guard was circulated on the grass-roots website change.org that garnered thousands of signatures. The issue was again in the news last August, the city's deadliest month in 23 years. South Side Rev. Michael Pfleger called for Gov. Bruce Rauner to declare a state of emergency due to the violence. But when a reporter suggested to Rauner that residents were in favor of troops being deployed, the governor ruled out the idea, saying that doing so would be an \"emotional\" reaction that \"wouldn't make sense.\" There's also a question of how such a deployment would take shape. Although the National Guard is deployed during natural disasters or in the event of civil unrest, it's typically at the invitation of local officials. If  Trump were to deploy troops to address Chicago's gun violence, it would be \"highly unusual and almost surely unconstitutional,\" said Ronald Allen, a law professor at Northwestern University. jmeisner@chicagotribune.com ",

AES Electrical filed its lawsuit in the District of Columbia Superior Court, the latest in a string of lawsuits \u00a0involving Trump\u2019s renovation of the historic Old Post Office building a few blocks from the White House.\u00a0 The day Donald Trump takes office, he will be in breach of contract on his new Washington, D.C. hotel unless he cuts all financial ties to it. Tr... AES, a California company doing business locally under the name Freestate Electrical Construction Co., alleged that it bore increased expenses last year because of change orders and other demands from Trump\u2019s staff. AES said it was told to accelerate the pace of work so that the then-Republican presidential candidate could hold a televised media event to celebrate the \u201csoft opening\u201d of the luxury hotel prior to the November election. A statement issued by the Trump Organization said that such business disputes are not uncommon during the close-out phase of construction projects of the scale and complexity of the project. \u201cThe Trump Organization has invested over $200 million dollars into the redevelopment of the historic Old Post Office and is incredibly proud of what is now considered to be one the most iconic hotels anywhere in the country,\u201d the statement said. AES said its workers were required to work overtime hours for 50 consecutive days to finish the electrical and fire alarm work at the building before the campaign event. Without the extra work, the company said the building would not have met fire codes and would not have been permitted to open.\u00a0 See who President Donald Trump wants in his inner circle at the White House Trump\u2019s campaign orchestrated a lavish ribbon-cutting event at the hotel, which the candidate used to laud his own business acumen . Trump claimed the hotel was opening earlier than scheduled and under budget. The lawsuit alleged that Trump has saved money by refusing to pay his bills, instead offering to pay AES about one-third of the invoiced amount. \u201cTrump\u2019s actions in refusing to pay for work performed, after a project has opened, is a repeated practice of the Trump organizations on various projects; evidencing a typical business practice meant to force subcontractors to accept \u2018pennies on the dollar\u2019 with respect to amounts owed for the cost of work performed,\u201d the lawsuit alleged. The complaint, filed last week, was first reported by Politico on Wednesday. AES is also suing two of Trump\u2019s primary construction contractors. Trump\u2019s long history of refusing to pay vendors and contractors was the subject of numerous news stories last year. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton sought to make it a campaign issue, including airing a television commercial that featured an architect who said his small business was nearly bankrupted when Trump refused to pay him for designing a club house at one of his golf courses. Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington served as a hub of inaugural activities and has proved controversial for what top Democrats and some ethics advisers see as the new president\u2019s conflicts of interest. Trump\u2019s lease with the federal government to develop and operate the hotel expressly prohibits any elected official from benefiting from the property . So far, Trump has not divested from the project. The government\u2019s General Services Administration has declined to comment on the apparent contract violation that occurred when Trump took office last week. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

A draft order, posted by the Washington Post and confirmed by NBC News, calls for the government to study whether the CIA can resume detaining suspects at so-called \"black sites,\" a program initiated by George W. Bush that Obama banned when he took office. Black sites are secret overseas detention facilities where suspects are interrogated. The draft also calls for a review of interrogation techniques laid out in the U.S. Army Field Manual, which prohibits torture and is currently the standard by which American interrogators must operate, the officials said. The review would examine whether tougher techniques could be effective.

The draft order would also revoke Obama's order closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, which is still open. And it would repeal Obama's order to give the International Red Cross access to all prisoners in American custody as required by the Geneva Conventions, the officials added. The draft raises questions about how far the Trump administration is willing to go in seeking to fulfill Trump's repeated promises during the campaign to reinstate the program of torture that George W. Bush implemented after the 9/11 attacks. Trump famously said a year ago that \"torture works,\" but expressed surprise after his election that his secretary of defense, James Mattis, was vehemently against it. Other Trump cabinet officials, including Attorney General designate Jeff Sessions, told lawmakers that water boarding is illegal.

The source also points out that the draft executive order has not been discussed in the interagency process nor has it been seen by the principals. Congressional sources say Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo told lawmakers they were not involved in the draft and was not aware of its existence. Even if Trump signed the order, and even if subsequent studies recommended the resumption of brutal interrogation techniques, such techniques are currently barred by law, as the draft itself points out, according to a copy posted on the web site of the Washington Post. It would require an Act of Congress to change that, as Pompeo acknowledged during his confirmation hearing. When asked whether he would obey an order from the president to resume water boarding, he said he wouldn't. National Security Adviser Mike Flynn has also voiced opposition to using torture. \"If there's an American strategic advantage, it is our values. We must protect our values at all costs,\" Flynn said in December 2014, endorsing the conclusions of the Senate report that was highly critical of the CIA's use of torture. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who survived torture as a prisoner in Vietnam, said on MSNBC's Morning Joe Wednesday that \"even though the Army Field Manual can be reviewed, it still does not allow to return to the use of torture, including waterboarding.\" Critics have pointed out that Pompeo's answers to written questions by senators as part of his confirmation process left open the door to studying more aggressive interrogation techniques. \"I will consult with the experts at the Agency and at other organizations in the U.S. government on whether the Army Field Manual uniform application is an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country or whether any rewrite of the Army Field Manual is needed,\" Pompeo wrote . \"If any such differences are justified, a fundamental requirement is that such differences fully comply with law, including laws governing the treatment and interrogation of individuals.\" Pompeo assured Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who led the investigation that produced the Senate torture report, that he would consult with \"career intelligence professionals,\" about any possible changes. Feinstein voted to confirm him. Torture aside, it is also extremely unlikely, U.S. officials say, that the CIA would resume its own program of detaining prisoners abroad. Many CIA officers feel burned by what happened the last time they went down this road \u2014 many incurred legal bills and years of investigations. Moreover, other countries would have to agree to host such sites, knowing that the sites became public the last time this was tried. John Yoo worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel from 2001-2003, where he crafted the legal justifications for CIA interrogation methods, including waterboarding. Susan Walsh / AP Also, the same law that bans torture also requires that the Red Cross be given access to prisoners in U.S. custody, so it would in theory be illegal for the CIA to secretly detain people for any significant length of time. According to U.S. military sources directly involved in intelligence policy, the U.S. military and multi-agency interrogation teams currently have access to terror detainees in a number of facilities around the world, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and Jordan. The Obama Administration also created an interagency High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG) under the FBI that has studied effectiveness, training, and techniques for the debriefing of detainees. The Army meanwhile has trained more than 3,000 interrogators in the past eight years and has created an Interrogation and Debriefing Training Facility in Texas. The creation of an interrogation apparatus within the bounds of the law and under military regulation, the sources tell NBC News, has not only increased professionalism but also eliminated the likelihood that some future incident like 9/11 will catch the national security establishment \"flat-footed.\" The CIA, the sources say, is involved in interrogations still, but is no longer a lead agency. \"I'm unaware of any voices within the Agency arguing for the changes Mr. Trump is considering,\" the senior intelligence official told NBC News.

    "text": "CBS News Jan 25, 2017 10:38 AM EST The Secret Service is investigating comments by a senior agent who suggested she would not take a bullet for President Trump. The Secret Service led security efforts around the inauguration and is tasked with protected elected officials, both Republican and Democrat, reports CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues.\u00a0But the agency is conducting an internal investigation into the social media statements of an agent who suggested she wouldn\u2019t put her life on the line for President Trump. According to a new report by the Washington Examiner , Kerry O\u2019Grady, special agent in charge of the Secret Service\u2019s Denver district, wrote on Facebook in October: \u201cI would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country\u2026\u201d She ended the post: \u201cI am with her\u201d \u2014 an implicit endorsement of Hillary Clinton. In the report, O\u2019Grady said her post was in reaction to the now-infamous 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video where Mr. Trump made lewd comments about groping women. But after posting the comments, O\u2019Grady said she had second thoughts, telling the Examiner: \u201cAs soon as I put it up, I thought it was not the sentiment that I needed to share because I care very deeply about the mission.\u201d She said she took down the post two or three days later. The Secret Service is aware of the posting and told CBS News that \u201cthe agency is taking quick and appropriate action \u2026 any allegations of misconduct are taken seriously and swiftly investigated.\u201d On Sunday, President Trump singled out Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy while at a law enforcement reception at the White House, telling the room he\u2019s felt safe with their protection since day one.\u00a0 Secret Service agents are barred from engaging in any political activity. CBS News reached out to O\u2019Grady, but we have yet to hear back. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Mr. Trump has repeatedly shifted his view of the election system. As a candidate, he frequently railed against what he called a \u201crigged\u201d election . When he became president-elect, he complained about \u201cserious voter fraud,\u201d but later reversed himself and mocked Ms. Stein\u2019s recount efforts as \u201ca scam\u201d and a waste of time and money. This week, he flip-flopped again, telling lawmakers at a White House reception that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote because millions of immigrants in the country illegally voted for her. Mr. Spicer declined to elaborate on what Mr. Trump meant but did not back away from the assertion. \u201cThe president does believe that,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a belief that he\u2019s maintained for a while, a concern that he has about voter fraud. And that\u2019s based on information that\u2019s provided.\u201d It remains unclear what form a federal investigation may take. While the F.B.I. has the authority to look into voter fraud, that appears not to be what the president has in mind. Mr. Spicer said it was too early to know, but mentioned the possibility of a task force or commission. He cited studies that he said showed that voter rolls contained the names of millions of people who should not be there because they had moved, were not citizens or had since died. But the author of one of those major studies said Wednesday that Mr. Spicer and the president appeared to be misunderstanding the numbers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story David Becker, who for six years was in charge of the election initiative for the Pew Center on the States, said that voter rolls often had out-of-date information, but that there was virtually no evidence that many of those names were used to vote illegally. \u201cIt does exist, but it happens in very, very small numbers and nothing like what is claimed by the president,\u201d Mr. Becker said. He said systems across the country to prevent voter fraud would have caught any huge effort to vote illegally. \u201cWe would have seen that well before the election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have seen a swelling of the voter rolls and records.\u201d In Ohio, for example, a review of the state\u2019s elections in 2012 and 2014 found that out of millions of votes cast, there were 667 allegations of fraud, of which just 149 were referred to law enforcement for investigation, Mr. Husted said. The Ohio review, which happens after every election, also found that 436 unauthorized immigrants were registered to vote and that 44 had voted. Photo The legal team representing then President-elect Donald J. Trump, including Donald F. McGahn II, the current White House counsel, argued in a brief that no voter fraud had occurred in the general election. \u201cVoter fraud exists. It\u2019s not widespread or systemic,\u201d said Mr. Husted, who said he had voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that that is happening on a wide-scale basis.\u201d Mr. Husted said he would be happy to share Ohio\u2019s review of the 2016 election with the federal government when it was completed. And he said Mr. Trump could aid states by sharing government databases that could help them clean their voter rolls. In his Twitter message Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested that a federal review could lead to improvements in voting procedures. But Democrats and voting experts criticized the president for focusing his allegations on voter fraud while resisting the intelligence community\u2019s conclusions involving Russian hacking of the Democratic National Commitee and officials connected to Mrs. Clinton during last year\u2019s election. \u201cIt\u2019s more important that we investigate the known instances of election fraud, rather than imagined ones,\u201d said Kim Alexander, the president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to improving the voting process. \u201cWe have had an election that was compromised by foreign interests. That\u2019s the real danger that has come out of this election.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the president should \u201cknock this off\u201d and move on. \u201cThis is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it,\u201d he said on CNN . And several Democratic lawmakers and state election officials said they suspected that Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations were part of a plan by Republicans looking for reasons to justify new restrictions on voting to benefit their party, particularly targeting immigrants and African-Americans. \u201cThere has been a sustained effort across the country, rooted in similar conspiracies about voter fraud, to make it harder for Americans to vote,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow this attack on voting rights to continue, and it\u2019s shameful to see such debunked conspiracy theories emanating from the White House.\u201d Mr. Padilla, the California secretary of state, said he also worried that Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated allegations about fraud would undermine the confidence that Americans had in the integrity of the voting system. \u201cStoking fear and concern is undermining people\u2019s faith in our elections,\u201d he said.

Trump insisted that his aim was to keep the nation safe and end \"one injustice after another\" for the families of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants. \"We hear you, we see you and you will never be ignored again,\" Trump told victims' relatives at a Department of Homeland Security event after he signed the orders. \"You children will not have lost their lives for no reason.\" The executive actions include redirecting existing Homeland Security money to erect what the administration described as a \"very large\" wall on the southern border with Mexico , a signature campaign promise. Additional detention facilities would also be built along the border, according to the action. \"And yes, one way or another, as the president has said, Mexico will pay for it,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters earlier Wednesday. The ultimate impact of the executive order on building a wall along border is not clear, because Congress would have to approve any additional appropriations. Trump is scheduled to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto next week in what could prove a tense faceoff as the two leaders discuss coordination, the dismantling of drug cartels and the flow of arms and cash between the two countries. \"They have to stop it. We have to stop it. We are going to save lives on both sides of the border,\"Trump said Wednesday.

The action also directs the hiring of 5,000 new border patrol agents and would triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The Trump administration will also regularly publish a list of jurisdictions that \"catch and release\" undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes and establish an office for the victims of those crimes. The Justice Department is directed to prioritize immigration prosecutions. Despite Trump's inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trail, which included calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and accusing them of \"bringing crime,\" immigration policy experts say it's tough to pin down figures on the numbers of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes. In a 2015 report, the Migration Policy Institute , a nonpartisan think tank, estimated that \"13 percent of the unauthorized immigrants in the U.S would be considered enforcement priorities\" under Obama administration executive actions that focused on non-citizens convicted of serious crimes. A law enforcement source who asked not be identified told NBC News on Wednesday that U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement has just more than 40,000 people in custody across the nation. Of those, 17,000 are foreign nationals with criminals records, according to the figures, which are for fiscal year 2017. The source said the number of people being detained is approaching maximum capacity even as the agency tries to find additional space. In fiscal year 2016, ICE removed 240,255 foreign nationals (PDF) , a slight increase from the previous fiscal year (2 percent) but a substantial decrease (24 percent) compared to fiscal year 2014. Even as the executive orders won plaudits from Republicans, many acknowledged that it was simply \"symbolic\" or, as Sen. David Perdue of Georgia said in a statement, \"a good first step towards fixing our immigration system and solving our national security crisis.\" Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview with Bloomberg before Trump signed the orders that Republicans \"finally have the political will to do this.\" But he went on to say that \"the term 'wall' is a bit symbolic\" and that it simply stands for \"securing and getting operational control of that border.\" McCaul also acknowledged that whatever form the wall takes, funding it remains an open question. Democrats were already pledging to fight a number of aspects of the orders \u2014 or even to ignore them altogether. Jim Kenney, the mayor of Philadelphia, a sanctuary city that would be subject to a federal funding cutoff, said the city wouldn't change its policy despite the orders. \"Given that today's EO was simply a directive and did not even make clear if there were any significant funding streams that the Trump administration could cut off to Philadelphia, we have no plans to change our immigration policy at this time,\" said the statement , which was first reported by The Philadelphia Inquirer. And the leader of the California state Senate, Kevin de Leon, hint that he go to court to challenge any move to cut off funding to California's sanctuary cities. Other actions, which could come as early as this week, may include temporarily limiting immigration to refugees and blocking visas for citizens of Middle Eastern and African countries deemed by the Trump administration to be particularly prone to terrorism. Those nations include Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. \"Donald Trump is making good on the most shameful and discriminatory promises he made on the campaign trail,\" the National Iranian American Council , a Washington-based nonprofit organization, said in a statement. \"He called for a Muslim ban and is now taking the first steps to implement one. This will not stand. The American people are better than this.\" Halimah Abdullah ",

REUTERS/Sandy Huffaker - RTX2TA95 A large majority of American voters believes they have achieved the American Dream -- or it\u2019s within sight for their family. The latest Fox News Poll also asks, what defines the American Dream today? \u00a0At the top, according to the national survey released Wednesday, is \u201cretiring comfortably.\u201d \u00a0Some 88 percent feel that is extremely or very important to realizing the dream. Next, 76 percent say \u201chaving a successful career\u201d is important. \u00a0That\u2019s followed by \u201craising a family\u201d (74 percent) and \u201cmaking a valuable contribution\u201d to their community (74 percent).\u00a0 \u201cOwning a home\u201d is seen as a big part of achieving the dream for nearly 7 in 10 (69 percent). \u00a0About 6 in 10 say \u201cgraduating college\u201d (61 percent) and \u201cbeing better off\u201d than their parents (57 percent). CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS. \u201cRetiring comfortably\u201d is the number one component of the Dream as defined by Baby Boomers (89 percent important), Generation Xers (88 percent), and Millennials (87 percent). \u00a0\u201cRaising a family\u201d is next for Boomers (80 percent) and Gen Xers (75 percent), yet for Millennials it is \u201chaving a successful career\u201d (81 percent). \u00a0 All in all, most believe their family has either achieved the American Dream (40 percent) or they\u2019re on their way toward doing so (43 percent). \u00a0 Fifteen percent feel it\u2019s \u201cout of reach.\u201d\u00a0 Expand / Contract \"These responses are consistent with those we\u2019ve seen in the past,\" says Republican Pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. \u00a0\"Even during relatively dark times -- and even as the country has polarized politically -- we tend to believe things will improve and our children will be better off than we are.\"\u00a0 Those in households earning $100,000 or more annually are 25 points more likely than those earning less than that to believe they\u2019ve realized the Dream (56 percent vs. 31 percent). By a 17-point margin, college graduates are more likely than those without a degree to think their family has made it (50 percent vs. 33 percent). \u00a0 One in five without a college degree (20 percent) says the American Dream is \u201cout of reach\u201d for their family. \u00a0 African-Americans are the most pessimistic about their family\u2019s chances, as more than one in four (26 percent) feel it is \u201cout of reach.\u201d\u00a0 The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,006 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from January 15-18, 2017. \u00a0The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 25, 2017 In the interview, Mr. Trump demurred when asked about whether it was hard having his family away from him, and he pointed to Thursday, when Mrs. Trump and Barron, who is finishing the school year in New York, are expected to return. \u201cThey\u2019ll come down on weekends,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe\u2019ll come down on Thursdays and stay.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story He said he was enjoying himself so far, despite his visible displeasure with the coverage of his inauguration and the first performance of his press secretary, Sean Spicer, who shouted at the news media and made numerous false statements about Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural crowds in the White House briefing room on Saturday. Mr. Trump and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, watched Mr. Spicer\u2019s do-over on Monday while eating lunch in the West Wing dining room, where the president murmured approval of Mr. Spicer\u2019s Monday performance and called his press secretary a \u201csuperstar.\u201d His first breakfast at the White House was Saturday morning \u2014 a buffet in the residence spread with fresh fruit, pastries and other treats \u2014 where his adult children and their families joined him. The kitchen has been stocked with the same types of snacks that Mr. Trump had on his private plane, including Lay\u2019s potato chips. His oldest daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser, stayed with him in the White House through Sunday. They left for their own new home at the end of the weekend to get their children ready for their new schools. Mr. Trump has not brought along any household staff from Trump Tower, an aide said. The president spent a part of Tuesday poring over artwork from the White House collections, settling on a portrait of Andrew Jackson \u2014 America\u2019s first populist president, who has been invoked by Mr. Trump\u2019s aides as inspiration \u2014 to hang in the Oval Office. \u201cNow, I\u2019m working,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview, punctuating his focus by cataloging the work of the day: an executive order restarting the Keystone XL pipeline and his plans for border-related actions over the next days. Mr. Trump is in the meantime pondering his first break away from the White House, a potential trip to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Fla., possibly the weekend of Feb. 3. Until then, he is breaking in the residence, which Mrs. Trump is still working on decorating. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful residence, it\u2019s very elegant,\u201d Mr. Trump said, deploying one of his highest forms of praise. \u201cThere\u2019s something very special when you know that Abraham Lincoln slept there,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe Lincoln Bedroom, you know, was his office, and the suite where I\u2019m staying is actually where he slept.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump was referring to the White House master bedroom, which is now his own. \u201cKnowing all of that, it\u2019s different, than, you know, just pure elegance and room size,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history.\u201d Follow The New York Times\u2019s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .

USA TODAY Mary Tyler Moore, seen here in 2009,  has died in a Connecticut hospital. (Photo: Charles Sykes, AP) Oh, Mary. Most of us, of course, never knew her personally. To us, she was Rob\u2019s wife or Rhoda\u2019s best friend, the woman who went from being the girl in the Capri pants with the high-wattage smile to the star of what just may be the best sitcom of all time, and the titular power behind a company that, with quality as its watchword, created a string of beloved TV classics. And yet she was more. There are some stars who seem to become part of our extended national family, whose death fills us with a sense of sorrow and regret that goes beyond what we would naturally, sensibly feel over the loss of an excellent actor. Mary Tyler Moore, who revolutionized the role of women on TV, dies at 80 That\u2019s the kind of star we had in Mary Tyler Moore, who died Wednesday at 80  after a long battle with diabetes. It doesn\u2019t matter that her last, big TV hit left the air nearly 40\u00a0years ago: Moore was always our Mary. What was it about her? Her looks didn\u2019t hurt: An unvarnished, ever-smiling beauty blended with far more sex appeal than you generally find in Hollywood\u2019s girl-next-door types. This is a woman, after all, whose first big TV break \u2014 playing the smoky-voiced secretary Sam on Richard Diamond, Private Detective\u00a0\u2014 featured her trained-dancer\u2019s legs alone. We didn\u2019t need the face; we had the voice and the gams. Really, has any TV star ever blended wholesome and hot as well as Moore? Rob and Laura may have had separate beds on The Dick Van Dyke Show\u00a0\u2014 this was, after all, the early \u201960s \u2014 but it didn\u2019t take much of an imagination to figure they were sometimes sharing the same one. Who could resist? Van Dyke\u00a0made her a star, and then went one step better: It made her one of TV\u2019s great actors. Viewers watching its opening episodes might well have concluded that all the laughs would come from Rob\u2019s work as a comedy writer, relegating the home front to shots of Laura kissing Rob hello when she was happy and wailing \u201cOh, Rob\u201d when she wasn\u2019t. But nurtured along by her writers and co-stars, Moore turned Laura into a comic gem in her own right \u2014 so much so that some of the best-loved episodes were built around her: Laura getting her toe stuck in a faucet, or destroying a family heirloom, or giving away Alan\u2019s toupee secret. Friends and co-stars share fond memories of Mary Tyler Moore It was a great role, but not a long-lasting one: Van Dyke\u00a0left the air in 1966, after just five award-winning seasons. Moore moved into movies, wisely with Thoroughly Modern Millie,\u00a0not so wisely with Change of Habit.\u00a0And even Habit\u00a0was a happier choice than the 1966 musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's,\u00a0one of Broadway\u2019s most infamous flops and Moore\u2019s most painful career experiences. Roughed up a bit, she returned to TV, and triumphed. Many supporting stars in sitcoms try to launch a show of their own, usually without success. Moore was not only the exception that proves the rule; with The Mary Tyler Moore Show, she reset them. Launched in 1970 on CBS, MTM introduced us to\u00a0 Mary Richards, a recently jilted single woman (not divorced, as originally\u00a0planned \u2014 that was considered too risqu\u00e9) launching a new life and career as a TV producer in Minneapolis. She was beautiful, she was smart, she was ambitious, and she took her career seriously, rather than seeing it as a pre-wedding way station. And while she was interested in marriage, waiting for it did not keep her from having an active sex life, a fact implied \u2014 though never, as it would be today, forced upon you. By making her a single woman in a new town, MTM\u00a0did more than open dating possibilities; it launched a new paradigm. In most earlier\u00a0sitcoms, \u201cwork\u201d and \u201chome\u201d were two separate worlds; you had friends at work and family at home, and while they might mingle, there was always a clear distinction between them. Her show blurred those distinctions: Her friends, at work and in her apartment building, became her family. It set the template for every workplace-as-family sitcom that followed. Friends and co-stars share fond memories of Mary Tyler Moore In MTM, Moore played the sane lead, providing a stable center for an orbiting crew of crazier characters. Yet in Moore\u2019s hands, \u201csane\u201d never meant\u00a0boring. Her Mary was funny enough to hold her own with the supporting characters, and yet \u201creal\u201d enough to carry the show\u2019s more serious episodes, including a famous one that had her forced to face a dependence on pills. Few shows, before or after, have ever had more impact on their medium than MTM.\u00a0It relaunched the career of Betty White, and made stars out of every member of the never-bettered supporting cast \u2014 Valerie Harper, Gavin MacLeod, Ted Knight, Ed Asner, Cloris Leachman and Georgia Engel \u2014 sending each into shows of their own, some spinoffs, some not. It forever drew a line between two styles of American sitcom, with the smart and literate on MTM\u2019s\u00a0side, and the dumb and silly (think Three\u2019s Company, the later-\u201970s flag-bearer) on the other. The result was not just a popular comedy that set a then-record for Emmy wins (29), and not just a series that expanded our idea of what women on TV could do. It was a sitcom that was then, and may still be, the best America has ever produced. The 'Mary Tyler Moore' cast, seen together in a 1975 set photo. (From left: White, Knight, Georgia Engel, Gavin MacLeod, Moore and Asner) \u00a0(Photo: CBS Photo Archive, Getty Images) In many ways, Moore\u2019s influence after MTM\u00a0left the air in 1977 \u2014 departing with one of the greatest finales ever filmed \u2014 was more as a businesswoman than a star. With her then-husband Grant Tinker, she founded MTM Enterprises, which went on to give us one of TV\u2019s proudest rosters: The Bob Newhart Show, Rhoda, Phyllis, Lou Grant, White Shadow, WKRP in Cincinnati, Hill Street Blues, Remington Steele, St. Elsewhere\u00a0and Newhart\u00a0to name more than a few. Not to mention giving us one of the great corporate logos, with its meowing cat replacing MGM\u2019s roaring lion. Her own series afterwards were not as successful: a sketch show and a later sitcom, both called Mary; a Mary Tyler Moore Hour\u00a0variety show; another sitcom called Annie McGuire. So she once again turned to movies and stage, garnering an Oscar nomination for 1980's\u00a0Ordinary People, an Emmy for Stolen Babies\u00a0(along with nominations for First, You Cry, Heartsounds\u00a0and Lincoln) and a Tony for Whose Life Is It Anyway. That\u2019s hardly a shameful lineup, but it is less than people expected after MTM.\u00a0No doubt it was hard for her to shake her Mary Richards image, but personal problems may have also stalled her career. She battled alcoholism. She lost her only child to an accidental shooting. And she waged her decades-long battle against  diabetes. And yet who can look back and not envy what she accomplished? How many actors get to play even one role as rich and well-loved as Laura Petrie or Mary Richards? How many stars can say that two of their sitcoms, Dick Van Dyke\u00a0and Mary Tyler Moore, regularly land on any list of the top 10 of all time? Indeed, how many actors move beyond \u201cstar\u201d to \u201cicon,\u201d and how many of those ever engender the long-lasting affection fans had for Moore? Who can turn the world on with her smile, indeed. And if we\u2019re not smiling now, odds are we will be the next time Laura sniffs \u201cOh Rob,\u201d or Mary tosses that meat into her shopping cart. Some work is just so good, and some stars so special, they never lose their power to please. Thanks, Mary. And goodbye. ",

    "text": "Trump draft order reportedly will halt refugee processing for Syrians Published               January 25, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President Donald Trump will order the U.S. government to stop accepting Syrian refugees and suspend the issuing of visas to people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, according to a draft executive order obtained by the Associated Press Wednesday.\u00a0 The AP also reported that the draft order shows Trump intends to suspend the United States' broader refugee program for 120 days. Citizens of\u00a0Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen would be unable to obtain U.S. visas for at least 30 days. Trump is expected to sign the order this week. It was not clear if the draft will be revised before then.\u00a0 According to the AP, Trump's draft shows that he will order Homeland Security and State Department officials, along with the director of national intelligence, to review what information the government needs to fully vet would-be visitors and come up with a list of countries that don't provide it. The order says the government will give countries 60 days to start providing the information or citizens from those countries will be barred from traveling to the United States. Exceptions would be made for diplomats, NATO visas or those people traveling to work at the United Nations. During the campaign Trump, said vetting procedures were inadequate and suggested that terrorists could pose as Syrian refugees to infiltrate the United States. While suspending visas for Syrians, Trump is also asking that officials from the departments of State and Defense to draft plans for safe zones in and around Syria. Trump has the authority to determine how many refugees are accepted annually and he can suspend the program at any time. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, restarting months later. During the last budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria and President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000. Trump, according to his yet-to-be-signed executive order, will cut that program by more half to 50,000. The order said while the program is suspended, the U.S. may admit people on a case-by-case basis \"when in the national interest\" and the government would continue to process refugee requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion....is a minority religion in the individual's country.\" That suggests that would allow the admission of Christians from Muslim-majority countries. Earlier Wednesday, Trump issued orders aimed at moving ahead with a wall on the Mexican border and blocking federal funds from \"sanctuary cities\" that protect immigrants. \u201cA nation without borders is not a nation,\u201d Trump declared after signing the measures, while speaking to employees at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cBeginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders.\u201d The first order calls for the \u201cimmediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border,\u201d and directs the DHS secretary to take \u201call appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct\u201d the wall using authority under existing law. While it\u2019s not yet clear exactly how the project might be funded or how much it would cost, Trump reiterated his vow that Mexico \u201cabsolutely\u201d will pay for the project eventually, something the Mexican government has denied. \u201cUltimately it will come out of what\u2019s happening with Mexico,\u201d Trump told ABC News in a separate interview, adding construction could begin in a matter of months. Mexico\u2019s contribution aside, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said existing Homeland Security funding could be used for now to get started, and congressional appropriations eventually would be needed. The order itself calls for the preparation of congressional budget requests. The same executive order also calls for hiring 5,000 more Border Patrol agents and ending \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d policies for illegal immigrants, among other provisions. Another order is aimed at helping federal immigration agents. It calls for hiring 10,000 additional officers; restoring the so-called Secure Communities program and other local partnerships; prioritizing the deportation of illegal immigrant criminals; directing the State Department to use leverage to ensure illegal immigrants are taken back by their country of origin \u2013 and moving to strip federal grant money to sanctuary states and cities that \u201charbor\u201d illegal immigrants.

(Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Mayor Rahm Emanuel reacts to the signing of an executive order regarding sanctuary cities by President Donald Trump on Jan. 25, 2017. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy As President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to cut off some federal funding from sanctuary cities, Mayor Rahm Emanuel vowed Chicago would remain one and continue to protect immigrants from deportation. \"We're gonna stay a sanctuary city,\" Emanuel said in a news conference after Wednesday's City Council meeting. \"There is no stranger among us. We welcome people, whether you're from Poland or Pakistan, whether you're from Ireland or India or Israel and whether you're from Mexico or Moldova, where my grandfather came from, you are welcome in Chicago as you pursue the American Dream.\" Emanuel declined to discuss specifics on what funding the city might lose, noting that he had not been briefed on the executive order, which the White House released about an hour after the mayor addressed reporters. Trump ordered Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to work with incoming Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ensure sanctuary cities \"are not eligible to receive federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes.\" The order states Kelly and Sessions should strip the funding that is within their discretion and consistent with the law. It also directs incoming Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to tabulate how much federal grant money is received by each of the country's sanctuary cities. It was not immediately clear how much federal funding could be at stake for Chicago. (Tribune news services) Cutting off all federal funding to sanctuary cities would require action by the Republican-controlled Congress. Last year, Chicago received a little more than $1 billion in federal grant funding for myriad programs, including early childhood education, transportation, policing, health initiatives, public assistance programs and disaster management. It's unknown how much of that $1 billion could be deemed necessary for law enforcement, as laid out by Trump's order. The city, however, does receive millions under the jurisdiction of the attorney general through the Justice Department . Justice officials issued a report last year that stated Chicago could stand to lose nearly $29 million in annual agency grants if it were to be found in violation of federal laws on detaining people to be turned over to immigration agents for possible deportation. Trump's order also calls for the hiring of 10,000 new immigration officers and for the deportation of immigrants living here illegally who have been convicted of a crime, been charged with a crime, committed acts that \"constitute a chargeable criminal offense,\" have abused a program related to public benefits, who have been subject to \"a final order of removal,\" or who in the judgment of an immigration officer \"pose a risk to public safety or national security.\" \"Federal agencies are going to unapologetically enforce that law, no ifs ands or buts,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a briefing with reporters. \"We're going to strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants. The American people are no longer going to have to be forced to subsidize this disregard for our laws.\" Donald Trump Chip Somodevilla / Getty President Donald Trump, with Vice President Mike Pence in the background, speaks during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security on Jan. 25, 2017. President Donald Trump, with Vice President Mike Pence in the background, speaks during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security on Jan. 25, 2017. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty) Emanuel's public statements reaffirming Chicago's sanctuary city status have come as the mayors of New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Philadelphia, Minneapolis and other major cities have done the same since Trump's election. At Wednesday's City Council meeting, aldermen overwhelmingly passed a resolution reaffirming that Chicago protects all residents regardless of race, ethnicity, immigration status, criminal record, gender identity and sexual orientation. In the process, aldermen took the time to bash Trump as a \"demagogue\" and recommit themselves to the city's long-held status as a sanctuary city. \"You mess with one in Chicago, you mess with all of us,\" said Northwest Side Ald. John Arena , 45th. \"We are a sanctuary city. We'll stand by that. We will stand by every single citizen, every single resident of this city, regardless of your status. This is your home. That is our declaration.\" Ald. Joe Moore , 49th, said Chicago \"should not give in to threats.\" \"Even if it means that our federal funding is threatened, now is the time to stand up for what is right, now is the time to stand up for our values, now  is the time to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves,\" Moore said. \"We should not give into any demagogue who happens to somehow accidentally find his way into the White House.\" ",

Toby Canham/Getty Images Butch Trucks, a drummer who was one of the founding members of The Allman Brothers Band, died Tuesday night, according to his publicist. He was 69. The group became iconic for its sprawling mix of Southern rock and jam-band improvisation \u2014 and Trucks was one of its rhythmic lynchpins. The Allman Brothers featured two drummers, Jaimoe Johansen and Butch Trucks. Their interlocking rhythms propelled the sound of the band in songs like \"Ramblin' Man,\" \"Whipping Post\" and \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed.\" Trucks was born in Jacksonville, Fla., in 1947. After he flunked out of college, he become a founding member of the Allman Brothers in 1969. Throughout the band's many ups and downs \u2014 which included three breakups and reunions \u2014 Trucks was a constant. As Trucks told Rolling Stone last year, \"I get to know what people were playing well enough that when they start going somewhere, once they arrive, I'm already there.\" After the Allman Brothers stopped touring two years ago, Trucks focused his attentions on another group, Butch Trucks and the Freight Train Band. Article continues after sponsorship The cause of death hasn't been announced. On the Allman Brothers' website, the surviving members of the group said Trucks died in West Palm Beach, Fla. ",

According to a project on the border barrier \u00a0by the University of Texas\u2019s law school, the United States sued \u201chundreds of private property owners to obtain title to their land to allow for construction of segments of the wall on that land.\u201d Resuming barrier construction on private lands will likely invite more lawsuits and logistical challenges. 3. Most of the border is natural, but a human-made barrier is not The southern border of Texas is technically somewhere in the middle of the Rio Grande. The river has changed course in the past, creating boundary disputes \u00a0between the United States and Mexico. The existing border fencing in southern Texas often sits far from the river, outside its flood plains \u2014 creating wide seams between the fence and the official border. Some Americans live on the Mexican side of the border fence. River Bend Resort , a golf course and residence in Brownsville, Tex., sits between a gap in the existing fence. If the wall were completed, based on U.S. regulations, it would bisect the property, according to owner Jeremy Barnard. Roughly 200 residents and 15 of the 18 golf holes would sit south of the border wall. \u201cWhat is the government\u2019s plan? Are they going to come and buy out 200 people of their houses?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to it than \u2018let\u2019s just build a wall.\u2019 \u201d 1,500 feet 1,500 feet 4. Surveillance makes the barrier effective Security experts say that border barriers are merely obstacles to would-be crossers unless they are watched. Former homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano famously remarked, \u201cYou show me a 50-foot wall, and I\u2019ll show you a 51-foot ladder.\u201d Fencing is just one part of the effort by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to secure the country\u2019s borders. The number of Border Patrol officers has doubled in recent years. Checkpoints strategically line roads along the border. Where no fencing exists, cameras and sensors do. Efforts to build a \u201cvirtual fence\u201d to supplement the physical barrier have proven challenging.

John Thune (R-S.D.) address reporters at the start of a two-day GOP strategy meeting in Philadelphia on Jan. 25, 2017. (Mark Makela/Reuters) By Mike DeBonis , Kelsey Snell and Ed O'Keefe By Mike DeBonis , Kelsey Snell and Ed O'Keefe January 25 at 5:55 PM Follow @mikedebonis Follow @kelsey_snell Follow @edatpost PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Republicans eagerly seeking answers from President Trump on how he plans to implement his agenda instead found themselves deflecting new questions Wednesday about the president\u2019s latest controversial pronouncements. House and Senate Republicans began the week expecting specific guidance on what will replace the Affordable Care Act, how quickly taxes might get slashed and how the government will pay for a new border wall and infrastructure plan. But on Wednesday, Trump offered up a fresh set of distractions with a flurry of announcements and early-morning tweets. He signed executive orders designed to jump-start construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and withhold federal funds to cities that do not comply with federal immigration laws. Word also came of a White House draft proposal to allow the CIA to reopen secret prisons overseas \u2014 and perhaps resume enhanced interrogation techniques. And Trump used Twitter to announce plans \u201cfor a major investigation\u201d into his unproved accusations of widespread voter fraud. That left Republicans scrambling with few details and fewer answers at a moment when they had intended to secure the opposite. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) The first signs of trouble came at midday Wednesday, when Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) faced reporters in a hotel ballroom here at the start of a two-day party strategy session. They came prepared to talk about health care and the tax code but were barraged with questions about Trump\u2019s latest moves. On voter fraud, Thune said he had not seen any evidence of widespread problems and declined to directly endorse Trump\u2019s investigation. \u201cIf they want to take that up, that is a decision that obviously he can make,\u201d Thune said. On the administration\u2019s plans to rethink how terrorism detainees are interrogated, Thune was stronger, emphasizing that Congress had settled the issue. \u201cWith respect to torture \u2014 that\u2019s banned,\u201d he said, citing a 2015 law that was approved overwhelmingly. Trying to get back on message, Thune added: \u201cWhat we have to do is focus on the things that unite us,\u201d including repealing Obamacare and revamping the tax code. Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, is interviewed at the Republican issues conference in Philadelphia on Jan. 25, 2017. (Mark Makela/Reuters) That is exactly what House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tried to do later in the afternoon. In a private gathering of lawmakers, the two GOP leaders laid out an aggressive legislative agenda calling for Congress to repeal major portions of the ACA, pass replacement measures and embark on a significant overhaul of the tax code \u2014 all within the first 200 days of blanket GOP control in Washington. What they didn\u2019t do is fully explain how these goals will be achieved, which is what most Republican lawmakers traveled to Philadelphia to learn. [ Trump is going after Republican orthodoxy. How will Paul Ryan respond? ] Interviews with more than a dozen GOP lawmakers revealed a clash of expectations between rank-and-file lawmakers to get started in disassembling Obamacare and party leaders who are all too aware of the obstacles and difficult choices ahead. \u201cExact, specific and detailed \u2014 that\u2019s what people want,\u201d said Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), the chairman of the House Rules Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re going to own this stuff, and we better be able to explain it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think you will see a plan,\u201d said Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio), chairman of a key subcommittee on health care. \u201cI think you will see components of a plan that are part of different pieces of legislation that will make up what will ultimately be the plan.\u201d In the private session, Ryan and McConnell declared repealing and replacing Obamacare their first order of business, with a target date for action within the next three months. The lawmakers also said they plan to move quickly on a broad rewrite of the tax code that is expected to include deep rate cuts while maintaining current revenue through changes to the international tax code, according to multiple lawmakers in the room who requested anonymity to describe the meeting. The leaders laid out a three-pronged plan to undermine Obamacare with a combination of new legislation, executive action by Trump and regulatory changes within his administration. They said a replacement law would require some Democratic support. Tax restructuring would follow on an ambitious schedule, members who attended the briefing said, with an eye toward passing that overhaul, at least in the House, before Congress breaks for its summer recess in August. Ryan told members that they would work toward a tax overhaul that would cut rates while roughly maintaining current revenue levels. \u201cHe laid out a very ambitious agenda,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.). \u201cWe\u2019re on an aggressive timetable; it was almost like a construction chart the way he laid it out.\u201d Additionally, a senior House appropriator, Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), announced plans to pass a special appropriations bill funding a Mexican border wall in the spring and to undo several major Obama-era regulations in the meantime. Also on the agenda: Drafting the first all-Republican budget in a decade with the goal of fund the government and avoiding a debt-ceiling crisis. One point of tension between Trump and lawmakers was on an infrastructure bill. Leaders told the crowd that the initial draft of their legislative agenda did not include any measure to boost transportation projects, but Trump himself had insisted on it. No details, such as a price tag or structure, were discussed, multiple members said. \u201cWithout the president\u2019s input, that would not have been the case,\u201d said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who advised the Trump transition. Trump is scheduled to address the gathering on Thursday, where he is expected to sketch out his legislative agenda for the coming months. Paying for Trump\u2019s proposals remains an unexplored subject. Many hard-line conservatives previously opposed large policy changes that would add greatly to the deficit, as many of Trump\u2019s proposals could. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t want to touch popular entitlement programs, but Hill Republicans \u2014 including Ryan and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the president\u2019s nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 have left the door open. One question among House Republicans is how many of the recommendations within the official House GOP policy blueprint, \u201cA Better Way,\u201d Trump will also take up. Also unclear is how much leverage these Republican lawmakers will have to negotiate with a president who does not like dissent and regularly takes to cable news and Twitter to lash out at critics. \u201cHe\u2019s only been there a couple of days, I get it, but we do need to know this: Is he going to be with us when we go forward? Where does he stand on these issues?\u201d said Rep. Roger Williams (R-Tex.). \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions we need to ask him so we know where he is, so we don\u2019t go out down the dirt road and he\u2019s going on down the freeway.\u201d Collins cautioned that Trump may not linger in Philadelphia and did not expect any significant progress on policy. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any nitty-gritty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be top-line. He\u2019ll say he\u2019s working closely with Pence and the leadership.\u201d But Collins acknowledged that any hints will be taken as directives by members who are eager for guidance from the president: \u201cThe more specific the president and his administration can be, it\u2019s safe to say that becomes the template.\u201d Amid Trump\u2019s early moves as president, Ryan and McConnell have taken pains to present a unified front on major policy issues, and their retreat will undoubtedly offer moments of comity \u2014 including an address from British Prime Minister Theresa May and a visit from former National Football League quarterback Peyton Manning. [ It\u2019s mostly kumbaya so far for Trump and Republicans in Congress ] Numerous lawmakers expressed faith that Trump\u2019s bluster could be translated into the familiar language of Republican policy \u2014 and almost all cited Pence, a former member of the House GOP leadership who will also attend the retreat Thursday, as a crucial emissary in bridging that divide. \u201cIt very much appears to me, particularly given that Mike Pence comes from the House, that we will have the central role as we ought to as the legislative body in driving legislation,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.). \u201cThey need us.\u201d Tiberi was more blunt about his views on bridging the divide. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this guy for two years,\u201d he told a small group of reporters. \u201cYou guys take him literally, and nobody else does. You\u2019ll learn eventually not to take him literally.\u201d O\u2019Keefe reported from Washington.

Rhode Island and Texas police on Jan. 16 arrested Yates, who had been living under a different name, Leina Waldberg, and she was charged with child snatching in Rhode Island.

Kilmartin's office said in a statement the decision to dismiss the charge was due to \"evidence that was not available or unknown to investigators prior to the discovery and apprehension of Ms. Yates and the laws in effect in 1988.\" That's the year a warrant was issued against Yates for felony child snatching, but she disappeared with her daughters, who were 3 \u00bd years and 10 months old at the time, in 1985. At the time of the disappearance, under Rhode Island law the children could not be considered abducted and no crime occurred, the Providence Journal newspaper reported in 1988 . The child snatching law was changed in response to Yates' disappearance, state police said. Related: How the 31-Year Missing Children Case Unfolded Attorney General's office spokesperson Amy Kempe declined to comment about what new evidence influenced the dismissal. The statement said the decision to drop the charge was made in part because \"the well-being of the missing children has been established.\" Russell Yates, left, holds a picture of his wife and children in 1988. At right, Yates speaks in the doorway of his home on Jan. 17 in Warwick, Rhode Island. Providence Journal via AP Yates' daughters both have families of their own in the Houston area. Their father, Russell Yates, told reporters from his home in Warwick last week that he just wants to be in contact with his children and didn't think charges would do anyone any good. \"I don't think it's going to help her, me or anybody else. I just want to see my kids,\" he said. State police said Yates fled after a domestic dispute. Her attorneys have claimed she was abused. Elaine Yates, 69, was brought back to Rhode Island and charged, and was told she could return to Houston on $50,000 bond. Attorneys for Elaine Yates, Bethany Macktaz and Lisa Holley on Wednesday applauded the dismissal and said she fled at a time when there were few legal options. A mugshot of Elaine Yates released on Jan. 17, 2017 after Yates was arrested in Houston, Texas. Harris County Sheriff / EPA \"We were very pleased to be able to share the news of the dismissal of the charges with our client,\" the attorneys told NBC affiliate WJAR . They said the \"unwarranted arrest\" has now exposed her identity and location. The missing children case garnered international attention and was featured on \"America's Most Wanted.\" Age-processed images of the mother and children appeared on the website of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. State police detectives followed leads to Canada, Colorado, Florida, Oregon, Maine and New Hampshire. Recruits were taught about the case, and it was reassigned to new detectives regularly. \"This one was handed down from generation to generation,\" Rhode Island State Police Lt. Col.

Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Greg Miller By Greg Miller January 25 at 1:58 PM Follow @gregpmiller An executive order apparently drafted by the Trump administration calls for a policy review that could authorize the CIA to reopen \u201cblack site\u201d prisons overseas and potentially restart an interrogation program that was dismantled in 2009 after using methods widely condemned as torture. The document, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, would revoke former president Barack Obama\u2019s decision to end the CIA program and would require national security officials to evaluate whether the agency should resume interrogating terrorism suspects. The unsigned draft represents the clearest signal from President Trump that he intends to at least explore ways to fulfill campaign vows to return the CIA to a role that supporters claim produced critical intelligence on al-Qaeda but that ended in a swirl of criminal investigations, strained relationships with allies, and laws banning the use of waterboarding and other brutal interrogation tactics. [ What are \u2018black sites\u2019? 6 key things to know about the CIA\u2019s secret prisons overseas. ] The proposal also puts a renewed focus on the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying it should be used for newly captured prisoners. No detainee has been sent there since Obama took office in 2009 and attempted to close the facility. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post) White House press secretary Sean Spicer cast doubt on the provenance of the draft document Wednesday, saying that \u201cit is not a White House document\u201d and \u201cI have no idea where it came from.\u201d The document was provided to The Post by a person who said it had been circulated among agencies in Washington for comment. The immediate feedback, this person said, helped convince the White House counsel that the document needed wider distribution and review before being finalized. It was unclear which agencies received the document, but those with the most direct stake would include the CIA, the Pentagon, and the State and Justice departments. It\u2019s not yet clear whether Trump will sign the draft order, or whether senior members of his administration who have been skeptical of such plans, including Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, were consulted. Members of Congress denounced the draft order, which was first reported by the New York Times on Wednesday. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that Trump \u201ccan sign whatever executive orders he likes. But the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America.\u201d Human rights organizations expressed outrage. The draft order \u201cauthorizes the CIA to restart their detention program, which was the source of so much of the torture that undermined our national security,\u201d said Elisa Massimino, president of Human Rights First. Those policies \u201cmade fighting the war harder and strengthened the resolve of our enemies. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here.\u201d The draft, labeled \u201cDetention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants,\u201d notes that the United States has \u201crefrained from exercising certain authorities critical to its defense\u201d in the war against terrorism, including \u201ca halt to all classified interrogations by the Central Intelligence Agency.\u201d (Reuters) [ Read the draft of the executive order on CIA \u2018black sites\u2019 ] The document stops short of instructing the CIA to rebuild prisons or resume interrogating terrorism suspects. Instead it calls for reviews leading to recommendations to the president on whether he should \u201creinstate a program of interrogation of high-value alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States and whether such a program should include the use of detention facilities operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.\u201d The order would vacate Obama\u2019s decisions to dismantle the CIA program during his first days in office and would restore a 2007 order issued by President George W. Bush that sought to salvage the CIA\u2019s ability to capture and hold terrorism suspects after it had abandoned waterboarding and other extreme tactics. Any attempt to resume the CIA\u2019s use of coercive methods at overseas prisons would face major obstacles. Among them is whether another country would be willing to allow such a facility after those that did so more than a decade ago \u2014 including Lithuania, Poland and Thailand \u2014 faced international condemnation for their complicity. CIA veterans have said the agency has no desire to return to an assignment that continues to have damaging repercussions. A lawsuit against the architects of the program has forced the agency to release embarrassing documents, including internal memos showing that some employees were deeply troubled by the interrogation program from the outset. \u201cI just have to think there would be huge resistance and pushback,\u201d said John Rizzo, the former acting general counsel of the CIA. \u201cI think, personally, it would be a huge mistake for CIA to get anywhere near a new detention and interrogation program given the years of histories and controversies and investigations.\u201d The order would also presumably face opposition from senior figures in the Trump administration. Mattis, in particular, has argued against deviating from the techniques outlined in the Army Field Manual, a position that Trump said had caused him to reexamine his views after discussing the issue with Mattis in November The draft executive order, which states that it shall be implemented \u201cconsistent with applicable law,\u201d would not overturn any law banning torture. The 2016 National Defense Authorization Act reaffirmed laws limiting interrogation techniques to those used in the Army Field Manual and barring \u201cthe use or threat of use of force.\u201d Some legal experts cast the draft order as part of moves by Trump, including his plan to limit visas for people from Muslim countries, as cynical political gestures designed to energize his most ardent supporters while changing little in practice. \u201cThe president would get a huge symbolic boost with his base while not violating the law and while changing nothing of substance,\u2019\u2019 Jack Goldsmith , a former head of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel and a Harvard Law School professor, said in an interview. \u201cHe would get maximum symbolic value while doing nothing. Trump\u2019s a genius at this.\u201d But Goldsmith, who as the OLC chief rescinded some of the Bush administration\u2019s torture memos, also predicted that Trump would \u201cregret\u201d this executive order, if it is issued, and that the \u201csymbolic bang that Trump sought would backfire\u201d on the administration. The document acknowledges that existing laws provide \u201ca significant statutory barrier to the resumption of the interrogation program.\u201d Congress\u2019s authorization of the fiscal 2016 defense budget turned into law sections of Obama\u2019s 2009 executive orders on detention and interrogation. It prohibits the use of any interrogation techniques not authorized or listed in the Army Field Manual on anyone in the custody of or controlled by any agency or employee of the U.S. government. The law requires that the manual itself must be available to the public and that the International Committee of the Red Cross be notified and given \u201cprompt access\u201d to anyone detained in an armed conflict by any agent of the U.S. government, including contractors and subcontractors. [ The rise and fall of the CIA\u2019s secret overseas prisons ] The draft order copy obtained by The Post contains editing marks and significant errors, including a reference to \u201cthe atrocities of September 11, 2011,\u201d missing the actual date of the 2001 attacks by a decade. Some of the edits seem driven by a political impulse to distance Trump\u2019s administration from those of Obama and Bush. Trump frequently accused Obama of being reluctant to call certain attacks \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Edits to the draft add references to \u201cIslam.\u201d The phrase \u201cglobal war on terrorism,\u201d coined by the Bush administration, is also struck out and replaced with \u201cfight against radical Islamism.\u201d There are other problematic assertions in the draft. It states, for example, that more than 30\u00a0percent of the detainees released from Guantanamo Bay \u201chave returned to armed conflict.\u201d But statistics from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which tracks detainee matters, suggest that figure is closer to 18\u00a0percent.

Here's a look at her career. (Jan. 25, 2017) Beloved TV icon Mary Tyler Moore has died at 80. Here's a look at her career. (Jan. 25, 2017) Dennis McLellan Mary Tyler Moore, the multiple Emmy-winning actress who charmed TV viewers on \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show\u201d in the 1960s and became a symbol of American feminism on  \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d in the 1970s, has died. She was 80. In a career that began as Happy Hotpoint, the dancing and singing 3-inch pixie in Hotpoint appliance commercials on \u201cThe Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\u201d in 1955 when she was 18, Moore went on to star in television and films and on Broadway. But her long-running role as Mary Richards, the comfortably single working woman who stood up to her boss in the newsroom and got by on equal parts humor and independence, help define American womanhood in an era when feminism was still taking root. Former First Lady Michelle Obama was among those who said she drew inspiration from Moore\u2019s portrayal of Mary Richards. \u201cShe was one of the few single working women depicted on television at the time,\u201d Obama told Variety magazine last August. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t married. She wasn\u2019t looking to get married. At no point did the series end in a happy ending with her finding a husband \u2014 which seemed to be the course you had to take as a woman.\u201d \u201cMary Tyler changed the world for all woman,\u201d tweeted Ellen DeGeneres, who invited Moore to play herself in several episodes of the sitcom \u201cEllen\u201d and considered herself an admirer.\u00a0 Moore also found success in film. In 1981, she received an Academy Award nomination for best actress for her portrayal of the emotionally cold mother in \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d the Robert Redford -directed drama about an upper-middle-class family dealing with the death of its eldest son in a boating accident with his brother. The unsympathetic, dark role was a departure for Moore, who remains best known for her light touch in two classic situation comedies that, together, earned her six Emmy Awards . Moore was still largely unknown when she was cast as Laura Petrie, the suburban housewife and mother of a young son opposite Van Dyke\u2019s TV comedy writer husband Rob on \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show.\u201d The acclaimed sitcom, which aired on CBS from 1961 to 1966, earned Moore her first two Emmys and made her a star. Her Capri-pants-wearing Laura brought something new to the traditional sitcom role of wife and mother: youthful sex appeal. As Carl Reiner, the series\u2019 creator, said of Rob and Laura in a 2004 TV Guide interview: \u201cThese were two people who really liked each other.\u201d Moore agreed, saying: \u201cWe brought romance to comedy, and, yes, Rob and Laura had sex!\u201d Van Dyke often praised Moore\u2019s abilities as a comedic actress \u2014 one who has been credited with turning crying into a comedic art form and who memorably got her toe stuck in a hotel room bathtub faucet in one episode. \u201cShe was one of the few who could maintain her femininity and be funny at the same time,\u201d Van Dyke said in a 1998 interview with the Archive of American Television. \u201cYou have to go as far back as Carole Lombard or Myrna Loy to find someone who could play it that well and still be tremendously appealing as a woman.\u201d After the Van Dyke show ended in 1966, Moore starred as Holly Golightly later that year in a problem-plagued Broadway musical version of \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d that producer David Merrick closed after four previews in New York. Moore also played Julie Andrews\u2019 roommate in the hit 1967 flapper-era comedy-musical movie \u201cThoroughly Modern Millie.\u201d But her budding film career, which included playing a nun opposite Elvis Presley\u2019s ghetto doctor in \u201cChange of Habit,\u201d was less than stellar. Then she was reunited with Van Dyke in a 1969 musical-variety TV special, a critical and ratings success that spurred CBS to offer her a commitment to do her own half-hour comedy series. Moore and her second husband, TV executive Grant Tinker, created MTM Enterprises, their own independent TV production company whose logo \u2014 in a takeoff on MGM\u2019s roaring lion \u2014 was a meowing orange kitten. Tinker hired writers James L. Brooks and Allan Burns to create and produce \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d which debuted on CBS in 1970 and made TV history. SNAP Video See more videos The series, featuring Moore as Mary Richards, a single woman in her 30s who lands a job as an associate producer in\u00a0a Minneapolis TV newsroom, won 29 Emmys during its seven-year run. Four of those Emmys went to Moore, whose character Mary became a symbol of the independent 1970s career woman. As Ed Asner\u2019s lovably gruff Lou Grant tells her when she applies for a job in the newsroom at WJM-TV: \u201cYou know what? You\u2019ve got spunk. I hate spunk.\u201d The MTM empire grew to include series such as \u201cThe Bob Newhart Show,\u201d \u201cRhoda,\u201d \u201cLou Grant,\u201d \u201cRemington Steele,\u201d \u201cWKRP in Cincinnati,\u201d \u201cHill Street Blues\u201d and \u201cSt. Elsewhere.\u201d After \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d left the air in 1977, Moore failed with two TV comedy variety shows within the next two years. But she scored on Broadway, winning a special Tony Award in 1980 for her performance as the quadriplegic lead character in the Broadway revival of \u201cWhose Life Is It Anyway?\u201d, a part originally written for a man. In 1993, Moore won her seventh Emmy \u2014 for her supporting role as the ruthless owner of a 1940s Tennessee adoption agency in the Lifetime cable drama \u201cStolen Babies.\u201d But her two returns to the sitcom format in the mid- and late\u00a0\u201980s \u2014 \u201cMary\u201d and \u201cAnnie McGuire\u201d \u2014 were short-lived, as was the 1995 newspaper drama \u201cNew York News,\u201d on which she played the autocratic editor-in-chief of a tabloid newspaper. In the years after \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d she dealt with a series of personal problems and tragedies. In 1978, her younger sister, Elizabeth, died of a drug overdose. In 1980, Richie, her 24-year-old son from\u00a0her first marriage, fatally shot himself in what was ruled an accident. And in 1992, Moore\u2019s brother John, a recovering alcoholic, died after a long battle with kidney cancer. In the mid-\u201980s, Moore checked into the Betty Ford Center to seek treatment for alcoholism. In a 1986 interview with Maclean\u2019s magazine, Moore said: \u201cI am glad I was able to be a kind of role model for other women who identified with my ladylike qualities, who were then able to say, \u2018Well, if Mary can admit she had a problem with alcohol, then maybe I can too.\u2019\u201d Moore was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 29, 1936. Her father was a clerk for Consolidated Edison who worked at the Southern California Gas Co. after the family moved to Los Angeles in 1945. Hollywood Walk of Fame: Mary Tyler Moore Open link Moore began taking dance classes while in grade school and appeared in recitals. She continued to take dance lessons and perform through her years at Immaculate Heart High School, where she dreamed of dancing her way to stardom. In her autobiography, Moore described her strict Catholic father as \u201cundemonstrative\u201d and her more fun-loving mother as an alcoholic. As a result, Moore spent half the time living with her parents and the other half living with her aunt and grandmother. \u201cIt was not an ideal home life,\u201d she said in a 1999 interview with the Ottawa Citizen, noting that, even if her mom and dad \u201cweren\u2019t the best of parents,\u201d they had the best sense of humor. \u201cThank God, I was not abused in any way, but I was seeking approval of some sort, in many different ways,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, it turned out to be a pat on the back for entertaining people.\u201d She was 18 and five months from graduating from high school in 1955 when she met 27-year-old Dick Meeker, an Ocean Spray cranberry products salesman, who moved into a small apartment in the house next door to her parents\u2019 home. They were married two months after she graduated, and their son Richie was born the following year. As a working mother, Moore found jobs dancing in the chorus of \u201cThe Eddie Fisher Show\u201d and other TV variety shows and appeared in commercials. ",

    "text": "Donald Trump Is Moving Forward With His Wall. Is It Really Going To Happen? President Trump has signed two executive orders related to immigration and border security, moving ahead with his plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and to deport people who are in the country illegally. Trump signed the orders at the Department of Homeland Security Wednesday, shortly after the agency's new leader, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, was sworn in. YouTube \"Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders,\" Trump said in an address at the Homeland Security Department. The move comes less than one week before Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is slated to visit Trump in Washington on Jan. 31. Trump emphasized that the actions were in partnership with Mexico. \"The secretary of homeland security, working with myself and my staff, will begin immediate construction of a border wall,\" Trump said. News that the border wall plan is moving forward was criticized by Amnesty International USA, whose executive director, Margaret Huang, said, \"This wall would say that those from outside the United States, especially from Latin America, are to be feared and shunned \u2014 and that is just wrong.\" Trump said in an interview with ABC News that the U.S. will be \"reimbursed at a later date\" by Mexico for the costs of building the wall \u2014 an idea that Pe\u00f1a Nieto flatly rejected earlier this month . President Trump tells @ABC News: Mexico will \u201cabsolutely\u201d reimburse U.S. for border wall. https://t.co/MgcLG1hJH0 pic.twitter.com/NlxLs4N6SF \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) January 25, 2017 The cost of building such a wall has been estimated at at least $12 billion and perhaps $15 billion for a single-layer barrier. Roughly a third of the U.S.-Mexico border is currently blocked by a fence, as NPR's John Burnett has reported : \"According to an eight-year-old estimate by the Government Accountability Office , the border fence cost the government $3 million to $4 million a mile to build. Estimates for additional fencing \u2014 in harsher terrain \u2014 could surpass $10 million a mile.\" Article continues after sponsorship The border wall is included in an executive order titled Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements . It calls on Kelly to \"identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border.\" The directive calls for hiring more Border Patrol agents and prioritizing the prosecution of criminal offenses related to the Southern border. It also expands detention capacity \u2014 a move that could increase the use of private for-profit prisons.

Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images President Trump has signed an order to begin building a new wall along the border between Mexico and the U.S. Here, the border is seen from the community of Sasabe in Sonora state, Mexico, earlier this month. Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images The Justice Department had already beefed up border prosecutions under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The new action suggests law enforcement will be more empowered to prosecute for minor offenses and remove those in the country illegally. A second executive order, titled Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States , directs the departments of Homeland Security and Justice to withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities . In that action, Trump is also restoring the Secure Communities Program \u2014 which had ceased to operate in 2014 after being used by both the Bush and Obama administrations to force state and local governments to share fingerprints and other data to help federal officials identify unauthorized immigrants. Several states and cities sought to opt out of that system, which was also criticized for sometimes resulting in cases of mistaken detention of U.S. citizens . One critic of Trump's executive orders, Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said there are better ways to keep the country safe than to crack down on sanctuary cities. Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 \"Pressuring local law enforcement to take on immigration responsibilities undercuts the very oath they take to 'serve and protect' the entirety of their community. Smart law enforcement is built on intelligence gathering and trust, which are dramatically undermined once the cop on the corner is asking victims of crime about their immigration status,\" he said. Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors immigration limits, said in an email that the administration's battle with sanctuary cities is just beginning. \"Who will blink first\u2014cities or the federal government? Cutting off their money is step one. LA and New York will not change their policies. This will play out for years,\" he said. Wednesday's executive order also seeks to force other nations to take back criminals in the U.S. illegally by using leverage such as withholding U.S. visas. And it will allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to more aggressively arrest, detain and remove people from the U.S. It also calls for the hiring of 10,000 additional immigration officers. The order also will create an \"Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens,\" aimed to support these victims and their families. The order does not detail exactly how these victims will be supported but states that the office will \"provide quarterly reports studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.\" The actions come one day after the president tweeted about new immigration policies, saying Tuesday night, \"Among many other things, we will build the wall.\" Construction of a border wall was a keystone of Trump's presidential campaign. Questions still surround the details of the plan for a wall \u2014 chief among them, how the undertaking would be paid for. A law already exists that experts say gives Trump the authority to start building the wall. It is the Secure Fence Act of 2006 . It was bipartisan and overwhelmingly supported during the Bush administration. The 2006 law envisions both physical barriers and high-tech features, like sensors and cameras. It also mentions a two-layer fence \u2014 but that fence was never built, and the legislation didn't include money to pay for one. Ten years later, the process could begin in earnest. ",

One was Mr. Obama\u2019s directive to close the Guant\u00e1namo prison and the other was his directive to end C.I.A. prisons, grant Red Cross access to all detainees and limit interrogators to the Army Field Manual techniques. In their place, Mr. Trump\u2019s draft order would resurrect a 2007 executive order issued by President Bush. It responded to a 2006 Supreme Court ruling about the Geneva Conventions that had put C.I.A. interrogators at risk of prosecution for war crimes, leading to a temporary halt of the agency\u2019s \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogations program. Mr. Bush\u2019s 2007 order enabled the agency to resume a form of the program by specifically listing what sorts of prisoner abuses counted as war crimes. That made it safe for interrogators to use other tactics, like extended sleep deprivation , that were not on the list. Mr. Obama revoked that order as part of his 2009 overhaul of detention legal policy. One of the Obama orders Mr. Trump\u2019s draft order would revoke also limited interrogators to using techniques listed in the Army Field Manual. But in 2015, Congress enacted a statute locking down that rule as a matter of law , as well as a requirement to let the Red Cross visit detainees. Those limits would remain in place for the time being. Lasting Scars Articles in this series examine the American legacy of brutal interrogations. Still, the draft order says high-level Trump administration officials should conduct several reviews and make recommendations to Mr. Trump. One was whether to change the field manual, to the extent permitted by law. Another was \u201cwhether to reinitiate a program of interrogation of high-value alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States\u201d by the C.I.A., including any \u201clegislative proposals\u201d necessary to permit the resumption of such a program. It was not clear whether the C.I.A. would be enthusiastic about resuming a role in detaining and interrogating terrorism suspects after its scorching experience over the past decade. In written answers to questions by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump\u2019s C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo , said he would review whether a rewrite of the field manual was needed and left the door open to seeking a change in the law \u201cif experts believed current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump\u2019s order says no detainee should be tortured or otherwise subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment \u201cas prescribed by U.S. law,\u201d but it makes no mention of international law commitments binding the United States to adhere to humane standards even if Congress were to relax domestic legal limits on interrogations, such as the Convention Against Torture or the Geneva Conventions. Another core national security legal principle for Mr. Obama was to use civilian courts, not military commissions, whenever possible in terrorism cases \u2014 and to exclusively use civilian law enforcement agencies and procedures, not the military, to handle cases arising on domestic soil. The draft order also signals that the Trump administration may shift that approach as well.

(Elise Amendola/AP) By Sari Horwitz and Jenna Johnson By Sari Horwitz and Jenna Johnson January 25 at 6:37 PM Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @wpjenna President Trump\u2019s plans to ask for a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d into allegations of widespread voter fraud were met with skepticism by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers \u2014 and fear from voting rights advocates that the president will use his unfounded claims to justify more-restrictive voting laws. It is unclear who will investigate Trump\u2019s belief that he lost the popular vote in November\u2019s election because millions of illegal votes were cast. The president could set up an independent commission or task force to look into the claims, which have already been disproved by many national studies. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the president\u2019s investigation would examine \u201cthe integrity of our voting system\u201d and not just the 2016 election. The Justice Department, which investigates claims of election crimes, has not historically launched a criminal investigation at the request of a president. An attorney general could order an investigation, but Trump\u2019s nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, has not yet been confirmed, and his spokeswoman declined to comment. Justice officials said they knew nothing about an investigation into voter fraud and referred questions to the White House. Former assistant attorney general for civil rights Tom Perez, who oversaw the department\u2019s voting section under the Obama administration, called Trump\u2019s announcement of a voter fraud probe \u201ca totally stupid and wasteful investigation into nonexistent problems.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more colossal waste of taxpayer dollars than to initiate this investigation,\u201d said Perez, who was also labor secretary and is now a candidate for chair of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThis is all about ego. The issue of in-person voting fraud is virtually nonexistent.\u201d (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) [ Here are nine major investigations on voter fraud that found virtually nothing. ] In back-to-back tweets on Wednesday, Trump said the investigation would cover \u201cthose registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal\u201d and \u201cthose registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time).\u201d News outlets reported Wednesday that Trump\u2019s daughter \u00adTiffany, White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin were all registered to vote in two states. \u201cDepending on results,\u201d Trump added in his tweet, \u201cwe will strengthen up voting procedures.\u201d Former Justice spokesman Matthew Miller said this is exactly the fear of voting rights advocates \u2014 that such an investigation will be used to endorse more- restrictive voting laws. \u201cThat\u2019s where this is going,\u201d Miller said. Civil rights groups are specifically worried about an action the Justice Department took three hours after Trump\u2019s inauguration on one of the most controversial voting laws in the country \u2014 a 2011 voter ID law in Texas, which every judge who has considered it has found to be discriminatory. On Friday, Justice officials asked for a months-long delay in a hearing in the case so they can determine their next course of action, which could include dropping out of the case altogether. Trump called for the voter fraud investigation after insisting during a private reception with congressional leaders on Monday that there were between 3\u00a0million and 5\u00a0million ballots illegally cast in the election, allowing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to win the popular vote by more than 2.8\u00a0million votes. Clinton ultimately lost the electoral college vote to Trump. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said he has \u201cseen no evidence\u201d to that effect, and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said that the president\u2019s allegations were undermining faith in the democratic system. \u201cI would urge the president to knock this off,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis is the greatest democracy on Earth. We\u2019re the leader of the free world. And people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification.\u201d Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see the evidence [of fraud], but he\u2019s the president, and if he thinks it\u2019s there, have at it.\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Trump\u2019s claim \u201cabsolute nonsense,\u201d and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she could not understand why the newly installed president is \u201cso insecure.\u201d Pelosi called Trump\u2019s focus on voter fraud \u201creally strange\u201d \u2014 especially because his own lawyers disputed allegations of ballot irregularities when Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein challenged the results in some states last fall. \u201cAll available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers stated in a recent court filing in that case. \u201cI frankly feel very sad for the president making this claim,\u201d Pelosi added. \u201cI felt sorry for him. I even prayed for him \u2014 but then I prayed for the United States of America.\u201d The organization that represents secretaries of state who run local elections said it is \u201cnot aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by President Trump.\u201d Ohio\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted questioned the need for a voter fraud investigation, saying that Ohio conducted a review four years ago and has another review of the 2016 election underway. \u201cEasy to vote, hard to cheat,\u201d Husted tweeted. The president and his aides have yet to provide any verifiable facts to back up his claim, and analyses of the election found virtually no confirmed cases of voter fraud, let alone millions. While there have always been some isolated instances of alleged voter fraud, voting experts say there is no evidence of widespread fraud that affects elections. \u201cI think taking the necessary steps to study and to track what we can do to both understand this, the scope of the problem, and then, secondly, how to stop the problem going forward is something that\u2019s definitely, clearly in the best interest,\u201d Spicer said. Spicer cited research that he said backs up Trump\u2019s claims. But Spicer cited a Pew study that does not support this claim. He also conflated the Pew study with another study that also does not support the voter fraud claim. A 2012 Pew Center on the States study found problems with inaccurate voter registrations, people who registered in more than one state, which can happen if the voter moves and registers in the new state without notifying the other state, and deceased voters whose information was still on the voter rolls. The primary author of the Pew report tweeted in response to the Trump staff\u2019s claim that he \u201ccan confirm that report made no findings re: voter fraud.\u201d Spicer also referenced a Pew study from 2008 showing that \u201c14\u00a0percent of people who have voted were not citizens.\u201d Research by Old Dominion University professors \u2014 not Pew \u2014 using data from 2008 and 2010 found that 14\u00a0percent of noncitizens in the samples said they were registered to vote. But the researchers warned that \u201cit is impossible to tell for certain whether the noncitizens who responded to the survey were representative of the broader population of noncitizens.\u201d One of the researchers, Jesse Richman, wrote about the Trump staff\u2019s use of his research. The results \u201csuggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions,\u201d he wrote. Perez suggested that before Trump launches his investigation, \u201che might want to talk to the governor of Texas,\u201d where a task force studying voter fraud found none, Perez said. Perez said that in the Texas voter ID lawsuit brought by the Justice Department, the state acknowledged a voter fraud task force finding that over a 10-year period, 46\u00a0million people voted in the state and there were no instances of illegal voting by noncitizens. There were only two instances of in-person voter fraud, he said. Matt Zapotosky and Michelle Ye Hee Lee contributed to this report. Read more: ",

By Robin Givhan By Robin Givhan January 25 at 6:00 AM Follow @RobinGivhan The president embraces the pocket square. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) Team Trump believes in the power of image. The new president believes that a single photograph, re-tweeted ad nauseam, can form the basis of a narrative. He believes the actors in his White House drama should look the part, whether patriotic or powerful. Fashion is costuming. In a striking case of character assassination by tailoring, Sean Spicer, the president\u2019s freshly appointed press secretary, stepped to the podium over the weekend for a briefing that disappointed the president, The Washington Post later reported . He was wearing a gray pinstriped suit jacket that looked as though it had been hurriedly borrowed from a man twice his size. The sleeves were sloppy; the collar didn\u2019t fit; the fabric looked cheap. The tie was poorly knotted. The shirt collar was so snug that his neck overflowed its boundaries. Spicer\u2019s attire was not just a tad ill-fitting. It was distracting and sloppy. It epitomized the clich\u00e9 style of the used-car salesman . Spicer\u2019s clothes wholly undercut a message that was already riddled with falsehoods. [ The fashion of politics: a database of political costuming choices past and present ] All that had changed by Monday afternoon. When Spicer returned to the press briefing room for a televised news conference, he was wearing a dark suit that fit. Not perfectly, but better. The tie was neat. He even had a white handkerchief tucked into his breast pocket. It was a visual do-over, one that suggested he was better prepared, more focused, more dignified. By Tuesday, Spicer seemed to have found his sartorial groove.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Two days later, a more polished Sean Spicer. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) The Trump White House has\u00a0been busy with optics over these past few days. The president still does not button his suit jacket and still wears his ties too long, but in recent days he has added a pocket square to his wardrobe\u00a0\u2014 a nonessential flourish that gives his appearance more polish. [ The casual-Friday look that GOP candidates can\u2019t get enough of ] Even Stephen K. Bannon, sworn in as counselor to the president, seems to have publicly parted ways with his button-downs, polo shirts and field jackets.

(Ron Sachs/Pool via Bloomberg) Meanwhile, senior aide Kellyanne Conway has been using her high visibility to underscore patriotism of the loud, chanting variety: USA! USA! USA! As she routinely steps in front of cameras to defend, interpret and parse the president\u2019s statements for the public, her fashion choices stand in lieu of having an American flag unfurl behind her. For the candlelight dinner with donors the day before the inauguration, she wore a\u00a0one-shoulder, floor-sweeping gown in bright red. Kellyanne Conway draped in patriotic red, at the Candlelight Dinner. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) For the Friday swearing-in, she chose a red, white and blue Gucci coat \u00a0\u2014 a self-promotional victory lap in the guise of irrepressible patriotism. Indeed, Conway chose to wear an Italian brand on a day when the man she helped elect president was exhorting \u201cBuy American. Hire American.\u201d And then, when she appeared on Sunday morning television and thrust \u201calternative facts\u201d into the cultural lexicon, she accessorized her ensemble with a glittering Ann Hand brooch that was inspired by the presidential seal, only this one including the Trump name. It was the kind of elaborate insignia that one might assume means something significant when, in fact, it is just sparkle. Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway on Inauguration Day. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Conway, wearing her presidential brooch, prepares to appear on the Sunday morning show \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Appearance matters, particularly at the White House. In some small way, the unruly, inartful, messy nature of politics is tempered by the dignity and solemnity of the place. There is something laudable about dressing in a manner that shows respect for everything that the White House represents. President George W. Bush understood that when he decreed jackets and ties for men\u00a0entering the Oval Office. And in 2009, when President Obama loosened those rules, it caused a stir in official Washington. It also makes sense that if one wants to be taken seriously by a wildly diverse populace, it helps to embrace the universal style markers of professionalism, seriousness and authority. People also tend to stand up straighter and be more focused when their attire is more formal and elegant. And, in the case of Spicer, no one wants to regularly look at a guy whose public style is akin to a visual pummeling. But image is always secondary to substance. It may briefly distract from a narrative or add to it. But surely, it can\u2019t change it. First ladies tend to make a statement with their inaugural dress choice. But this year, several designers have spoken out against working with the new first lady, Melania Trump. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) lifestyle ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy After reporters pressed Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, on Tuesday about why, if he really believed there was widespread vote fraud, the president did not order an investigation, Mr. Trump on Wednesday morning blasted out a post saying he would do just that. More than any president before him, Mr. Trump is a creature of television and social media, a reality show star obsessed with Nielsen ratings who vaulted himself to the highest office in the land on the back of a robust Twitter account. President Lyndon B. Johnson kept three televisions in the Oval Office so he could watch all three network nightly news broadcasts at the same time. But with the advent of the 24-hour cable television era, other presidents have made a point of shielding themselves from the nonstop chatter to avoid becoming too reactive. President George W. Bush always said he avoided watching television news. (\u201cSorry,\u201d he would tell television correspondents with a sheepish grin.) Mr. Obama opted instead for ESPN\u2019s \u201cSportsCenter\u201d late at night. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, while not much of a reader, is a voracious consumer of broadcast and social media, and it clearly guides his actions. Examples abound. Advertisement Continue reading the main story One morning in November after the election as he was preparing to become president, Fox News aired a segment at 6:25 a.m. on college students burning the American flag. At 6:55 a.m., Mr. Trump wrote : \u201cNobody should be allowed to burn the American flag \u2013 if they do, there must be consequences \u2013 perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\u201d Similarly, posts about the high cost of a new Air Force One and the F-35 fighter jet came soon after news reports rather than policy briefings. So far at least, Mr. Trump has shown that he does not believe in the restraints other presidents put on themselves. After the Dow Jones industrial average surpassed the 20,000 mark on Wednesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s staff-managed official Twitter account sent out a message declaring it \u201cGreat!\u201d even though other presidents made it a policy not to comment on daily market gyrations. The Chicago declaration provided a case in point. A threat to send federal forces into one of the nation\u2019s largest cities \u2014 Mr. Trump did not specify whether he meant the National Guard, the F.B.I. or any other agency \u2014 is usually not one issued lightly. During Hurricane Katrina , Mr. Bush spent crucial days privately debating with aides whether to take over the National Guard in Louisiana. Mr. Trump sees little need for such deliberations before weighing in. This is, as he put it in his Inaugural Address, \u201cthe hour of action.\u201d Whether the action will now follow the words remains uncertain less than a week into his presidency. Reporting was contributed by Michael D. Shear in Washington and Maggie Haberman in New York. ",

Some experts now asses that North Korea's capabilities may have been underestimated. \"Pyongyang is much further along in their missile development than most people realize,\" said Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the U.S.-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California, told Reuters earlier this month. Choe claimed that North Korea viewed the regular joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises as a provocation that was spurring the regime to enhance its nuclear weapons capability. Related: North Korea Warns It Would Use Nuclear Weapons First If Threatened \"Imagine if our troops went to Canada and Mexico to carry out a nuclear exercise aimed at invading the U.S., what kind of response would you expect from the American people?\" he said. \"As long as the U.S. conducts these joint military exercises we will increase our nuclear deterrent forces and our preemptive strike forces.\" Asked about the only policy the President Donald Trump's administration had so far announced regarding North Korea \u2014 the establishment of a state-of-the-art anti-missile defense system to counter the threat from both that country and Iran, Choe said: \"It's a provocation. If the U.S. wants to develop the system, it should not use our country as an issue or an excuse. The U.S. is intentionally aggravating the tensions on the Korean peninsula in order to realize its ambition of dominating Asia.\" North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 He did, however, sound some conciliatory notes on relations with the U.S., saying: \"Our supreme leader Kim Jong Un said even though it has been hostile to us in the past, if the U.S. becomes friendlier to us we will develop that relationship.\" Asked if he welcomed Trump's remark that he would be prepared to meet Kim, the official said \"we will wait and see the difference between his campaign rhetoric and his policy as President.\" Related: Analysis: What Will Trump Do About North Korea's Kim Jong Un? Speaking further about the U.S.'s new leader, Choe said: \"We're not worried who is president, but whoever is president should recognize that North Korea is a nuclear power and a military giant. We hope the new president will recognize that position and will drop America's hostile policy towards our country. He would be well advised to secure a new way of thinking.\" North Korea's nuclear activities have prompted the international community to impose a stringent sanctions regime on Pyongyang via the United Nations, targeting the country's banking, travel and trade, as well as access to foreign-made military equipment. \"Sanctions aren't working. They will not stop our nuclear program,\" Choe told NBC News. In January last year, Pyongyang offered to end its nuclear tests, in exchange for a peace treaty with the U.S. to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war and a halt to the annual U.S.-led military exercises in the region. State Department officials said that the U.S. rejected the proposal, as the North Koreans refused to take steps to curb its nuclear arsenal. Bill Neely ",

    "text": "Jan 25 2017, 4:33 pm ET Electrical Contractor Suing Trump Hotel for Unpaid $2 Million Bill by Ari Melber and Corky Siemaszko Share advertisement A Maryland-based electrical contractor claims they worked \"nonstop\" to get President Trump's new Washington hotel ready in time for a televised campaign stop in September \u2014 and then got stiffed on the bill. AES Electrical, which is also known as Freestate Electrical, has filed suit in Washington D.C.'s Superior Court to recoup the $2,075,731.61 it claims it is still owed for helping turn the Old Post Office into the luxury Trump International Hotel. Vehicles participating in an inaugural parade rehearsal pass by the Trump Internationa Hotel, January 15, 2017 in Washington, DC. On January 20 President-elect Donald Trump with be sworn in as the nation's 45th president. Mark Wilson / Getty Images In addition to the Trump Organization, it names Trump's contractor, Lend Lease of New York, in the suit. Freestate states in court papers that it began working on the project on Sept. 29, 2014 and was ordered to \"accelerate work\" last fall. The reason? \"To permit Mr. Trump's nationally televised campaign event from the Hotel on September 16, 2016, which was to honor U.S. veterans,\" the papers state. Also, the Trump hotel had already started booking \"paid events\" and rooms for a \" soft opening \" on Sept. 12. To get the work done on time, the company claims, \"required Freestate's crews to work nonstop, seven days per week, 10 to 14 hours per day, for nearly 50 consecutive days, prior to the 'soft opening,' at significant additional cost and expense for which Freestate expected payment.\" Freestate claims it continued to work at the same pace to ensure the hotel was ready for its \"grand opening\" on Oct. 26. \"The 'grand opening' of the Trump Hotel by this day, was also a nationally covered event, which was planned just prior to the U.S. presidential election,\" the suit states. \"Although Mr. Trump's Hotel has now been opened and has operated for business since September 2016, and despite the fact that Mr. Trump was successfully elected as the next U.S. President, Trump refuses to pay the sums due for the account of work of subcontractors, like Freestate.\" Freestate, which states in the suit that it has thus far been paid $15,130,267.39, said that when it submitted the bill for the extra costs, the Trump organization offered to pay just a third of the bill. A spokesman for Freestate, which employs union electricians, did not immediately return a phone call from NBC to elaborate on the lawsuit, which was filed last Thursday \u2014 a day before Trump's inauguration. Workers at the new Trump International Hotel watch as US President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump ride in their limousine during the Inaugural Parade after taking the oath of office as the 45th President of the United States in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2017. Trump won the 08 November 2016 election to become the next US President. ERIK S. LESSER / EPA A spokesperson for the Trump Organization responded to the lawsuit with the following statement: \"In developments of this scale and complexity the filing of nominal liens at the conclusion of construction is not uncommon as part of the close out process. In the case of Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C., the Trump Organization has invested over $200 million dollars into the redevelopment of the historic Old Post Office and is incredibly proud of what is now considered to be one the most iconic hotels anywhere in the country.\" The White House insists that Trump himself has divested himself from his companies and has turned over management of his empire to his sons. This is not the first time the Trump organization has been accused of pressuring contractors to accept reduced payments on projects \u2014 or flat out failing to pay workers what they are owed. USA Today and other news organizations have reported that Trump and his companies have been hit with more than 3,500 lawsuits for non-payment of bills or wages over the past three decades. Also, Trump companies have been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005, the paper reported. Perhaps the most infamous example were the undocumented Polish workers who were hired to build Trump's glitzy home, Trump Tower in Manhattan. They went on strike when they weren't paid, triggering a multi-year legal battle that ended with a settlement. Trump denied doing anything wrong, and the Polish workers never got a nickel from the settlement. Ari Melber ",

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel says the help is welcome. USA TODAY NETWORK Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks during a press conference on Wednesday about President Trump's suggestion a day earlier that he may order federal intervention to help stem violence in Chicago. (Photo: Matt Marton, AP) CHICAGO \u2014 In the face of scathing criticism and threats of a federal intervention from President Trump, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Wednesday he would welcome greater federal involvement \u2013 and dollars \u2013 to help\u00a0solve\u00a0Chicago\u2019s surge in violence. Emanuel\u2019s comments came a day after Trump warned that if Chicago does not stem the violence that has plagued the city, he stands ready to call for federal intervention. \u201cChicago, like other cities that are dealing with gun violence, want to\u00a0partner\u00a0with federal law enforcement entities in a more significant way than we are\u00a0today\u2014whether that\u2019s the FBI, the DEA, and the ATF,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cI still firmly believe that part of that solution is resources to police and resources that can come in technology and that space. Over the years, the federal government when it comes to after school (programs), summer jobs and investment in kids has walked away, while we\u2019ve had to step up and take responsibility.\u201d Chicago recorded 762 murders and 4,300 shooting victims in 2016 \u2014 the deadliest in nearly two decades for the city. The nation\u2019s third largest city is now off to a bloody start in 2017. The city had\u00a0recorded\u00a0 at least 42 murders\u00a0 through Monday \u2014 compared to 34 murders at\u00a0the same time last year. Trump, fed up with Chicago 'carnage,' threatens to send Feds During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly slammed Chicago and the mayor over the surge in crime, and took aim again from his Twitter account on Tuesday evening. \u201cIf Chicago doesn't fix the horrible \u2018carnage\u2019 going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\u201d Trump wrote on his personal Twitter account in his latest salvo. How Trump can defund 'sanctuary cities' protecting undocumented immigrants On Wednesday, the White House offered spare\u00a0details on what a potential federal intervention might look like. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the latest comments were spurred by the president's concern over\u00a0\"turning on the television and seeing Americans get killed by shootings.\" \"There\u2019s no one thing,\" Spicer said.\u00a0\"There can be aid\u00a0that can be, if it was requested up through the governor, through the proper channels, that the federal government can provide (to)\u00a0law enforcement...There\u2019s other aid\u00a0that can be extended as well, either through the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office or other means that will ensure that the people of Chicago have the resources to feel safe.\" Both Emanuel\u00a0and members of Chicago's city council said dispatching National Guard troops to the streets of Chicago would be inappropriate and they would oppose such a move. Emanuel noted that a majority of the guns recovered from the streets of Chicago are illegally purchased by repeat offenders who come to Chicago from Indiana, Mississippi and Wisconsin. \u201cThe federal entities are set up to deal with that, and they do,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cWe\u2019d like an increase in that partnership.\u201d Trump and Emanuel are also at odds over Chicago\u2019s status as a so-called sanctuary city, one of dozens of cities across the U.S. that in some way limits cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents. Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order directing the government to identify federal money it can withhold to punish sanctuary cities. Emanuel said he was waiting to read Trump\u2019s order. But the mayor was not ready to flinch. \u201cI want to be clear,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay a sanctuary city.\u201d The mayor, however, did not respond to questions from reporters about\u00a0how Chicago would manage to weather a slashing of federal funding. How Trump can defund 'sanctuary cities' protecting undocumented immigrants Trump met with Emanuel in New York during the transition. The president expressed concern to the mayor about the violence and his desire to work with Emanuel to find solutions, Spicer said. But Spicer added, thus far, there\u2019s been no follow up from the mayor. Emanuel, however, said he had a private meeting with Vice President Pence\u00a0in the days\u00a0before he was inaugurated last week. The two spoke about the problems of gangs and violence in Chicago, Emanuel said. Several members of the Chicago city council also called on Trump to back up his social media rhetoric with funding. A disproportionate amount of the violence in the city occurs in a few neighborhoods on Chicago\u2019s South and West Sides, predominantly black and Latino enclaves where poverty is a persistent problem. Alderman Sophia King, who represents a ward on the city\u2019s South Side, said if Trump is going to have the federal government intervene, \u201che better come with a big bag. \u201c \u201cWe welcome the federal government, but he needs to come with money for jobs, money for neighborhood schools, money for economic development in these communities and then we can address the disparity,\u201d King said. \u201cThere is a direct correlation between poverty and crime.\u201d Other council members were more hostile to Trump\u2019s suggestion that he stands ready for federal intervention. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean the resources of the federal government coming in to create jobs on the South or West Side of Chicago, to create jobs for people of color, to take the guns out of people\u2019s hands and put them to work,\u201d said Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa of Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cYou know what he meant. He meant locking up more black and brown folks, just like Republicans, right-wingers, have always done.\u201d Contributing: Gregory Korte and Donovan Slack in Washington Follow USA TODAY Chicago correspondent\u00a0Aamer Madhani on Twitter:\u00a0 @AamerISmad 4260 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 195 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ku9xOo NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "Trump Blocks Syrian Refugees and Orders Mexican Border Wall to Be Built By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS Video Trump Orders Border Wall With Mexico President Trump addressed the Department of Homeland Security, discussing his most recent executive order calling for the construction of a border wall at the border between the United States and Mexico. By THE NEW YORK TIMES on Publish Date January 25, 2017. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday began a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ordering the immediate construction of a border wall with Mexico and aggressive efforts to find and deport unauthorized immigrants. He planned additional actions to cut back on legal immigration, including barring Syrian refugees from entering the United States. At the headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Trump signed a pair of executive orders that paved the way for a border wall and called for a newly expanded force to sweep up immigrants who are in the country illegally. He revived programs that allow the federal government to work with local and state law enforcement agencies to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and to share information to help track and deport them. He also planned to clamp down on legal immigration in another action expected as early as Thursday. An eight-page draft of that executive order, obtained by The New York Times, would indefinitely block Syrian refugees from entering the United States and bar all refugees from the rest of the world for at least 120 days. When the refugee program resumes, it would be much smaller, with the total number of refugees resettled in the United States this year more than halved, to 50,000 from 110,000. It would also suspend any immigration for at least 30 days from a number of predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 while the government toughened its already stringent screening procedures to weed out potential terrorists. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Taken together, the moves would turn the full weight of the federal government to fortifying the United States border, rounding up some of the 11 million people who are in the country illegally and targeting refugees, who are often among the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. It is an aggressive use of presidential power that follows through on the nationalistic vision Mr. Trump presented during his presidential campaign. \u201cA nation without borders is not a nation,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday, where he signed the orders alongside the newly sworn in secretary, John F. Kelly. \u201cBeginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders.\u201d The plans are a sharp break with former President Barack Obama\u2019s approach and what was once a bipartisan consensus to devise a path to citizenship for some of the nation\u2019s illegal immigrants. Mr. Obama, however, angered many immigrant groups for deporting millions of unauthorized workers, largely during his first term. But Mr. Trump, whose campaign rallies were filled with chants from his supporters of \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d has vowed to go much further. He has often described unauthorized immigrants as criminals who must be found and forcibly removed from the United States, as he did again on Wednesday. OPEN Document \u201cWe are going to get the bad ones out \u2014 the criminals and the drug dealers and gangs and gang members,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe day is over when they can stay in our country and wreak havoc. We are going to get them out, and we are going to get them out fast.\u201d The president had invited the families of people killed by unauthorized immigrants to watch him sign the orders alongside Homeland Security employees, and he asked each of them to stand in turn, telling of the deaths of their relatives that he said had inspired his policies. \u201cWe hear you, we see you, and you will never, ever be ignored again,\u201d Mr. Trump said, contending that they had been \u201cvictimized by open borders.\u201d The immigration orders drew furious condemnation from civil rights and religious groups as well as immigrant advocacy organizations. The groups described them as meanspirited, counterproductive and expensive and said the new policies would raise constitutional concerns while undermining the American tradition of welcoming people from around the world. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThey\u2019re setting out to unleash this deportation force on steroids, and local police will be able to run wild, so we\u2019re tremendously concerned about the impact that could have on immigrants and families across the country,\u201d said Joanne Lin, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cAfter today\u2019s announcement, the fear quotient is going to go up exponentially.\u201d Lynn Tramonte, the deputy director of America\u2019s Voice Education Fund, an immigration advocacy group, said Mr. Trump was \u201c wasting no time taking a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty .\u201d She called the orders \u201ca dramatic, radical and extreme assault on immigrants and the values of our country.\u201d Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, who had planned to travel to Washington next week to meet with Mr. Trump, let it be known that he was considering cancel ing his trip , senior Mexican officials said. Mr. Trump has claimed that Mexico would ultimately pay for the wall, but officials there have repeatedly insisted they have no intention of doing so. But conservative organizations in the United States and some Republican lawmakers praised Mr. Trump\u2019s moves, saying they would usher in overdue enforcement of crucial homeland security laws that Mr. Obama had refused to carry out. OPEN Graphic \u201cThis looks like a return to enforcing the immigration laws, which is something that President Obama strayed from and has not been prioritized in a very long time,\u201d said Tommy Binion, the director of policy outreach at the conservative-aligned Heritage Foundation. \u201cTo have President Trump focus on the problems immigration is bringing us as a nation is a relief. Finally, we have a government that recognizes the tragedies that we\u2019re facing.\u201d Mr. Trump will not be able to accomplish the goals laid out in the immigration orders by himself. Congress would have to appropriate new funding for the construction of a wall, which some have estimated could cost tens of billions of dollars. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump directed federal agencies to use existing funds as a start to the wall and formally called for the hiring of an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 10,000 additional immigration officers. The order would threaten the nation\u2019s roughly three dozen sanctuary cities \u2014 jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal authorities seeking to detain unauthorized immigrants \u2014 with losing federal grant money if they do not comply with such requests. At the same time, Mr. Trump is reviving a program called Secure Communities, ended by the Obama administration, in which federal officials use digital fingerprints shared by local law enforcement departments to find and deport immigrants who commit crimes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The provisions are chilling to many immigration advocates, who argued they could sweep up unauthorized immigrants beyond the criminals Mr. Trump says he wants to target. Among those listed as priorities for removal are those who have \u201cengaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency,\u201d which would essentially include any undocumented worker who has signed an employment agreement in the United States. The order also includes a section that directs federal agencies to adjust their privacy policies to exclude unauthorized immigrants, in effect allowing the sharing of their personal identifying information, which could be used to track and apprehend them. \u201cWith today\u2019s sweeping and constitutionally suspect executive actions, the president is turning his back on both our history and our values as a proud nation of immigrants,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. \u201cWasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall Mexico will never pay for, and punishing cities that do not want their local police forces forced to serve as President Trump\u2019s deportation dragnet does nothing to fix our immigration system or keep Americans safe.\u201d The order on refugees is in line with a Muslim ban that Mr. Trump proposed during the campaign, though it does not single out any particular religion. It orders the secretary of state and the secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize those who are persecuted members of religious minorities, essentially ensuring that Christians living in predominantly Muslim countries would be at the top of the list. \u201cIn order to protect Americans,\u201d the order states, \u201cwe must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward our country and its founding principles.\u201d It says that for the time being, admitting anyone from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d Azam Ahmed contributed reporting from Mexico City.

A 28-year-old California woman who was reported missing over the weekend was found alive Wednesday walking alongside a freeway, officials said.\u00a0 Laura Lynne Stacy was last seen Sunday morning leaving her Hollywood Hills apartment. A day later, her cellphone was found in a puddle of water about 30 miles away at Golden Valley Park in Santa Clarita. Her vehicle -- with Colorado license plates -- was discovered Tuesday night with its doors locked along the side of a highway in a remote desert area of Lancaster, Calif. Officers who were responding to the area Wednesday to help look for Stacy spotted her walking along the 14 Freeway nearly 60 miles from her home, police told FOX 11 Los Angeles .\u00a0 Officials told FOX 11 she was taken to the hospital out of precaution, and was going to be reunited with her family.

A law enforcement source told Fox News there were no \"obvious signs of foul play\" at the scene but said forensic testing is being conducted on the vehicle. Stacy, who works in real estate and enjoys photography, had moved two months ago to Los Angeles from her home in Denver. The woman's mother told Fox News on Wednesday that she believes her daughter visited\u00a0Golden Valley Park to take photographs. While there, she said she thinks her daughter dropped her cellphone and was unable to use its GPS device when driving home. Expand / Contract Laura Lynne Stacy Marcy Stacy said she believes her daughter got lost in bad weather conditions and pulled over along the side of the road. A blanket and some food were found inside the vehicle, Stacy said, adding that police have also searched area hospitals. Expand / Contract Laura Lynne Stacy \"I think she got lost when she was driving home,\" Stacy told Fox News. \"You can tell she was in the car for awhile.\" \"We think she ran out of gas and started walking,\" she said. Authorities on Wednesday conducted searches near Lancaster with helicopters and dogs for any sign of her. Stacy's roommate was the last person to see her at their apartment on Sunday. At around 5 a.m. Monday morning, Stacy's mother said she received a text from her daughter\u2019s cellphone. But the message came from a stranger who reported finding the phone on the ground at Golden Valley Park -- about 30 miles from Stacy's apartment. The phone was later turned in to the\u00a0Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Station. Fox News' Cristina Corbin contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Birna Brjansdottir, 20, went missing on Jan. 14 after a night out with friends. She was last seen on surveillance footage around 5am wondering the streets alone and buying a kebab. Hours before her body was discovered, her shoes were found earlier at a nearby town called Hafnarfjordur. Gunnar Runar Sveinejornsson, spokesman for the Reykjavik Metropolitan Police, said her body was found near the capital after a week-long search.\u00a0 Brjansdottir\u2019s close friend Matthildur Soffia Jonsdottir posted a message on Facebook on Tuesday, expressing her grief and remembering the young woman as \u201cone of the best people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI loved her and how she looked at life,\u201d Jonsdottir said. \u201cI\u2019m angry...

Eddie Johnson on Jan. 13, 2017, announcing the Department of Justice report on Chicago policing. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson on Jan. 13, 2017, announcing the Department of Justice report on Chicago policing. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The city was abuzz Wednesday with talk of President Donald Trump 's Twitter threat to \"send in the Feds!\" to deal with Chicago's shooting problem. But before Trump sends in a phalanx of soldiers, G-men or federal eggheads, shouldn't he call on the unnamed \"top police officer\" whom he said in August could solve the city's crime problem \"within one week\"? Trump said on Bill O'Reilly's Fox News show on Aug. 22 that he'd met the mysterious supercop in Chicago and that he \"believed him 100 percent\" when the cop said he could stop serious crime within seven days by getting tough. Yet despite Trump's assertion to O'Reilly that he had \"sent his name in and I said you probably should hire this guy,\" neither the Police Department nor Mayor Rahm Emanuel received the officer's name from Trump, city officials said. White House officials did not respond Wednesday morning to questions about who the officer is, whether Trump still maintains he has shared his name with Chicago officials, or whether Trump remains in contact with the officer, if he in fact exists. Donald Trump proposed his solution if Chicago can't reduce the violence. \"I will send in the Feds!\"... The roots of Chicago's gun violence epidemic are so deep and multifaceted that experts have long said law enforcement alone can't solve it. But in 24 characters of a tweet sent Tuesday night, President Donald Trump proposed his solution if Chicago can't reduce the violence. \"I will send in the Feds!\"... (Jason Meisner, Annie Sweeney and Jeremy Gorner) But asked about Trump's vague threat to \"send in the Feds!\" at a news conference, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters the president will \"hopefully get a dialogue started with Mayor (Rahm) Emanuel to try to figure out what a path forward can be so that we come up with a plan that can keep the people of Chicago safe,\" a somewhat more conciliatory tone than that offered by the president himself. Chicago police in August said that nobody in \"senior command\" with the department had spoken to Trump, leaving the identity of the \"top police officer\" an unsolved riddle. Trump's staff at the time said Trump had not necessarily meant that the officer was in senior command, only that he was \"capable, smart and talented.\" Former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy \u2014 who has known Trump since his time in New York, and was praised in 2015 by Trump as \"a phenomenal guy\" who \"could stop this if we allowed him to stop it\" \u2014 in September angrily denied he was Trump's mole. With the prospect of soldiers on the streets of Chicago, it's surely time for the hero officer to unmask himself. Call us, Supercop! ",

Markus Schreiber/AP hide caption toggle caption Markus Schreiber/AP German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet says it is scrapping the controversial law against insulting foreign heads of state. Markus Schreiber/AP Germany's cabinet says it is scrapping a controversial and little-used law that makes it a criminal offense to insult foreign heads of state, effective Jan. 1, 2018. Justice Minister Heiko Mass said the law is \"obsolete and unnecessary,\" Deutsche Welle reported . He said the concept \"dates back to a long-gone era, it no longer belongs in our criminal law.\" Germany Drops Investigation Of Comic Whose Poem Insulted Turkey's Leader Mass added that foreign heads of state could still pursue libel and defamation cases \"but no more or less so than any other person,\" according to the broadcaster. Last year, the law was invoked in a controversial case against comedian Jan Boehmermann because he read an obscene poem on television criticizing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as The Two-Way reported : \"The controversy actually began because of a completely different video clip mocking Erdogan. That music video, released on the German comedy program Extra3, prompted Turkey to summon the German ambassador. \"In the wake of the first controversy, Boehmermann appeared on German television and read his crude poem, which 'said Erdogan kicks Kurds, smacks Christians, all while watching child pornography,' as we have reported. There were also references to bestiality. \"At the time, Boehmermann said that his poem was meant to be an example of insults that wouldn't be allowed in Germany, rather than to represent his own personal opinion about Erdogan.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would allow the investigation against Boehmermann to move forward in April, after a formal request from Turkey. The investigation was dropped in October for lack of evidence . Article continues after sponsorship Merkel faced widespread criticism from people who saw the case as an attack on freedom of speech. As we reported, it happened shortly after Germany struck a deal with Turkey aimed at stemming the flow of migrants into the E.U. Some critics argued that the timing had an impact on Merkel's decision to pursue the case back in April. And even as Merkel allowed the investigation to proceed, she told reporters that she planned to \"draft a proposal to replace the current law,\" as Deutsche Welle reported at the time. This is what the law in the German Criminal Code actually said: \"Whosoever insults a foreign head of state, or, with respect to his position, a member of a foreign government who is in Germany in his official capacity, or a head of a foreign diplomatic mission who is accredited in the Federal territory shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three years or a fine, in case of a slanderous insult to imprisonment from three months to five years.\" Erdogan is still engaged in a civil law dispute against Boehmermann, Reuters reported. \"A district court in Hamburg will decide on Erdogan's action for an injunction on Feb. 10.\" ",

Gary Byrne, who guarded President Clinton and the Oval Office during a 12-year stint with the Secret Service, told Fox News Special Agent Kerry O\u2019Grady\u2019s revelation on Facebook was astonishing. Expand / Contract \u201cIt is unheard of and unbelievable that someone at her level would comment publicly on being unwilling to protect the president,\u201d said Byrne, author of \u201cCrisis of Character,\u201d a book that came out during the presidential campaign that was highly critical of Hillary Clinton. \u201cEveryone has their own personal political opinions, but this job is not personal. You take an oath to the country, not the person. You are protecting the office, and what makes the country great.\u201d Dan Emmett, a retired Secret Service agent and author of \u201cWithin Arms Length\u201d and \u201cI Am a Secret Service Agent,\u201d said, \"In my view, O'Grady can no longer function with any degree of credibility as an agent and\u00a0should retire or be dismissed by the Secret Service.\" He added, \u201cHer stated\u00a0refusal or unwillingness to do what all Secret Service agents have been willing and expected to do since 1902 when the Secret Service began protecting presidents presents the worst possible example for her agents as well as all young agents Service wide. She has at this point rendered herself completely irrelevant as an agent. Few will be willing\u00a0to work for her or with her.\" The Secret Service is reportedly \"taking appropriate action\" after news broke that O\u2019Grady had made the comments in an October Facebook post. The agency did not say if O\u2019Grady, who is in charge of the Denver office, could be disciplined or even fired, but her comments may be in violation of The Hatch Act. That 1939 law bars certain federal employees from engaging in political activity to promote fairness and nonpartisanship within the workplace. The Secret Service is among the agencies affected by the Hatch Act. \"As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act,\u201d O\u2019Grady wrote. \u201cSo I keep quiet and skirt the median. To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides. But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her.\" O'Grady told the Washington Examiner that she took down the posts after two or three days and that she would protect the president. \"It was an internal struggle for me but as soon as I put it up, I thought it was not the sentiment that I needed to share because I care very deeply about the mission,\" she said. Byrne said simply retracting the statement is not enough. \u201cAt her level, she is special agent in charge of Denver, she has a couple hundred people working under her including agents, technicians, and officers,\u201d he said. \u201cHer job is to run the office, but to provide the manpower if the President comes to Colorado. \u00a0If she made these comments just to her friends, that is personal. But if you state that publicly, like she did on Facebook, she should be removed from the position. \u201cI cannot tell you how bad that is,\u201d he added.

Bill Kintner on Legislature floor in undated photo</p> Close KMTV LINCOLN, Neb. -- A Nebraska state senator with a history of questionable online behavior could become the first lawmaker to get expelled from the Legislature in recent history if he doesn\u2019t resign. Lawmakers could vote Wednesday to remove State Sen. Bill Kintner, of Papillion, from office. Kintner has scheduled a press conference before the vote to announce his plans. Kintner has faced criticism for a pattern of behavior that includes cybersex on a state computer and retweeting a joke that implied Women\u2019s March protesters are too unattractive to sexually assault. The legislature\u2019s speaker, State Sen. Jim Scheer, says he\u2019s confident lawmakers have enough votes to expel Kintner, but debate over the matter could delay the vote. Women's March, in Washington and around the world State Sen. Bill Krist put together a resolution to expel Kintner if he doesn\u2019t quit on his own, reports CBS Omaha affiliate KMTV . \u201cWe all have a line that we draw in the sand and this is what we will and will not do. I think most of them have been put beyond that line by Senator Kintner and there\u2019s no turning back at this point,\u201d Sen. Krist explained to the station. Once the uproar over the Women\u2019s March retweet began, Kintner deleted his Twitter account, KMTVF reports. Kintner says people were taking the tweet out of context.\u00a0 KMTV reports the latest controversy comes after Kintner admitted using a state computer to engage in cyber-sex with a woman who wasn\u2019t his wife last year. Kintner paid a $1,000 fine and also ignored calls for his resignation. Kintner was elected in 2012 in a largely rural and suburban district south of Omaha. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The mayor's comments came after President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening took to Twitter to suggest he would \"send in the Feds!\" if Chicago doesn't \"fix the horrible 'carnage' going on.\" The president's tweet, however, did not specify what form that could take. At a Wednesday press briefing, White House spokesman Sean Spicer didn't respond directly when asked whether Trump was talking about deploying National Guard troops to Chicago. \"There's no one thing,\" Spicer said. \"There can be aid, if it was requested up through the governor through the proper channels that the federal government can provide on a law enforcement basis. But there's other aid that can be extended as well through the U.S. attorney's office or other means that will ensure the people of Chicago have the resources to feel safe. That's what he means. And part of it is that no American, whether or not you live in Chicago or Nebraska, shouldn't feel like you can walk down the streets of a city in this country and fear for your life. And I think too often that's happening in Chicago.\" Spicer: No American should fear for life walking down the street White house spokesman Sean Spicer on how the Trump administration can help curb the violence in Chicago. Jan. 25, 2017. (The White House) White house spokesman Sean Spicer on how the Trump administration can help curb the violence in Chicago. Jan. 25, 2017. (The White House) See more videos At City Hall , Emanuel said the National Guard \"has nothing to do with public safety\" and that he was \"against it, straight up.\" \"The place you want \u2014 if it comes to safety and security when dealing with gangs and guns \u2014 you want the federal resources that are set up to deal with that,\" Emanuel said while speaking to reporters at a news conference that included more national media outlets than usual in the wake of the Trump tweet. \"That is the ATF, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. That is DEA, Drug Enforcement Agency. That is FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigations.\" Spicer indicated Trump was waiting for Emanuel to ask for help dealing with Chicago crime, referencing a meeting the two had in New York prior to Trump's inauguration. \"I think the president-elect at the time extended his support to Mayor Emanuel to say that the resources of the federal government are here for you,\" Spicer said. \"To the best of my knowledge, that return call for help has not occurred.\" Spicer: Rahm has not returned Trump's call White House spokesperson said in press briefing Jan. 25, 2017, he believed\u00a0Rahm Emaunel has not yet returned President Trump's phone call. (White House) White House spokesperson said in press briefing Jan. 25, 2017, he believed\u00a0Rahm Emaunel has not yet returned President Trump's phone call. (White House) See more videos Emanuel on Wednesday said he talked with Trump during that early December meeting about the kind of federal help Chicago would like to receive, though he did not offer specifics on what he asked for. \"I've been very clear about what I think we need to do, and I think you can say this, and I'm saying it correctly: I'm not a shy person,\" he said. \"But I look forward to working with the new administration on expanding what exists today. We have a partnership. There are resources.\" Emanuel repeatedly has pointed out that though Chicago has received much of Trump's public crime-fighting focus, other American cities are statistically more violent and also seeing spikes in the number of shootings. The mayor brushed off a question Wednesday about why the president is so fixated on Chicago. \"Look, that's not for me to answer. You should ask your colleagues out in Washington,\" he said. \"Here's the thing: You want to focus on Chicago? OK. I'm going to focus on Chicago.\" Aldermen reacted cautiously to the presidential tweet, saying the city could use more federal money and assistance but that armed troops patrolling the streets would be a mistake. \"I don't think we need troops in the city,\" said Ald. Pat Dowell , 3rd. \"Nobody wants to be subject to a curfew, home-to-home searches, cordoning off neighborhoods. I think we need more investment in terms of jobs, investment in our schools.\" South Side Ald. Toni Foulkes said sending National Guard units into the city's African-American neighborhoods would worsen conditions in those communities, where there is already a distrust of law enforcement. \"When the National Guard gets involved, you end up with curfews, militarization of neighborhoods,\" said Foulkes, 16th, who represents parts of Englewood, West Englewood, Chicago Lawn and Gage Park. \"And especially in places like Englewood, neighborhoods where residents already feel like there's a racial basis to some of these decisions, that will not help matters.\" Cardinal Blase Cupich, who was at City Hall to be honored for his recent elevation to cardinal, said the situation is \"more complex\" than one that can be dealt with simply by posting federal troops on Chicago streets. \"The problem is surely much more complex than that type of a solution,\" he said. \"I surely would welcome, and I think a lot of people would welcome, assistance on a multilevel basis, simply because the problem is not simple. It is complex and it can be improved if we all pull together.\" Emanuel is in a tough spot. With Chicago's ongoing crime problems eroding local trust in his administration and garnering so much national attention from Trump and others, it could be difficult for the mayor to reject outright offers of help. But he might not want to be seen as turning over crime fighting to federal officials. And the mayor is trying desperately to increase some residents' trust in law enforcement that was badly hurt by the Laquan McDonald police shooting and other incidents in the past year, a process he said the National Guard would undermine.

Trump cabinet nominee forced to compare inauguration crowd sizes at hearing Gallup released a survey Tuesday showing that 48 percent of Americans believed that the U.S. would be better off in 2020, compared to 46 percent that thought the country would be worse off after four years. However, there\u2019s a deep partisan divide when it comes to those numbers: 85 percent of Republicans believe that the U.S. would be improved after four years. Just 14 percent of Democrats believed that. On the other hand, 79 percent of Democrats think the state of the nation will deteriorate, compared to 11 percent of Republicans. Independents, in comparison, are cleaved in two: Forty-four percent believe the U.S. will be better, 48 percent say it will be worse.\u00a0 Americans are dramatically less optimistic about Mr. Trump\u2019s first term than they were ahead of former President Obama\u2019s first days in office . In January of 2009, just over 7 in 10 Americans believed the nation would be better off four years after Obama became president.\u00a0 The numbers for Mr. Trump, who lost the popular vote by more than 2 million ballots, hew closer to those of former President George W. Bush, who also lost the popular vote in 2000. In January of 2001, about 46 percent of Americans had a positive view of how the country would turn out, compared to 42 percent that said they thought the country would be worse off. The Gallup poll was conducted Jan. 4-8 with a sample of 1,032 adults. The margin of error was four percentage points. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Photo: Christian Torres, AP) President Trump on Wednesday took the first step toward fulfilling his campaign promise of building a \"great wall\" along the southwest border. Getting it finished, however, will take a lot of help from Congress. During a speech at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump said his administration would \"begin immediate construction of a border wall,\" a campaign pledge so popular with his supporters that they chanted \"Build that wall\" at rallies. Earlier in the day, Trump told ABC News that the planning of the wall had begun, but construction could would start in several months. \"So badly needed,\" Trump told a room full of DHS employees. \"This will also help Mexico by deterring illegal immigration from Central America and by disrupting violent cartel networks.\" Here's a look at some of the basics behind the border wall. Where does it stand now? The U.S. \"border wall\"\u00a0is really a collection of walls, fences and other barriers that currently cover\u00a0652 miles of the 1,954-mile border with Mexico,\u00a0 according to the Government Accountability Office . The wall is strongest along parts of the border\u00a0that have large populations on both sides, such as San Diego and Tijuana. Each city runs right up to the border, so the Department of Homeland Security has built double and triple layers of fencing for 14 miles starting at\u00a0the Pacific Ocean and heading east. In other, more desolate parts of the border, there are only single fences or a variety of barriers, including iron vehicle barriers that people can easily walk past. Most areas have no fencing, but some are nearly impossible to cross, from the widest sections of the Rio Grande to deep canyons and treacherous mountains. CLOSE x Share A look at the socioeconomic and environmental impact of a 2,000-mile long wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. How much could it cost to finish? Predictions have varied widely, but it will be expensive. Trump took his own stab at the figure\u00a0in February,\u00a0 telling MSNBC \u00a0he could finish the wall for $8 billion. But most other estimates are far higher. In 2015, Border Patrol officials said during a Senate hearing that the current 652 miles of wall had cost $2.3 billion. But that does not include increased costs for building across more difficult terrain or building the wall higher, as Trump has said he would do. The\u00a0Bernstein Research\u00a0group\u00a0 conducted a study \u00a0in July and estimated the total costs to be between $15 and $25 billion. Could Trump finish the wall himself? It's possible that Trump could kick-start some construction on his own. When Congress passed the\u00a0Secure Fence Act\u00a0of 2000, it approved\u00a0up to 700 miles of fencing. With 652 miles currently built, that means Trump could try and build the remaining miles on his own. \"At this point, his goal was to get the project started as quickly as possible using existing funds and resources that the department currently has,\" Spicer said Wednesday. But to build the additional 1,200 miles, he would need funding from Congress. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday that the administration is already working with Congress on an \"appropriation schedule\" to secure funding for the remainder of the wall. GOP leaders in both chambers have said they would help Trump secure the border, but have not committed to funding the billions Trump needs. Can he make Mexico pay for it? Trump has repeatedly said that he would get Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall. \"Absolutely, 100%\" he told ABC News. Former Mexican President\u00a0Vicente Fox Quesada\u00a0took to Twitter again Wednesday to say the country won't pay for that \"expletive\" wall. Trump's plan calls for Mexico to pay through a combination of factors, including increased fees and taxes to cross the southwest border, and withholding remittances that Mexican nationals in the U.S. send back to their families in Mexico. He could need some help from Congress there to create a legal mechanism to withhold that much money. The plan could also face legal challenges. Trump introduced a new possibility on Wednesday. An executive order he signed\u00a0instructed all executive branch agencies to identify all federal assistance they sent to Mexico over the past five years. That includes all \"bilateral and multinational development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid and military aid.\" The agencies are required to submit a report within 30 days outlining those funds, which could be used as leverage to get Mexico to help pay for the border wall. 161 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 153 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ktXu3D NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

By Aaron Blake By Aaron Blake January 25 at 3:56 PM Follow @aaronblake Steve Bannon, center, during a campaign rally for Donald Trump in Grand Rapids, Mich. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Update: The Post's Matea Gold has now confirmed that Trump's daughter, Tiffany Trump, is also registered to vote in two states -- New York and Pennsylvania. She is the second person close to Trump who has this distinction. And Trump's\u00a0 Treasury secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin \u00a0is as well. President Trump says he will\u00a0 launch an investigation into his baseless claims of widespread voter fraud . But one of the potential areas he highlighted for probing \u2014 voters who are registered in two different states \u2014 appears as though it would snag his own top adviser. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that his \"major investigation into VOTER FRAUD\" would be \"including those registered to vote in two states.\" I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 One of those people, as it happens, is apparently Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's chief White House strategist. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune\u00a0 reported Tuesday evening \u00a0that Bannon was registered to vote in both Florida and New York. The Post's Matea Gold, meanwhile, reports he attempted to de-register in Florida , but that it was never received or processed: Bannon registered to vote in New York on Oct. 14, 2016, and cast an absentee ballot there, according to New York City elections officials. At the time, he was serving as chief executive of now-President Trump's campaign. But he was also registered in Sarasota County, Fla., where he had been on the voter rolls since Aug. 25 , officials said. White House officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On the day before the Nov. 8 election, Bannon sent a letter to then-Sarasota County Elections Supervisor Kathy Dent, informing her that he had moved to New York and requesting that he be removed from the rolls,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the letter who shared details about it with The Washington Post. Since the letter was sent Nov. 7, it is unlikely it would have arrived before Election Day. However, on Wednesday, Sarasota elections officials said they still had no record of receiving it. \"None of us recall getting it,\" said the current elections supervisor, Ron Turner, who took office in January after previously serving as the agency's chief of staff. Even if it was merely an honest mistake or paperwork glitch, it's an example of how two\u00a0of the three\u00a0things Trump says he wants investigated for \"VOTER FRAUD\" \u2014 dual registrants and \"those registered to vote who are dead\" \u2014 simply don't constitute fraud. These things happen quite a bit, almost always for non-nefarious reasons, and they aren't actually proof of the 3 million to 5 million illegal votes that Trump has baselessly claimed were cast in the 2016 election. even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 Those alleging voter fraud have long pointed to\u00a0people still being registered to vote after they die and to those registered in two states as proof that voter fraud exists or is possible, as White House press secretary Sean Spicer\u00a0did Tuesday while being pressed for proof of Trump's claims. Spicer mentioned a 2012 Pew study that estimated that as much as 13 percent of national voter registrations were inaccurate or invalid . But an author of that same study emphasized after Spicer's briefing that this was simply faulty registrations \u2014 not voter fraud. We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted. \u2014 David Becker (@beckerdavidj) November 28, 2016 And Bannon's problem is actually quite common, as the Pew study notes: This study found that almost 2.7 million people appear to be registered in two states, and more than 70,000 people could be registered in three or more. In all, more than 2.75 million people appear to have multiple registrations. As is dead people being registered to vote: More than 1.8 million records for people who are no longer living, but have registrations on voter rolls. But these are registrations, not actual votes. And there are very, very few proven instances of dead people voting or people voting in two states \u2014 and certainly not even close to being on the scale of millions in one election. Let's assume Trump does launch this investigation \u2014 which remains an open question given that the Justice Department isn't commenting and Republican congressional leaders view this as a useless distraction. If and when there is no evidence of the millions of illegal votes Trump has alleged, he and fellow voter fraud crusaders may again point to these dual registrants and registered dead voters as proof of voter fraud. But now, if Trump does that, he'll basically be accusing his own chief adviser of fraud \u2014 which is just about\u00a0a perfect microcosm of this whole wild goose chase. The Post's Michelle Ye Hee Lee explains why White House press secretary Sean Spicer's claims on Jan. 24 about voter fraud in the presidential election don't add up.

(Photo: Marco Ugarte, AP) 7635 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 114 COMMENTEMAILMORE The Trump-Fox Twitter feud continues. Former Mexican President\u00a0Vicente Fox Quesada on Wednesday resumed his profane assault on President Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and make the country pay for it. White House press secretary \"Sean Spicer, I've said this to @realDonaldTrump and now I'll tell you: Mexico is not going to pay for that (expletive)\u00a0wall ,\" Fox tweeted. He even has a hashtag for his obscene language. Trump spoke Wednesday about his executive order to\u00a0\"begin immediate construction of a border wall\" that Mexico eventually would finance, a pledge that was a centerpiece of his campaign for president. Fox\u00a0has trolled Trump on Twitter repeatedly, vowing that Mexico will never pay for the wall and asking\u00a0if Trump is a \"legitimate president.\" The executive order Trump\u00a0signed Wednesday instructed executive branch agencies to identify all federal assistance they sent to Mexico over the past five years. That includes all \"bilateral and multinational development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid and military aid.\" Trump says border wall will 'also help Mexico' The agencies are required to submit a report within 30 days outlining those funds, which could be used as leverage to get Mexico to help pay for the border wall, which could cost billions to construct in areas where there is no barrier. Fox feels strongly about the issue because as a former governor of Guanajuato, he oversaw an influx of auto\u00a0manufacturing plants under the NAFTA trade deal, which Trump complains has cost the United States jobs. Fox attempted to deepen U.S.-Mexico\u00a0relations after taking office and appeared to be gaining ground on an immigration reform package, only to have the\u00a0Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks\u00a0scuttle those\u00a0efforts. \u201cHis allies now turn out to be Trump\u2019s enemies, so Fox is being true to form,\u201d said Federico Est\u00e9vez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cHe\u2019s playing with [the attacks] at a circus level of rhetoric and splashiness, but he really is being true to how his vision started.\u201d Contributing: David Agren in Mexico City 7635 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 114 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kuid7z NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

A rally held by those seeking to compel Santa Ana to become a sanctuary city for immigrants in December. (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) Ruben Vives Contact Reporter President Trump\u2019s vow to crack down on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that protect immigrants in the U.S. illegally has met with resolve, at least so far, in some California communities. Details about Trump\u2019s crackdown remain unclear. Trump on Wednesday signed two executive orders designed to\u00a0begin building a border wall with Mexico, add lockups for detaining immigrants who cross the border illegally, enhance enforcement powers for border agents and\u00a0strip federal funding to cities that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement. According to a draft document reviewed by The Times, under the new order,\u00a0 the federal government would threaten to withhold funds \u00a0from cities that limit cooperation with immigration officials.\u00a0 More than 400 jurisdictions across the country have some sort of sanctuary policy, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and about 40 others in California. (Brian Bennett and Noah Bierman) Several smaller towns in Los Angeles County have declared\u00a0themselves sanctuary cities, and now leaders of those municipalities\u00a0are wondering\u00a0how Trump\u2019s orders will affect them.\u00a0 More than a year ago, Cudahy, a small\u00a0working-class town southeast of downtown Los Angeles, declared itself a sanctuary city to encourage\u00a0immigrants without legal status to\u00a0cooperate with police. \u201cIt was a symbolic gesture to say: You\u2019re here already. You\u2019re free to live your lives, and you can call\u00a0police,\u201d\u00a0said City Councilman Cristian\u00a0Markovich. Markovich said the policy has no legal teeth because it doesn\u2019t\u00a0supersede\u00a0federal law.\u00a0He said there might be\u00a0some cooperation with federal authorities, such as police turning over immigrants in the country illegally who commit\u00a0serious violent crimes. Markovich\u00a0said he would oppose any Trump plans to withhold\u00a0federal funds from sanctuary cities.\u00a0 \u201cWe pay our fair share, and that funding should go to the city regardless of whether the city is a sanctuary city or not,\u201d\u00a0Markovich said.\u00a0 He\u00a0said one way the city could be affected would be the withholding of funds from the\u00a0Community Development Block Grant program, which is used for\u00a0parks and public housing.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to stick to my guns and say this is a good piece of policy for our city,\u201d\u00a0Markovich said. In 2006, the 1-square-mile town of Maywood declared itself a sanctuary city.\u00a0 \u201cIt became second nature,\u201d\u00a0Mayor Pro Tem\u00a0Eduardo De La Riva said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a topic of discussion because California became so progressive over the years, it was sort of the norm. \u201cBut ever since Trump entered the national stage\u00a0and\u00a0because of his rhetoric, more cities became sanctuary cities and it once again came to the spotlight, and now we\u2019re having to ask, \u2018What does it mean to be a sanctuary city?\u2019 \u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0 De La Riva, who was not on the City Council when Maywood declared\u00a0itself a\u00a0sanctuary city, said the city doesn\u2019t plan to abandon the policy. California is going to fight Trump all the way and that's great to have the support from state leadership. \u2014 Maywood Mayor Pro Tem Eduardo De La Riva \u201cWe\u2019re going to wait and see what the executive order\u00a0states, and then we\u2019re going to have a discussion on what that means for Maywood moving forward,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cCalifornia is going to fight Trump all the way, and that\u2019s great to have the support from state leadership. I think we\u2019re sending a clear message when you have several of the largest cities also saying we\u2019re going to take a stance.\u201d Sanctuary policies have become good politics in cities with large Latino populations. But the protections cities afford vary\u00a0widely. There is no neat definition of \u201csanctuary city,\u201d but in general, cities that adopt the designation seek to offer political support or practical protections to people who are in the country illegally. For some cities, the sanctuary\u00a0movement consists simply of encouraging\u00a0people without legal status to get more involved in government.\u00a0For instance, Huntington Park has never declared itself a sanctuary city but appointed two people without legal status to a city commission, a move that generated national attention. Other places, such as San Francisco, adopt far-reaching\u00a0policies, such as taking steps to cut ties with federal immigration officials and refusing to fully cooperate with them. San Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city in 1989, and city officials strengthened the stance in 2013 with its \u201cDue Process for All\u201d ordinance. The law\u00a0declared that local authorities could not keep immigrants in custody to be handed over to federal immigration officials if they had no violent felonies on their records and did not currently face charges. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank that advocates for restrictions on immigration, said cutting off funding to sanctuary cities was a long time coming.\u00a0 \u201cMoney talks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there probably will be some die-hards who will continue to play chicken on this, and they may face other consequences, such as litigation.\u201d She said it would behoove Trump to expand the types of funding that could be cut off, possibly to include Department of Homeland Security funding. Inside\u00a0Express Coin Laundry in Maywood, clothes whirled inside washers and dryers, while\u00a0President\u00a0Trump spun in the minds of some customers at the laundromat. Among them was Hector Cruz, 25, a Mexican national\u00a0whose newborn son slept in an infant car seat. \u201cI'm afraid of immigration raids,\u201d Cruz said, peeking over at his son. \u201cI'm worried of being separated from family.\u201d\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss In a fiery State of the State, Brown returned to a familiar conclusion. \u00a0 President Trump signed executive orders reviving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects . Prosecutors believed two officers feared for their lives when they fatally shot Ezell Ford in 2014. \u00a0 'La La Land' danced its way to 14 Oscar nominations.

Albany Fire Chief Ron Rowe told a news conference the search for 2-year-old Detrez Green resumed at first daylight Wednesday. The boy\u2019s mother told authorities he slipped away from her Sunday afternoon and toddled into their kitchen just before a tornado sent an oak tree crashing through their home. \u201cHe was playing with a toy the last time I saw him,\u201d Kevian Green, the boy\u2019s father, told reporters. \u201cI just hope they can find him.\u201d Crews were searching \u201cevery inch\u201d of the Piney Woods Estates mobile home park where the boy lived, including up in any trees the storm left standing, said Albany Dougherty Search and Rescue Commander Chuck Mitchell. \u201cHe could be anywhere,\u201d Mitchell told WALB-TV.\u00a0 The Deep South is reeling after tornadoes swept through over the weekend. Twenty people were killed and more than 60 hurt, and scores of building... The twister was among at least 21 confirmed by the National Weather Service to have touched down in Georgia over the weekend, when a midwinter outbreak of thunderstorms and tornadoes threatened millions from Louisiana to the Carolinas . The storms were blamed for at least 20 deaths: 15 in Georgia, four in Mississippi and one in Florida. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal toured the destruction Wednesday by helicopter in Albany before heading to nearby Cook County, where seven people perished in a single mobile home park. He said more than 300 state workers were in southwest Georgia assisting with recovery efforts and federal workers were on the ground and ready to help once there\u2019s an official disaster declaration from Washington. Asked if he was expecting a faster federal response under President Trump, a fellow Republican, Deal said: \u201cI told them this was their opportunity to show what they can do for Georgia. I hope that will spur them on.\u201d Ralph Hudgens, the state insurance commissioner, has estimated the weekend storms caused at least $100 million in damage in Georgia . Search and rescue workers in Albany were looking for the missing toddler from dawn until dusk. Rescue crews had combed through the rubble of the boy\u2019s home but found nothing. On Wednesday they were still sifting through debris of neighboring homes. \u201cWe keep a positive attitude throughout our searches until we find an ending,\u201d said Bobby Spargo, an Albany fire captain. \u201cNone of us can dictate or say what that\u2019s going to be.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

Robert Levine,\" Mara Buxbaum said in an email. \"A groundbreaking actress, producer, and passionate advocate for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Mary will be remembered as a fearless visionary who turned the world on with her smile.\" In 1995, 25 years after The Mary Tyler Moore Show first aired, the actress clearly recalled shooting the scenes for its memorable opening credits. \"It was freezing cold,\" she told WHYY's Fresh Air. \"It was in Minneapolis in January, I think. We didn't know what we were doing \u2014 we were just there to grab a lot of footage that shows a young woman's exuberance [over] being in a new city.\" Article continues after sponsorship The final opening credits showed Moore's character tossing her hat in the air. With it, she's tossing out all the baggage of her last life and starting over in the newsroom of Minneapolis' WJM-TV. Moore plays Richards as young, polite and very determined. In the first episode, when crotchety news director Lou Grant, played by Ed Asner, asks Richards about her age and relationship status during a job interview, she challenges his line of questioning. \"You've been asking a lot of very personal questions that don't have a thing to do with my qualifications for this job,\" she says. \"It was the most powerful moment in theater I've had, because she played it so beautifully,\" Asner told NPR in 2001. \"The audience was going 'oh-goo-goo' at that moment.\" Enlarge this image From 1961 to 1966, Moore played opposite Dick Van Dyke on The Dick Van Dyke Show.

In 2011, Van Dyke told NPR he thought they had a bit of a crush on each other while filming the show. CBS via Getty Images By the time Moore appeared in The Mary Tyler Moore Show, she was already an experienced comedic actor and producer. Her production company MTM Enterprises (formed with her second husband, Grant Tinker) was also responsible for the sitcoms Rhoda, The Bob Newhart Show and WKRP in Cincinnati. Moore had learned her craft while playing homemaker Laura Petrie for five seasons on The Dick Van Dyke Show. Her chemistry with her on-screen husband, played by Dick Van Dyke, was so electric that CBS insisted her character had to be a single woman on her later show \u2014 the network didn't want viewers to think they had divorced. Van Dyke cheerfully admitted this to NPR in 2011: \"Around the second season, we would try to rehearse and begin to giggle for no reason. And a psychiatrist said, 'You have a crush on each other.' And I realized that's true! And I think it showed on the screen. I think that's why people thought we were really married because we had a wonderful connection.\" Laura Petrie also wasn't the typical 1960s housewife people were used to seeing on TV. \"Laura actually had opinions of her own,\" Moore said. \"And while she was asserting herself, she also didn't make Dick Van Dyke look like a dummy. I mean, society's expectations at that point still said, 'Hey, wait a minute, lady, you only go so far here.' But I think we broke new ground.\" Moore accepts the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 2012. Mark J.

Terrill/AP The character also wore capri pants in a time when skirts and heels were the height of TV fashion. Moore proved she could wear what she wanted and also sometimes take the comic lead to Van Dyke's straight man. She said she had always been a fan of the comedian Nanette Fabray, and she channeled Fabray to conjure up those trademark comic tears . \"There was definitely a cracking in the voice and an inability to maintain a tone and a certain amount of verbal yodeling that took place,\" Moore said. The Women Who Inspired Other Women With 'Mary Tyler Moore' In her real life, the actress was not the single, free-wheeling Mary Richards that America embraced. The real Mary was married by the time she was 18. She was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., but she grew up in Los Angeles with a mother who battled alcoholism, a problem that later afflicted Moore and both her siblings. \"I probably never was really out-and-out drunk,\" Moore recalled. \"And I certainly never drank during the daytime, but I wasted a lot of my time and I forgot a lot because I didn't remember much of what happened the night before.\" Moore channeled some of that unhappiness for her role as a grieving mother in 1980's Ordinary People, a performance that earned her an Academy Award nomination. To this day, however, it's her comedy that endures. In downtown Minneapolis, there's a statue of her as Mary Richards twirling her cap \u2014 a moment of hope and promise, frozen in time. ",

By David Nakamura By David Nakamura January 25 at 4:18 PM Follow @davidnakamura President Trump on Wednesday began putting in place his plan to ratchet up immigration enforcement, following through on major campaign pledges by signing executive actions to build a border wall with Mexico and cut off funds to cities that do not report undocumented immigrants to federal authorities. In an appearance at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump kicked off the rollout of a series of directives aimed at clamping down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States and potentially tightening restrictions on those trying to come to the country through legal channels. Aides said more directives could come later this week, including new restrictions on refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries over concerns about terrorism. The presidential directives signed Wednesday aim to create more detention centers, add thousands of Border Patrol agents and withhold federal funds from what are known as sanctuary cities, which do not comply with federal immigration laws. One order calls for the \u201cimmediate construction of a physical wall.\u201d [ Read Trump\u2019s executive order on the border and immigration ] \u201cWe are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,\u201d Trump told a crowd of DHS employees, who applauded several times during the president\u2019s remarks. \u201cBeginning today, the United States gets control of its borders.\u201d The construction of a wall along the southern U.S. border was Trump\u2019s chief campaign promise as he blamed illegal immigration for constricting the U.S. job market for Americans and adding to national security concerns. But his moves prompted an immediate backlash from congressional Democrats and immigrant rights groups, which accused the president of hyperbole to whip up fear in the electorate at the expense of immigrants and refugees. Protesters gathered outside the White House within hours of Trump\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe hateful, xenophobic, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that was a hallmark of the Trump campaign is starting to become a reality,\u201d said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cChaos and destruction will be the outcome.\u201d Though Trump promised that construction of the border wall would begin within months, it remained unclear how his directive would accelerate the project or pay for the added enforcement personnel. Federal funds would have to be appropriated by Congress, and construction industry analysts have said the total costs of a barrier along the southern U.S. border with Mexico could approach $20 billion. Trump\u2019s directives also call for an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 10,000 immigration officials. Administration officials have said they are discussing funding options with GOP lawmakers. 1 of 23 What it looks like along the border fence between the U.S. and Mexico View Photos With a border nearly 2,000 miles long between the United States and Mexico, about 650 miles of fencing is already in place along parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.

In an interview with ABC News , Trump said construction would begin \u201cas soon as we can physically do it. I would say in months.\u201d He has said the project would start with U.S. tax dollars in order to begin quickly, but he reiterated his promise that the United States would be reimbursed by the Mexican government. Trump is scheduled to welcome Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 who told him during the campaign that his administration would not pay for a wall \u2014 for a bilateral meeting at the White House next week. Mexicans called on Pe\u00f1a Nieto to cancel the summit. [ Mexicans want their president to cancel Washington visit after Trump touts his wall ] \u201cWe\u2019ll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico,\u201d Trump said in the television interview. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form.\u201d Congressional Republicans cheered Trump\u2019s announcement as a long overdue focus on border security, but Democrats warned that it would torpedo efforts to achieve bipartisan consensus on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that eluded the administrations of Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama. Democrats have called for stricter enforcement to be coupled with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have not committed additional crimes. \u201cTurning away legitimate asylum seekers at the border, and requiring mandatory detention of families and children, will do nothing to make America safer,\u201d Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) said. Trump kicked off his campaign with a fiery speech in 2015 during which he referred to illegal immigrants from Mexico as criminals and rapists and pledged to make stronger enforcement a centerpiece of his agenda. The strategy defied a growing consensus among establishment Republicans that the GOP must pursue comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship, in order to make inroads with the fast-growing Latino population. After a comprehensive reform bill died in Congress in 2014, Obama moved to focus his administration\u2019s enforcement efforts on those who had committed felonies or had ties to terrorism. During his visit to DHS, Trump thanked the Border Patrol agents and immigration officers who, he claimed, \u201cunanimously endorsed me\u201d \u2014 though it was the unions representing the employees, whose leadership had chafed at Obama\u2019s policies, that had backed his candidacy. Trump told the employees that retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, sworn in last week as the new homeland security secretary, would be charged with carrying out his directives. \u201cHe\u2019s a rough, tough guy, but he\u2019s also got a good heart,\u201d Trump said. Trump also recognized members of the Remembrance Project, a Texas-based advocacy group that represents the families of victims who were killed by people not legally in the country. Trump was frequently joined by the parents of these victims at campaign rallies, especially those in states close to the southern border. On Wednesday, he thanked them having \u201ckept the flame of justice alive.\u201d \u201cYour children will not have lost their lives for no reason,\u201d Trump said. The executive actions include measures to bolster enforcement inside the United States, suggesting that Trump aims to make good on promises to boost workplace raids and ramp up deportations. The actions include a directive to Kelly to examine ways to limit federal funding to sanctuary cities \u2014 including Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco \u2014 that were a focus of attacks from Trump on the campaign trail. And White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the Trump administration would resume the Secure Communities program that granted greater immigration enforcement powers to local authorities \u2014 a program that was shut down by the Obama administration over concerns it had led to abuse. Yet Trump on Wednesday did not sign any orders overturning the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has allowed more than 700,000 younger immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to apply for two-year work visas. During the campaign, Trump had promised to end DACA, which has been enormously popular among the immigrant rights community. \u201cThe president understands the magnitude of this problem,\u201d Spicer said of DACA. \u201cHe\u2019s a family man. He has a huge heart.\u201d Trump will work through it \u201cin a very humane way,\u201d the spokesman added. Jenna Johnson contributed to this report. Read more: ",
