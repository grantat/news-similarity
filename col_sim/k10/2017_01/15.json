    "text": "Email Protesters gathered Saturday to support immigrant rights at rallies around the U.S., denouncing President-elect Donald Trump for his anti-immigrant rhetoric and his pledges to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and to crack down on Muslims entering the country. A standing-room-only crowd packed into a historic African-American church in downtown Washington for one of dozens of rallies around the nation. \"We are not going to allow Donald Trump to bury the Statue of Liberty,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, told participants in Washington. \"We are a nation for all people, regardless of religion, regardless of background, regardless of who you love.\" In Chicago, more than 1,000 people poured into a teachers' union hall to support immigrant rights and implore each other to fight for those rights against what they fear will be a hostile Trump administration. Ron Taylor, a pastor of a Chicago area Disciples for Christ Church and executive director of the United Congress of Community and Religious Organizations, told the audience there, \"Regardless of what happens in the coming days we know that good will conquer evil and we want to say to each and every one of you, you are not alone.\" The protests mark the latest chapter in a movement that has evolved since 2006, when more than a million people took to the streets to protest a Republican-backed immigration bill that would have made it a crime to be in the country illegally. The crowds this weekend at rallies or cultural events in Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, California, and elsewhere, are expected to be nowhere near as big as then. Yet the line to enter Metropolitan AME Church in Washington stretched nearly a city block. People attending included immigrants who lack permission to be in the country and their relatives and supporters. Also present were elected officials, clergy and representatives of labor and women's groups. Participants carried signs with messages including \"Resist Trump's Hate\" and \"Tu, Yo, Todos Somos America,\" which translates to \"You, me, we all are America.\" \"I stand here because I have nothing to apologize for. I am not ashamed of my status because it is a constant reminder to myself that I have something to fight for,\" said Max Kim, 19, who was brought to the U.S. from South Korea when he was 6 and lacks legal permission to stay in the country. The Washington crowd urged Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress not to undo the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, aimed at helping people like Kim who were brought to the country as children. Michael Takada of the Japanese American Service Committee urged the Chicago audience to \"disrupt the deportation machine\" that he and others fear will ramp up when under the new president. He also urged them to keep a close eye on their local police departments and speak out if they see those departments help \"ICE to deport our community members.\" Dr. Bassam Osman, chair and co-founder of The Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago, elicited one of the loudest cheers from the crowd when he called out the president-elect by name in one of the opening prayers. \"Lord, this land is your land, it is not Trump's land.\" While there was plenty of cheering, there was also uneasiness and fear of what's to come after Trump is sworn in. Rehab Alkadi, a 31-year-old mother of a young son who came to the United States four years ago from war-torn Syria, said she doesn't believe she can be deported because \"there is a war in Syria, but who knows. It's so scary, what Trump says,' she said. \"He said a lot of things bad about the Muslim people.\" Former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn attended the rally in a show of support for immigrants' rights. \"You see the fear in light of the rhetoric that Trump verbalized in the course of his campaign,\" he told a reporter. \"The idea of a registry for Muslim people is wrong and people want to stand up for that.\" President Barack Obama in 2012 launched an executive effort to protect some young immigrants from deportation, after multiple proposals failed in Congress. The creation of the DACA program was heralded as a good first step by advocates who hoped it would be a prelude toward overhauling immigration laws. But that didn't happen, and Republican-led states pushed back against Obama's plans to expand the program. Now the focus is on the next administration. As a candidate, Trump promised his supporters stepped-up deportations and a Mexican-funded border wall, but it is unclear which plans the celebrity businessman will act on first, and when. And many immigrants are fearful of the campaign rhetoric but less motivated to protest in the absence of specific actions. Many participants Saturday said they would keep the pressure on Trump and said they planned to participate in next Saturday's Women's March on Washington. \"The threat of deportation is imminent for our communities,\" said Cristina Jimenez, executive director of United We Dream and one of the rally's organizers. \"We will keep fighting. We're not going back into the shadows.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Don Babwin in Chicago contributed to this story. 0 Shares ",

An INS officer chases suspected illegal immigrants during a 1993 raid in Los Angeles. (Boris Yaro / Los Angeles Times) Sara Saravia arrived in\u00a0the United States in\u00a01981 and quickly got a piece of advice: watch out for the\u00a0men in\u00a0uniforms. If they catch you, Saravia was told, you\u2019ll find yourself back in\u00a0El Salvador. \u00a0 One afternoon, she sat in a restaurant when three men\u00a0walked in.\u00a0They wore uniforms. Saravia bolted.\u00a0 \u201cI left my tacos on the table and took off running,\u201d she said, remembering that she ran so suddenly and so far that she didn\u2019t realize\u00a0she was fleeing from security guards, not immigration agents.\u00a0 As she peeled an orange outside of her apartment in Boyle Heights, the 77-year-old Saravia, now a U.S. citizen, shuddered at the memory.\u00a0 \u201cYou felt so afraid,\u201d she said,\u00a0\u201cyou couldn't even walk to the market.\u201d In the 1980s, the federal government launched aggressive\u00a0immigration\u00a0raids in Mexican and Central American communities in Los Angeles. Raids\u00a0were\u00a0carried out at\u00a0homes;\u00a0bus stops, nightclubs, vast agricultural fields and warehouses. They\u00a0were so frequent\u00a0that, for many immigrants in the country illegally, their children and other Latinos, it became a fact of life.\u00a0 The raids inspired everything from art to movies, such as the 1987 comedy film\u00a0\u201cBorn in East L.A.,\u201d written and\u00a0directed by its lead actor,\u00a0Richard \u201cCheech\u201d Marin.\u00a0 \u201cI\u00a0remember how normal it\u00a0was,\u201d Marin said of the roundups. \u201cThey were happening all around, and you were reading about it in the newspapers all the time.\u201d\u00a0 Now comes the impending presidency of Donald Trump , who staked much of his campaign  on promises of being tough on illegal immigration\u00a0and rallied large, boisterous\u00a0crowds of supporters with those vows.\u00a0 Trump has promised\u00a0to deport people here illegally but has not yet provided specifics of his plans. Some of his advisers have said workplace raids are likely to be part of Trump\u2019s crackdown. The president-elect\u2019s tough talk has won praise  from some who believe illegal immigration is harmful to the country and takes away jobs from citizens. But it has sparked anxiety in places like Southern California with large populations of undocumented workers. \u201cI think right now\u00a0there's lot of fear and uncertainty about how\u00a0Trump is going to\u00a0implement the policies\u00a0that he promised\u00a0to carry out when he was running as a candidate,\u201d said Angela Sanbrano, founder and former director of CARECEN, a nonprofit organization that provides legal services to immigrants. She said some fear he\u00a0\u201cmay\u00a0bring\u00a0back all those\u00a0terrifying moments and feelings of being afraid of the police and ICE.\u201d\u00a0 Angela Sanbrano, Chair of CARECEN, Central American Resource Center, holds a photograph of refugees from El Salvador staging a hunger strike calling for refugee status in 1979 in L.A.

At the time, Sanbrano was a law student and joined the refugees in solidarity for their cause. (Christina House / For The Times) The workplace raids became a searing symbol of the get-tough policies of a different era, mostly notably Proposition 187, the California ballot measure that banned immigrants\u00a0here illegally from receiving many\u00a0public services. Over the last 20 years, the tensions eased. Federal officials reduced workplace raids, in part after criticism from business groups and\u00a0immigration activists. Both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations focused on new tactics, such as forcing employers to fire workers here illegally.\u00a0 Trump has promised to build a wall on the border and make\u00a0Mexico pay for it. During a Republican debate, he\u00a0hailed the Eisenhower administration effort known by the outdated, racist name \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d\u2014\u00a0as a model for a \u201cdeportation force\u201d he said could\u00a0remove 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally. \u00a0 Trump has since\u00a0said the U.S. will pay for the\u00a0wall and seek reimbursement from Mexico. He\u00a0reduced the number of deportable immigrants to about 3 million, mostly those with criminal backgrounds \u2014\u00a0a number that experts say is far higher than the actual number of immigrants in the country illegally with criminal records. Trump said he wants\u00a0to\u00a0triple the number of ICE\u00a0agents, expand border patrol stations\u00a0and\u00a0terminate\u00a0two amnesty programs ushered under the Obama Administration.\u00a0 Claude Arnold,\u00a0former special agent in charge of Homeland Security investigations in Los Angeles, said he believes work site\u00a0enforcement\u00a0 will\u00a0increase under Trump. \u201cThe majority of people come to the U.S.\u00a0for work opportunity.\u00a0It\u2019s a magnet that brings them here,\u201d he\u00a0said.

Boris Yaro / Los Angeles Times Immigration agents lead suspected illegal immigrants out of a workplace in the City of Industry in 1985. Immigration agents lead suspected illegal immigrants out of a workplace in the City of Industry in 1985. (Boris Yaro / Los Angeles Times) Jessica Vaughan, director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates restricting immigration, said she doesn\u2019t \u201cthink we're going to see people being randomly picked up at bus stops or grocery stores.\u201d \"It's more likely that immigration enforcement will\u00a0return to what it was like from 2007-2011, when ICE had stepped-up immigration enforcement and received a lot of funding from congress to boost operations,\u201d she added.\u00a0 Perhaps no other state would be more\u00a0affected\u00a0by the incoming administration immigration\u00a0policies\u00a0than California, where more than 2.3 million immigrants who entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas\u00a0are located, according to the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank. Texas\u00a0has the second-largest population. California\u2019s \u00a0past hard views\u00a0of illegal immigration have softened over the years. Since Trump\u2019s election victory, mayors and police chiefs in\u00a0San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles vowed to uphold policies supportive of immigrants without legal status. In 2015, Gov. Jerry Brown signed immigration-related measures that included one that removed the word \"alien\" from the state\u2019s\u00a0labor code. He also signed legislation allowing noncitizens in high school to serve as election poll workers and protecting the rights of immigrant minors in civil suits. The state also allows people in the country illegally to obtain driver's licenses. L.A. is considering legalizing the now-common but largely illegal practice of street vending, hoping to avoid\u00a0misdemeanor convictions that could be used to deport people.\u00a0 State legislators are\u00a0already preparing for a\u00a0showdown with Trump, hiring former U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric Holder Jr. as an outside\u00a0counsel to advise on the state\u2019s legal strategy toward\u00a0the incoming administration. Joe Del Bosque, a 67-year-old from the Merced County city of\u00a0Los Banos who farms in Firebaugh, Calif.,\u00a0said he has vivid memories of the raids that happened in the cantaloupe farms he used to help manage in the 1970s and 80s. A small federal government plane would fly overhead\u00a0looking for work crews, he said. Soon, green-colored vans would follow.  Workers would panic, scatter and run. Farms would lose fruit because they didn\u2019t have enough people to pick. \u201cINS would come with their vans and circle the fields and then capture as many as they could,\u201d Del Bosque said.\u00a0 Ultimately, he said, the raids appeared to be more of a show, with immigrants dropped just across the border. Many returned within a few days, Del Bosque said, recalling a time when it was easier to cross the border. In the more than 30 years since he started his own farm, Del Bosque said, he\u2019s never been subject to an immigration workplace-enforcement operation. A labor shortage has forced him to not care about the background of the people who are hired\u00a0as long as they can satisfy the legal requirements of filing out I-9 and W4 forms. \u201cWe do everything legally,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they can provide us with the documents to fill out these documents, then they\u2019ve got a job.\u201d Marin said his movie, \u201cBorn in East L.A.,\u201d was the product of a different era, when California was a trailblazer of some of the strongest measures \u2014\u00a0and rhetoric \u2014\u00a0against immigrants in the country illegally.\u00a0 He said the idea for\u00a0\u201cBorn in East L.A.\u201d came as he sat in his kitchen and read\u00a0about a local\u00a0teen who was in the country\u00a0legally but was\u00a0accidentally deported. At the same time, Bruce Springsteen\u2019s song\u00a0\u201cBorn in the USA\u201d was playing on the radio, he said. \u00a0 Marin made a parody of the song ahead of the film, which became a success. The film starred Marin as a Mexican-American who spoke no Spanish but was deported to Mexico anyway. Though it was a comedy, Marin said, the film had an underlying truth about it.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the movie has endured. It touched on those real emotions and real situations,\u201d Marin said. In strongly Mexican-American neighborhoods like Boyle Heights and East L.A., children born in the U.S. would often jokingly and suddenly call out to each other \u201cla migra,\u201d a slang term\u00a0for immigration agents, in mock warning.

(Don Kelsen / Los Angeles Times) Now, many immigrants who lived through the \u201980s find themselves remembering their stories of being captured by or\u00a0narrowly\u00a0escaping immigration officers. \u00a0 Pablo Alvarado, director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said he recalled a story of a man at a day laborer site\u00a0who was in the middle of\u00a0getting his blood drawn as part of a county HIV test\u00a0program\u00a0when immigration officers pulled up in white vans.\u00a0 \u201cHe ripped the needle from his arm and ran,\u201d Alvarado said.\u00a0 Jesus Aguilar, co-founder of\u00a0CARECEN, was standing with three\u00a0other men at a corner street in the Pico-Union area on a January morning in 1981\u00a0when LAPD officers approached them.\u00a0 Aguilar said \u201cthey assumed we didn't have papers.\u201d\u00a0 And the\u00a0officers assumed right, he said.\u00a0 Aguilar said the officers drove\u00a0him and the others\u00a0to the immigration center downtown, where he said they were told\u00a0to sign documents that would expedite their deportations. Aguilar said he never signed. He\u00a0said he didn\u2019t want to return\u00a0to El Salvador, which was roiled by civil war.\u00a0He had done everything possible to escape it.\u00a0 \u201cSome people I knew who were Salvadoran\u00a0and were\u00a0deported had been assassinated,\u201d Aguilar said, adding that he applied for political asylum to delay his deportation.\u00a0 \u201cIt was the only alternative we could use as defense,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Until he could post bail, he remained under the custody of immigration officials for\u00a0nearly a year. Aguilar\u2019s efforts to delay his deportation eventually allowed him to\u00a0receive permanent residency after the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.\u00a0 Saravia,\u00a0the Salvadoran immigrant who\u00a0had abandoned her meal when she mistook security guards for immigration agents, said she calculated her every move until that law passed. She worked as a housekeeper in Beverly Hills because she believed working alongside Latinos increased her\u00a0chance of getting deported. She took the bus to and from work in the early morning to avoid bus raids, and rarely left\u00a0her apartment Maria Jaramillo, 55, said she was only 20 years old when she\u00a0came to U.S. from Mexico in 1981. Now a U.S. citizen, she said no one told her about the immigration raids until she learned about it on the news. After that, she spent the next five years wondering\u00a0when immigration officers would storm\u00a0the factory she worked at in downtown\u2019s garment district. \u201cThey would always come to the factories around there, but for some reason they would never come to mine,\u201d Jaramillo said. \u201cYou know, luck was on my side.\u201d\u00a0 @LATVives Times staff writer Cindy Carcamo contributed to this report.\u00a0 MORE ON IMMIGRATION ",

    "text": "Cost to Fix Michigan Sinkhole Estimated at More Than $78M By The Associated Press FRASER, Mich. \u0097 Jan 14, 2017, 4:03 PM ET 0 Shares Email The cost to fix a broken sewer line that caused a football field-sized sinkhole north of Detroit is estimated at more than $78 million, Macomb County's new public works chief says. The project's cost could rise above $100 million if more work is done to improve the rest of the sewer line, public works chief Candice Miller told Macomb County commissioners on Friday. The repairs could take about a year to complete. \"This is an enormous thing that's happening to the county,\" Miller said. \"We're up to the challenge. We're going to get through this thing. We're going to solve this problem. And somehow we've got to figure out how to pay for it.\" The sewer collapse was discovered after homeowners heard noises Christmas Eve and noticed their house was sinking. Officials temporarily evacuated nearly two dozen homes because water and gas service had to be shut off. Nineteen families have since been allowed to return. Three homes were eventually condemned. About 400,000 people in surrounding communities have been asked to take shorter showers and wash only full loads of clothing as part of a voluntary water conservation plea until a fix is completed. Officials have not yet determined an exact cause for the sewer collapse, but said earlier this month that a 2-inch diameter hole bored through the pipe after a 1978 collapse may have allowed groundwater to move up into the line and erode the soil beneath the pipe. Gov. Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency, allowing state resources to be funneled to Macomb County. That could also lead to seeking money from the federal government. Miller said the county may use bonds to help pay for the repairs. \"We're starting to talk about what we have to do from a financial standpoint here,\" Miller said. \"We're probably going to do a short-term bond. Maybe a long-term bond because we need some immediate cash for many of the expenses here.\" Water and sewage rates may also increase. \"The numbers are a little bit staggering, but at the same time, we are not sure yet where we're going to end up, or how much money we might be able to offset by with some funds the federal and state government,\" said Bob Smith, county commission chair. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Abby Phillip January 14 at 7:33 PM Follow @abbydphillip A public feud between Donald Trump and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) seemed to jettison any lingering hopes that the inauguration would temporarily ease partisanship in Washington and instead threatened to widen the rift between the two parties. Lewis\u2019s assertion that Trump is not a \u201clegitimate president\u201d and his announcement that he would skip Friday\u2019s inaugural ceremony prompted the president-elect to sharply criticize the civil rights leader Saturday morning. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\u201d Trump wrote in two tweets . \u201cAll talk, talk, talk \u2014 no action or results. Sad!\u201d Late Saturday evening, Trump continued to hammer Lewis in a third tweet . \u201cCongressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!\u201d Trump wrote. How a week of Trump tweets stoked anxiety, moved markets and altered plans Rep. John Lewis became the most high-profile Democratic lawmaker to announce that he is boycotting Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The president-elect, in response, said the Georiga Democrat was \u201call talk.\u201d (Tasos Katopodis/AFP/Getty Images) The incident has left Democrats and Republicans bracing themselves for yet another showdown between the president and his political opponents \u2014 one that threatens to usher in a new era of the kind of crippling hyper-partisanship that often characterized the eight years of the Obama administration. David Axelrod, former senior strategist and aide to President Obama, called Lewis \u201cas genuine and decent a person as you\u2019ll find,\u201d but he worried that Democrats risk adopting an originally Republican playbook in their dealings with Trump and that it won\u2019t advance the party\u2019s interests. \u201cThe question is how much can a democracy take of cycle after cycle of one side claiming illegitimacy,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cI as much as anybody else appreciate the anger because I was there when we basically faced a Republican blockade, even on things that Republicans had supported in the past. I saw how destructive that was and how difficult that was.\u201d \u201cIf you care about our democracy, how do you proceed now? Do you pay him back in kind?\u201d Axelrod asked. Voicing the anger and disappointment of many Democrats in Congress and beyond, Lewis said in an interview with NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that was published Friday that he does not believe Trump is a legitimate president, citing the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia intervened in the election to bolster Trump. \u201cI think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton,\u201d Lewis said. The comments prompted anger from Republicans \u2014 even those who do not support Trump \u2014 who said that Democrats are disregarding their own breathless warnings during the campaign about the risks of failing to accept the election results. \u201cWe listened to Democrats for the last two months of the campaign say that any suggestion that the elections weren\u2019t legitimate and the results wouldn\u2019t be accepted is dangerous and unpatriotic,\u201d said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist. \u201cNow those same people are trying to delegitimize Trump and say that he shouldn\u2019t be elected president.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were all the more charged as they came at the start of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend and were seen as dismissive of Lewis\u2019s work in the civil right movement, a time when he was subjected to arrest and assault. Adding to the racial overtones is the disparagement of Lewis\u2019s district, which is majority black, as \u201ccrime infested.\u201d Interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile called Trump\u2019s comments an \u201cattack on a living legend and a civil rights hero.\u201d \u201cI say that John Lewis took action. He took action marching from Selma to Montgomery,\u201d she said at a Democratic Party meeting in Phoenix. At least a dozen Democratic lawmakers have joined Lewis, saying that they plan to skip Trump\u2019s swearing-in. And on Twitter on Saturday, many of them jumped to the congressman\u2019s defense. Few Republican lawmakers weighed in. Two, Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Rep. Kevin Yoder (Kan.), tweeted support for Lewis even as they urged him to attend the inauguration. The Lewis tweets capped a week of Twitter flurries by the president-elect in which he went after what he viewed as insults from various people or entities, including Clinton, CNN, the intelligence community, BuzzFeed News and Meryl Streep. \u201cHis fundamental rule is that if you come after me in any way, I\u2019ll come after you,\u201d Axelrod noted. \u201cHe thinks he can bully people into cooperation. My experience has been that can drive people further away and make it harder. \u201cThere are some things that he\u2019s talking about wanting to do that he\u2019s going to need Democratic votes for.\u201d David Weigel in Phoenix contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Credit Al Drago/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 On Friday, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, declared that he did not view Donald J. Trump as a \u201clegitimate president.\u201d Mr. Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement, said he planned to boycott the inauguration, the first he will skip in three decades. On Saturday, Mr. Trump hit back. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a pair of early morning Twitter posts . \u201cAll talk, talk, talk \u2014 no action or results,\u201d he added. \u201cSad!\u201d While some questioned Mr. Lewis\u2019s assertion, many others expressed indignation about Mr. Trump\u2019s outburst, pointing out the unseemliness of attacking a civil rights leader on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Mr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders, beaten by police officers while marching from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama. Definition of bad strategy: trump saying 50 year fighter for civil rights John Lewis is \"all talk\" over Martin Luther King holiday weekend. \u2014         Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) Jan. 14, 2017 Others ridiculed Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of Mr. Lewis\u2019s district, which is majority African-American and encompasses three-quarters of Atlanta, as \u201chorrible,\u201d \u201cfalling apart\u201d and \u201ccrime infested.\u201d In fact, Georgia\u2019s Fifth Congressional District includes parts of wealthy areas like Buckhead; the world\u2019s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Georgia Institute of Technology. The 5th is hardly the hellhole of Trump's imagination. Have visited CDC there. Also has GA Tech and Emory. It is sad to run down Atlanta. https://t.co/lxnSzHQHHn \u2014         Michael Gerson (@MJGerson) Jan. 14, 2017 Some pointed out that fighting with Mr. Lewis distracted attention from a Senate investigation , announced the day before, that will look at possible contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign team and Russia. In addition, Mr. Trump\u2019s poll numbers have slipped into uncharted depths for an incoming president, with a Gallup poll released on Friday finding that about half of Americans disapprove of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition effort. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with Mr. Lewis carried echoes of his attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Pakistani-American parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq, after Mr. Khan spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Those attacks were widely viewed to have backfired, and Mr. Trump later modulated his words about the Khans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump himself has experience questioning a president\u2019s legitimacy. He was instrumental in sowing doubts about President Obama\u2019s birthplace. Mr. Lewis, who is 76 and was first elected to Congress in 1987, is one of the few genuinely historic figures on Capitol Hill, revered by Democrats and Republicans alike. Allies of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, circulated pictures of him linking arms with Mr. Lewis at the 50th anniversary of the Selma march to fend off accusations that Mr. Sessions was a racist. Nevertheless, Mr. Lewis testified against Mr. Sessions , declaring, \u201cWe need someone as attorney general who\u2019s going to look out for all of us, and not just some of us.\u201d A few critics, including David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said they disagreed with Mr. Lewis\u2019s statement that Mr. Trump was not legitimate, which he made in an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News and which will be broadcast on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Still, Mr. Axelrod said of Mr. Lewis: \u201cI honor the man he is. Honesty; integrity; courage \u2014 these are qualities you can\u2019t buy.\u201d I disagree with what @repjohnlewis said, but I honor the man he is. Honesty; integrity; courage-these are qualities you just can't buy. https://t.co/ew6a5ln5Wh \u2014         David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) Jan. 14, 2017 In his interview with Mr. Todd, Mr. Lewis said he believed that the Russians had delivered the election to Mr. Trump. \u201cYou know, I believe in forgiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It\u2019s going to be very difficult. I don\u2019t see this president-elect as a legitimate president.\u201d Mr. Lewis is one of a handful of Democratic members of Congress who have announced that they will boycott the inauguration on Friday. Others include Barbara Lee of California, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Luis Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois. Noah Weiland contributed reporting.

Spicer said there was nothing unusual about the call, but White House officials told NBC News it was not coordinated with them.

Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency , will have the opportunity to engineer a radical shift in Washington. If confirmed by the Senate, he is expected to shelve the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive environmental enforcement and embrace a more collaborative approach with the industries that the agency is charged with policing, many of which have helped him advance his political career. The impact would stretch from the nation\u2019s waterways to the planet\u2019s climate, since the E.P.A. carries out and enforces rules to combat global warming. \u201cHe has advocated and stood up for the profits of business, be it the poultry companies or the energy industry and other polluters, at the expense of people who have to drink the water or breathe the air,\u201d said Mark Derichsweiler, who led the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality division responsible for overseeing the poultry-related cleanup. Mr. Derichsweiler retired in 2015 after 40 years with the state, frustrated with Mr. Pruitt\u2019s approach. Photo Algae, caused by phosphorus and nitrates in chicken manure, on a rock pulled from the Illinois River in Tahlequah, Okla. Credit Nick Oxford for The New York Times Mr. Pruitt declined a request to comment. But his supporters contend that his record demonstrates a deeply held philosophy that states understand their needs best and should be allowed to regulate their own environment. On Thursday, a coalition of 23 powerful conservative advocacy groups endorsed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s nomination, in advance of his confirmation hearing, set for Wednesday. \u201cSome claim Mr. Pruitt opposes clean air and water. This could not be further from the truth,\u201d wrote the groups , which include the political action committee Club for Growth; the American Energy Alliance, which has advised Mr. Trump on energy policy; and Americans for Tax Reform, the group founded by the anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist. Mr. Pruitt, the endorsement said, \u201cunderstands that many of the nation\u2019s challenges regarding clean air and water are best met at the state and local level.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Pruitt, if confirmed, will take over the agency in an odd position: He has spent the last seven years suing it to block regulations that he would be expected to put into effect and enforce. Some legal scholars say he should recuse himself from major pending environmental matters, while groups like the Environmental Defense Fund are urging Congress to reject his confirmation. \u201cThe president\u2019s choices deserve a lot of deference from Congress and even environmental groups,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cBut at some point when the nominee has spent his entire career attempting to dismantle environmental protections, it becomes unacceptable. That\u2019s why Mr. Pruitt is the first E.P.A. nominee from either party that the Environmental Defense Fund has opposed in our 50-year history.\u201d Some experts say that while returning more authority to states can be desirable in some cases, environmental protection is probably not one of them. Smog and toxic chemicals that foul the air and waterways of one state may originate from one or several others, necessitating federal oversight of pollution. \u201cPollution doesn\u2019t respect state boundaries,\u201d said Patrick A. Parenteau, a professor of environmental law at Vermont Law School. \u201cStates have limited ability to regulate pollution from outside the state, and almost every state is downstream or downwind from other pollution.\u201d Case in point: the \u201cGreen Country\u201d chicken battle that Mr. Pruitt inherited in eastern Oklahoma. The phosphorus and nitrates in chicken manure were causing algae blooms in the ponds, streams and lakes of the 1.1-million acre Illinois River watershed, which reaches from Arkansas into Oklahoma. In 2005, Attorney General Drew Edmondson of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s predecessor, sued Tyson Food, Cargill Turkey and a dozen other major poultry producers for damages caused by the pollution and to force them to change the way they disposed of 300,000 tons a year of animal waste. Photo Drew Edmondson, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s predecessor as Oklahoma attorney general, arrived for closing arguments in the state\u2019s case against the Arkansas poultry industry in February 2010. Credit Cory Young/Tulsa World, via Associated Press As Mr. Pruitt ran for election, at least $40,000 in contributions poured into his campaign from nearly 30 executives at poultry companies named in the lawsuit or attorneys at law firms representing them, including Mark Simmons, the founder of Simmons Foods; Donald J. Smith, then the chief executive of Tysons Foods; and Gary Weeks, a lawyer listed on the court papers as representing George\u2019s, another company targeted in the lawsuit, according to data assembled by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group and confirmed by The New York Times. That money represents about 4 percent of the total $1 million he raised in the 2010 campaign, records show . After Mr. Pruitt took over, instead of pushing the federal judge for a ruling that, seven years later, still hasn\u2019t been issued, he negotiated an agreement with Arkansas and the poultry companies to conduct a study of the appropriate level of phosphorus in the Illinois River. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cRegulation through litigation is wrong in my view,\u201d Mr. Pruitt told The Oklahoman newspaper in 2015. \u201cThat was not a decision my office made. It was a case we inherited.\u201d J. D. Strong, director of Oklahoma\u2019s Wildlife Department and the state\u2019s former Secretary of Environment, praised Mr. Pruitt for negotiating the settlement. \u201cYou can\u2019t force a judge to rule,\u201d Mr. Strong said. \u201cPruitt didn\u2019t sit back and wait or badger the judge for a ruling. He worked to get the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas around the table.\u201d A spokesman from Tyson Food noted that the contributions to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s campaign were made by the company\u2019s executives and employees \u2014 including two former chief executives and members of the Tyson family \u2014 rather than by the company itself. \u201cWe\u2019ll point out that our employees are encouraged to participate in the election process of public officials at all levels, and are at liberty to make personal contributions to any campaign as they see fit,\u201d Worth Sparkman, the spokesman for Tyson, said. But Mr. Pruitt quietly allowed the expiration of a 2003 agreement that Mr. Edmondson helped negotiate with Arkansas to reduce poultry waste pollution \u2014 and to monitor the progress \u2014 without seeking another formal extension of the deal. And Mr. Pruitt shut down the specialized unit of four attorneys and a criminal investigator that had helped initiate the lawsuit against the 14 poultry companies. What do you think senators should ask Mr. Pruitt during his confirmation hearing to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency? That environmental unit had broad jurisdiction, forcing pork-producing farmers to spend millions of dollars on their own cleanups and collecting tens of millions of dollars to clean up toxic sites in the state, including poisonous waste left at an abandoned lead and zinc mine known as Tar Creek. Mr. Pruitt, in response to questions, provided a list of environmental enforcement actions taken during his tenure, but the list includes cases that were largely initiated under Mr. Pruitt\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Edmondson. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A spokesman for Mr. Pruitt said that while the environmental unit had been closed, environmental cases continued to be handled by the state solicitor general\u2019s unit. \u201cUnder the leadership of Attorney General Pruitt, this team has held bad actors accountable and protected stewardship of Oklahoma\u2019s natural resources.\u201d But Mr. Edmondson said that prosecution of such environmental crimes fell as a result of the shuttering of the unit. \u201cUnder his tenure as attorney general, I don\u2019t think environmental crimes have disappeared,\u201d Mr. Edmondson said of Mr. Pruitt, in an interview. \u201cIt is just the filing of cases alleging environmental crimes that has largely disappeared.\u201d Residents who live in eastern Oklahoma, where local ponds and streams are still often clogged with algae, said they, too, were frustrated. Phosphorus levels have declined considerably \u2014 a total of about 70 percent between 1998 and 2015 \u2014 but the largest reductions took place before Mr. Pruitt became attorney general, as wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded and more poultry farmers have shipped chicken waste for proper disposal. Still, the levels remain far above the state standard and the decline in pollution has been slower than some hoped. \u201cI want an attorney general \u2014 and a head of our E.P.A. \u2014 who is not averse to protecting Oklahoma\u2019s most outstanding waterways,\u201d said Ed Brocksmith, who is a co-founder of a group called Save the Illinois River . At the same time that he was retreating from his predecessor\u2019s more aggressive approach, Mr. Pruitt sent a series of letters to federal regulators that in some cases were drafted by industry lobbyists and then put on his state government stationary, open records obtained by The New York Times in 2014 showed. The letters pressed the federal government to back down on proposals to tighten controls over energy production, such as oil and gas wells that can release planet-warming methane. Photo Ed Brocksmith near the Illinois River, which he crosses several time a day. He said he wanted a state attorney general and head of the Environmental Protection Agency who was \u201cnot averse to protecting Oklahoma\u2019s most outstanding waterways.\u201d Credit Nick Oxford for The New York Times Mr. Pruitt separately filed a series of lawsuits against the federal government, challenging regulations intended to reduce the discharge of poisonous mercury from coal-burning power plants, carbon dioxide blamed for climate change and other emissions that federal authorities argued were causing unsightly haze in Oklahoma\u2019s air. In total, Mr. Pruitt filed 14 lawsuits challenging federal environmental regulations. In 13 of those cases, the co-parties included companies that had contributed money to Mr. Pruitt or to Pruitt-affiliated political campaign committees. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Pruitt separately has served as a leader of the Republican Attorneys General Association , which since 2013 has collected $4.2 million from fossil-fuel related companies , including Exxon Mobil, Koch Industries, Murray Energy and Southern Company, which in many cases have also supported the lawsuits he has filed. Given the scale of his regulatory challenges, Mr. Pruitt turned to major corporate law firms, which typically defend energy companies fighting these laws, for help. In some cases, that assistance was offered free. BakerHostetler, the Cleveland-based law firm whose clients have included dozens of energy industry players, assigned five of its lawyers to help Oklahoma overturn President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, intended to combat climate change. The law firm did not charge Oklahoma anything for the work, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office confirmed. David B. Rivkin Jr., the lead attorney from BakerHostetler who handled the matter , said that the work was considered charitable, similar to when major law firms give free legal advice to inmates at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay military prison. Environmentalists scoffed. \u201cThe industries and companies, through their corporate lawyers, are renting the state\u2019s seal in order to make it look like their self-interested arguments are being made by Scott Pruitt on behalf of a state,\u201d said David Doniger, director of the Climate and Clean Air Program at the Natural Resources Defense Counsel. \u201cIt is a disgrace.\u201d Even federal judges are skeptical. Mr. Pruitt joined with Missouri and several other mostly rural states in one federal suit to beat back California\u2019s regulations requiring egg farms, including those in Oklahoma, that wanted to sell in the state to seek more humane treatment of hens. In rejecting the suit, the federal judge admonished the plaintiffs. \u201cThe court concludes plaintiffs have not brought this action on behalf of their interest in the physical or economic well-being of their residents in general,\u201d Judge Kimberly J. Mueller of the United States District Court wrote in her 2014 opinion , \u201cbut rather on behalf of a discrete group of egg farmers whose businesses will allegedly be impacted.\u201d ",

    "text": "Marchers Brave Cold, Rain for MLK March in DC By jessica gresko, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 14, 2017, 4:56 PM ET 0 Shares Star Alex Wong/Getty Images Rev. Al Sharpton and National Urban League President Marc Morial lead the \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" march Jan. 14, 2017 at West Potomac Park in Washington, D.C. 0 Shares Email Despite rain and cold weather, marchers filled several blocks in Washington on Saturday as they rallied in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day march that was at times also a rally against President-elect Donald Trump. Civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton had organized Saturday's \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" march and rally ahead of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. But Trump, whose inauguration will take place in less than a week, was also on marchers' minds. Holding umbrellas and bundled against temperatures in the mid-30s the crowd chanted \"No justice, no peace\" and \"We will not be moved\" but also \"We will not be Trumped\" and \"Love Trumps hate.\" They cheered when one speaker referenced the comments of Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who has said he will not attend Trump's inauguration and, an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" set to air Sunday, that he doesn't consider Trump a \"legitimate president.\" \"We come not to appeal to Donald Trump, because he's made it clear what his policies are and what his nominations are. We come to say to the Democrats in the Senate and in the House and to the moderate Republicans to 'Get some backbone. Get some guts.' We didn't send you down here to be weak-kneed,\" Sharpton told marchers at a rally after they walked from the Washington Monument to a park near the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. Sharpton called on marchers to oppose Trump's nominee for Attorney General, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, and asked the crowd if they were willing to visit their senators' offices to oppose the nomination. He told them: \"We need to make some house calls. We need to stay a little while.\" He later told The Associated Press those visits, involving a number of groups, would begin within the next 10 days. Protesters also gathered Saturday to support immigrant rights at rallies around the U.S., including in Washington, denouncing Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and his pledges to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and to crack down on Muslims entering the country. The Washington crowd urged Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress not to undo the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, aimed at helping people who were brought to the country as children. Joining Sharpton were family members of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin and Walter Scott, black men whose names have become rallying cries following their deaths. \"When we leave here we have work to do,\" said Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 on Staten Island, New York, after a white officer placed him in a chokehold. Carr and Sharpton talked about voting rights, criminal justice reform, health care and \"a living wage\" as issues marchers should care about. Sybrina Fulton, whose son Trayvon Martin was fatally shot by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012, asked marchers to \"stand up and make a difference in your community.\" Marchers themselves expressed a range of emotions about Trump. Debra Conyers of East Orange, New Jersey , said she was a toddler in 1963 when Martin Luther King gave his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. She said Obama \"helped Wall Street \" and \"helped Main Street.\" As for Trump: \"I'm waiting to see how it unfolds,\" she said. Alicia James, a 48-year-old marketing consultant from New York City, said eight years ago she stood with her then 12-year-old son on the National Mall for Obama's first inauguration. She said she doesn't want to see Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act or undo other parts of Obama's legacy, but, she said, if it happens: \"You can't erase the impact he has had on this country.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jessicagresko 0 Shares ",

Whitley County Sheriff Colan Harrell says officers were called to the home of Larry and Courtney Taylor on Friday night after a relative went there to check on the family. Harrell told The Lexington Herald-Leader (bit.ly/2iwq3zm) that 41-year-old Courtney Taylor pointed a gun at two deputies who arrived at the home. One of the deputies shot her. She was taken to University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital with life-threatening injuries. Her condition was not known Saturday afternoon. Police found three people dead inside the home: Larry Taylor, 51; and the couple's two teenage daughters. Harrell says they had been dead for several hours before being found. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Information from: Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com 0 Shares ",

Slate editor-in-chief weighs in on FBI director, Russian hacking In a statement late Friday, Sens. Richard Burr. R-N.C., the committee\u2019s chairman, and Mark Warner, D-Va., the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said the panel \u201cwill follow the intelligence where it leads.\u201d Burr and Warner said that as part of the investigation they will interview senior officials from the Obama administration and the incoming Trump administration. They said subpoenas would be issued \u201cif necessary to compel testimony.\u201d \u201cWe will conduct this inquiry expeditiously, and we will get it right,\u201d the senators said. Sen. Mark Warner, left, D-Virginia, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, the committee\u2019s chairman, speak in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill Jan. 10, 2017, in Washington. Close Joe Raedle/Getty Images On Friday, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s team confirmed that his national security adviser, Michael Flynn , had direct communication with Russia\u2019s U.S. ambassador multiple times, including on the same day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia, expelling its diplomats, CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett reports. However, the Trump team said it was only limited to setting up a phone call between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. A declassified intelligence report released last week said Putin ordered a hidden campaign to influence the election to favor Mr. Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton, revelations that have roiled Washington . Political roundup: Comey fallout and confirmation hearings Mr. Trump and his supporters have staunchly resisted the findings and Mr. Trump has leveled a series of broadsides at U.S. intelligence agencies, even though he\u2019ll have to rely on their expertise to help him make major national security decisions once he takes over at the White House next week. He will be sworn in Jan. 20. At a news conference this week, Mr. Trump speculated that U.S. intelligence agencies might have leaked details about a classified briefing with him that included unsubstantiated allegations that Russia had collected compromising sexual and financial information about him. He said any such information was not true: \u201cIt\u2019s all fake news. It\u2019s phony stuff. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Outgoing defense secretary on Russia cyberattack, U.S. response The bulk of the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s work will be done in secret, although the senators said they will hold open hearings when possible. \u201cAs the committee\u2019s investigation progresses, we will keep Senate leadership, and the broader body, apprised of our findings,\u201d Burr and Warner said. Democrats and some Republicans have pressed for a special, select bipartisan committee to conduct the investigation, but Republican leaders have maintained that the existing committees are capable of handling the inquiries. According to the committee\u2019s statement, the inquiry will include: A review of the intelligence that informed the declassified report about Russia\u2019s interference in the election. \u201cCounterintelligence concerns\u201d related to Russia and the election, \u201cincluding any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns.\u201d Russian cyber activity and other \u201cactive measures\u201d against the United States during the election and more broadly. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Rain and snow hits the 4 corners with more rain in the South.

(Photo: Andrew Jansen/News-Leader) With Kansas and Missouri in the bull's eye, a\u00a0winter storm descended on the nation's midsection Saturday, bringing thick ice, dangerous driving conditions and power outages as it stretched\u00a0its tentacles as far east as the mid-Atlantic. There was little chance of a letup from the icy onslaught as another round of freezing rain was forecast for Sunday morning, keeping\u00a0ice warnings in place for the two states, as well as Oklahoma. Winter storm watches forecast up to three-quarters of an inch of ice and as much as three inches of snow across the central Plains and parts of Iowa, Illinois\u00a0and Nebraska. The National Weather Service said freezing rain would continue across a wide swath of north central Oklahoma, potentially bringing an additional 1.5 inches of ice accumulation to cities like Enid and Ponca City west and \u00a0northwest of Oklahoma City. By early afternoon, Aldrich, Mo., reported 0.75 inches of ice;\u00a0Bartlesville, Oklahoma, registered 0.28 inches; and Mayestown, Ill, had received 0.37 inches, according to weatherbug.com . 11 things to keep in your car this winter Parts of Springfield, Mo., experienced a round of \"thunder ice\" following lightning strikes amid a buildup of more than a quarter of an inch of ice on trees, fences and parked cars, the Springfield News-Leader reported . The relatively rare phenomenon, which only occurs in especially turbulent winter weather, was also reported as freezing rain fell in\u00a0Joplin, Mo., the Associated Press reported.

Residents were taking the warnings seriously. Grocery stores were selling out of bread, milk and other necessities, and hardware stores were running out of flashlights, batteries and alternative energy sources. \u201cThey\u2019re grabbing generators, and I\u2019m sold out,\u201d said Raymond Bopp, assistant manager of the Woodward Ace Hardware store in Woodward, Okla., about 140 miles northwest of Oklahoma City.

    "text": "5 Takeaways From Scathing Department of Justice Report on Chicago Policing By Morgan Winsor Jan 13, 2017, 3:03 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Feds Release Report on Chicago Police Abuse 0 Shares Email Federal investigators have determined that the Chicago Police Department has routinely violated the constitutional rights of citizens for years in numerous ways, such as using excessive force, permitting racially discriminatory conduct and shooting individuals who posed no immediate threats, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today. \u201cOne of my highest priorities as attorney general has been to ensure that every American enjoys police protection that is lawful, responsive and transparent,\u201d Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement today in announcing the findings. \u201cSadly, our thorough investigation into the Chicago Police Department found that far too many residents of this proud city have not received that kind of policing.\u201d After a year-long probe into the city\u2019s 12,000-officer police force, which began in December 2015 after the release of a dashcam video of a white officer\u2019s shooting a black teen, the Justice Department \u2019s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the North District of Illinois today released a scathing 161-page report that details their findings of \u201csystemic deficiencies\u201d in training and accountability that investigators say have led to a pattern or practice of using force in violation of the Constitution. CPD Officer Charged With Murder of Teen Hired by Police Union The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois said \u201cthese findings are not new\u201d and should come as no surprise to Chicago residents. After the report\u2019s release, officials from the Justice Department and the city of Chicago said today they have signed an agreement in principle to work together, with community input, to create a federal court-enforceable consent decree addressing the deficiencies uncovered during the investigation. An independent monitor, who has yet to be chosen, will oversee compliance with the consent decree, according to the Justice Department. \u201cWhile the Chicago Police Department has made real progress and achieved meaningful reforms, the incidents described in this report are sobering to all of us,\u201d Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters today. \u201cPolice misconduct will not be tolerated anywhere in this city and those who break the rules will be held accountable for their actions.\u201d Here are some highlights from the report: CPD Uses Deadly Force in Violation of Constitution According to the report, federal investigators found that the Chicago Police Department engaged in a pattern or practice of using force that is unreasonable and unconstitutional, including the following: shooting at fleeing suspects who presented no immediate threat; shooting at vehicles without justification; using less-lethal force, including Tasers, against people who pose no threat; using force to retaliate against and punish individuals; and using excessive force against juveniles. \u201cThis pattern is largely attributable to systemic deficiencies within CPD and the City,\u201d the report stated, citing, among other shortcomings, the department\u2019s historical failure to train its officers in de-escalation and failure to conduct meaningful investigations of uses of force. For instance, federal investigators observed police academy training on deadly force that consisted of a video made decades ago, which the report said was inconsistent with both current law and the Chicago Police Department\u2019s own policies. \u201cThe impact of this poor training was apparent when we interviewed recruits who recently graduated from the Academy: only one in six recruits we spoke with came close to properly articulating the legal standard for use of force,\u201d the report stated. \u201cPost-Academy field training is equally flawed.\u201d The deficiencies in officer training are exacerbated by the lack of adequate supervision provided to officers in the field, the report said. The Majority of Cases Are Not Investigated The report found the city of Chicago fails to investigate the majority of cases it is required to by law, including misconduct allegations filed against police officers. The ones that are investigated, \u201cwith rare exception, suffer from entrenched investigative deficiencies and biased techniques,\u201d and discipline taken against the accused officers is \u201chaphazard,\u201d \u201cunpredictable\u201d and \u201cdoes little to deter misconduct,\u201d according to the report. Federal investigators, who reviewed hundreds of investigative files, found that civilian and officer witnesses \u2013 and even the accused officers \u2013 are frequently not interviewed during an investigation. The city investigators also frequently failed to collect basic evidence and have allowed union representatives and attorneys to \u201ccoach officers in the middle of recorded interviews -- with official protocols actually prohibiting investigators from preventing this, or even referring to it on tape,\u201d the report stated. The report also detailed a lack of transparency regarding officer misconduct complaints, saying the \u201ccomplainants themselves are often kept in the dark about the status of their cases\u201d and the city investigators do not provide periodic updates to individuals complaining of officer misconduct. \u201cSeveral complainants told us that they were left unaware of what was happening with their complaint for months, or even years \u2013 and some never heard back at all,\u201d the report stated. CPD \u2018Tolerated Racially Discriminatory Conduct\u2019 The report called on the city of Chicago to address \u201cserious concerns\u201d about systemic deficiencies within the police department that disproportionately affect black and Latino communities. According to the report, statistics show the Chicago Police Department uses force almost 10 times more often against blacks than against whites. \u201cCPD\u2019s pattern or practice of unreasonable force and systemic deficiencies fall heaviest on the predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods on the South and West Sides of Chicago, which are also experiencing higher crime,\u201d the report stated. \u201cAs a result, residents in black neighborhoods suffer more of the harms caused by breakdowns in uses of force, training, supervision, accountability and community policing.\u201d According to the report, the Chicago Police Department \u201ctolerated racially discriminatory conduct\u201d that federal investigators say contributes to its pattern of unreasonable force. Federal investigators reviewed the police department\u2019s complaint database, which showed 980 police misconduct complaints coded as discriminatory verbal abuse on the basis of race or ethnicity from 2011 to March 2016. Just 13 of those complaints, or 1.3 percent, were sustained, generally when there was audio, video or other irrefutable evidence, the report said. Federal investigators found 354 complaints for the use of the word \u201cn-----\u201c or one of its variations. Only four, or 1.1 percent, of these complaints were sustained, according to the report. Federal investigators also found that some officers expressed discriminatory views and intolerance with regard to race, religion, gender and national origin in public social media forums. Meanwhile, the police department failed to take sufficient steps to prevent or appropriately respond to this issue, the report said. The report urged the city to restore its police-community trust by addressing both discriminatory conduct and the disproportionality of illegal and unconstitutional patterns of force on minority communities. \u201cWe have serious concerns about the prevalence of racially discriminatory conduct by some CPD officers and the degree to which that conduct is tolerated and in some respects caused by deficiencies in CPD's systems of training, supervision and accountability,\u201d the report stated. CPD\u2019s Promotions System Viewed as Political and Unfair According to the report, officers in the Chicago Police Department can be promoted to detective, sergeant or lieutenant based on test scores or evaluation of other merit-based criteria. Legal challenges of discriminatory impact and allegations of improper exam procedures have prompted several significant reforms to the department\u2019s promotions system. However, the report said, federal investigators spoke to officers who continued to express skepticism. \u201cOne of the major complaints from officers we interviewed is that CPD\u2019s promotions system lacks transparency regarding the nomination and qualification process for merit promotions. This has led many officers to believe that merit promotions are a reward for cronyism, rather than a recognition of excellence that was overlooked by the testing process,\u201d the report stated. \u201cMany of the officers we spoke with \u2014 minority and non-minority alike \u2014 told us that they feel merit promotions are not truly based on \u2018merit,\u2019 but rather the \u2018clout\u2019 you hold in the Department or \u2018who you know.\u2019\u201d The report continues: \u201cIn reality, there are documented instructions and guidance for merit promotion nominators and decision makers, but this information is not widely known.\u201d Insufficient Support for Officer Wellness and Safety The federal investigation found that the acute stress and pressure Chicago police officers face each day weigh heavily on them. For instance, the report found that the rising levels of gun violence in Chicago neighborhoods where the relationship between officers and the communities they serve is strained, making it difficult to police effectively. \u201cOur investigation found that these stressors can, and do, play out in harmful ways for CPD officers,\u201d the report stated. \u201cCPD deals with officer alcoholism, domestic violence and suicide. And as explained elsewhere in this Report, CPD officers engage in a pattern or practice of using force that is unjustified, disproportionate and otherwise excessive.\u201d The report continued: \u201cAlthough the pressure CPD officers are under is by no means an excuse for violating the constitutional rights of the citizens they serve, high levels of unaddressed stress can compromise officer well-being and impact an officer\u2019s demeanor and judgment, which in turn impacts how that officer interacts with the public.\u201d The report said Chicago officers need greater support from both the police department\u2019s leadership as well as the city, adding that both parties \u201cshould think meaningfully about how to better address the stressors\u201d these offices face.

    "text": "A President Who Inspired Big Dreams, and Big Smiles, in a Young Generation Image CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times By and Annie Correal Michelle Yemba, who is 6 years old, often tells strangers about the time two years ago that she met the president of the United States. The conversation started during a surprise visit by President Obama to her Head Start program in Lawrence, Kan. Mr. Obama told Michelle, pictured above, that he knew someone else with the same name \u2014 one of his favorite people, he said, coyly referring to his wife. \u201cHe has just a natural flow with the kids,\u201d said Clara Cox, director of the Head Start program, recounting the visit. One of Mr. Obama\u2019s lasting legacies may be the symbolic impact on the generation for whom \u201cpresident of the United States\u201d has always referred to a black man. Tapping into that at events throughout his two terms, he often seemed to assume the role of national dad \u2014 embracing the children of strangers as if they were his own. Photos of these interactions, in which the president connected with children through poignant\u00a0 head pats \u00a0and\u00a0 playful poses , have been shared widely online. As his administration ends, we look back at some of the young people who met him and how the encounters shaped their lives. Jedi Scott Image CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times At 10 months old, Jedi Scott became known in his neighborhood in Brooklyn as \u201cthe Obama baby.\u201d He had been scooped up by the president-elect the day before the 2009 inauguration at a community service event in Washington. \u201cMichelle, I think we just decided we\u2019re going to take Jedi home,\u201d Mr. Obama said, as the boy\u2019s parents, Jason Scott and Kippy Joseph, looked on. Cameras flashed. The next day, \u201cour phones just exploded,\u201d Mr. Scott said. Their son was on the front page of The New York Times, smiling at Mr. Obama. \u201cI think he realized something special was happening,\u201d Mr. Scott said. Today, Jedi is 8. \u201cWe actually watched the farewell speech with him and our daughter, Kaia,\u201d Ms. Joseph said. \u201cJedi understands the history and the importance of it \u2014 that he was the first African-American president and what that meant to so many people.\u201d \u2018Waiting for Superman\u2019 Students Image CreditDrew Angerer/The New York Times Not long after the release of the education documentary \u201cWaiting for Superman\u201d in 2010, Mr. Obama invited students featured in the film, their families and their teachers to the White House. \u201cI never thought I would ever get to meet someone in such a high position as him,\u201d said Nakia Whitfield, whose daughter Bianca is pictured in the green shirt above, seated in the Oval Office. \u201cAs her mother, I feel honored knowing that my child had a one-in-a-million chance to meet with the first African-American president of the United States of America.\u201d She added: \u201cThis is a moment that will follow her for the rest of her life.\u201d Emily Jones, standing far right, is now a college senior who wants to become a teacher: \u201cHis actions and interests in us show his legacy for the current and next generation of educators. And I will always be grateful for his commitment of advocacy to public education.\u201d Leland Shelton Image CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times Leland Shelton, pictured above center, said he felt some \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d when Mr. Obama held him up as an example for young black men in a May 2013 speech at his graduation from Morehouse College in Atlanta. Mr. Shelton, who was raised with his siblings by their grandmother because their parents were addicted to drugs, was graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Morehouse \u2014 a historically black college \u2014 and went on to graduate from Harvard Law School. The mixed feelings came as the president congratulated Mr. Shelton but also used his story to tell black men not to make excuses for their personal failings. In doing so, Mr. Obama invoked the kind of respectability politics that has often driven a wedge between him and younger generations of black men. Mr. Shelton, who is 25, said he appreciated the shout-out but wished it had come with an acknowledgment of the impacts of systemic racism. \u00a0\u201cI think it was a good move, just to show that beating the odds is not impossible,\u201d Mr. Shelton said. \u201cBut you also want to address the fact that those odds exist.\u201d Daughter of Zion Junior Academy Students Image CreditDamon Winter/The New York Times Waving students from the Daughter of Zion Junior Academy caught Mr. Obama\u2019s eye as his motorcade drove past their school on the way to a campaign event in Delray, Fla., in October 2012, according to Willa Dean Fulmore, the school\u2019s secretary. Not long after, Secret Service agents arrived at the academy and asked administrators to bring the students, most of whom come from low-income homes, to a nearby civic center for an impromptu meeting. Mr. Obama spoke for a few minutes about the importance of studying, especially math, she said, calling the short meeting \u201cthe greatest memory of my life.\u201d Patricia McCoy, who became principal in 2014, said photos of the president\u2019s visit, which hang around the school, inspired her to keep working harder in a job that could be grueling and thankless. \u201cI have days when I think, \u2018God, I can\u2019t do this anymore,\u2019\u201d she said, adding of the visit, \u201cI felt like it was a miracle to jump-start me back up.\u201d Rosalia Kildee Image CreditZach Gibson for The New York Times Rosalia Kildee rode on the White House driveway in her popemobile during a Halloween celebration in 2015 while her father, Brian Kildee, pictured above in sunglasses, acted as her security detail. Her mother, Laura Baptiste, whose head is pictured above on the bottom left, was taking photographs. \u201cAs we approached, President Obama bent down, smiled and started to laugh. Rosalia\u2019s miter cocked back, and the two of them just sort of communed,\u201d Ms. Baptiste said, referring to her headgear. \u201cFor the moments that we were there with the Obamas, it didn\u2019t seem like we were with the president and first lady of the United States. They were just two people in their sneakers, hanging out on their front porch and handing out candy to little kids.\u201d Joey Hudy Image CreditStephen Crowley/The New York Times Shooting the contents of a mechanical pencil across a classroom out of a Gatorade bottle would land most students in detention. But Joey Hudy\u2019s experiment inspired a marshmallow cannon that he eventually fired at a White House science fair in 2012. Joey was shy and said he had no friends, according to a profile published by Arizona State University , before attending an inventors event that preceded his White House visit. He has gone on to speak publicly across the world at events for young inventors, sit in the first lady\u2019s box at the State of the Union address in 2014 and get hired at 16 as an intern at Intel. He enrolled at Arizona State University but took a job in China, according to his blog . College Heights Early Childhood Learning Center Students Image CreditStephen Crowley/The New York Times Shortly after his second term began, Mr. Obama visited Lauren Parks\u2019s prekindergarten class at the College Heights Early Childhood Learning Center in Decatur, Ga. \u201cTo witness President Obama persevere in placing such high importance on children and education affirms my work as a teacher,\u201d Ms. Parks, pictured top right, said this week. \u00a0\u201cThe few minutes I had to speak with him in the hallway before inviting him into my classroom made such an impact on me. I saw him express genuine excitement to meet my diverse, effervescent, curious, wonderful students. My students and I helped the president show to others why we matter.\u201d Mari Copeny CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times Mari Copeny, 9, is known as Little Miss Flint. Long before she met the president in Flint, Mich. , last year, she was a fan, said her mother, LuLu Brezzell. As a baby, \u201cwhen she would see him on TV, she would say: \u2018Bama! Bama! Bama!\u2019\u201d \u201cWhen the water crisis made headlines, Mari got really focused,\u201d Ms. Brezzell said. \u201cShe wanted the world to know what was going on. But she didn\u2019t know how, because how do you get the world to listen to you when you\u2019re a kid?\u201d With her mother\u2019s help, Mari wrote a letter to Mr. Obama , and went to Washington for a Flint hearing on Capitol Hill. A month and a half later, they got a call from the White House. The president had read Mari's letter and was coming to Flint. When the day came, Ms. Brezzell recalled, \u201cWe\u2019re standing there, waiting, and Mari\u2019s literally shaking. \u2018What if he doesn\u2019t like me? Is he going to be nice?\u2019 And the minute he appeared she broke free from me and ran straight into his arms. He asked Mari if she had missed school, and she said yes. He said, \u2018Well, you better do your homework!\u2019\u201d \u201cThe whole experience was just so heartwarming,\u201d Ms. Brezzell said. \u201cOf course Mari is like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s my president. He\u2019s a good guy. I can do that, too.\u2019 She made me do that math for her: The year she can legally run for president is 2044. He\u2019s inspired her so much that that\u2019s what she wants to do.\u201d What's Next ",

REUTERS/Ahmed Saad Email MOSUL, Iraq -- Iraqi forces have won a string of swift territorial gains in Mosul in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) after months of slow progress. Government troops retook the eastern edge of a third bridge in Mosul Saturday and a cluster of buildings inside Mosul University, according to a senior Iraqi officer overseeing the operation.\u00a0 60 Minutes cameras were rolling when an Iraqi soldier announced an ISIS car bomber was heading toward their base in East Mosul Iraqi forces now control the eastern sides of three of the city\u2019s five bridges that span the Tigris river connecting Mosul\u2019s east to west. Warplanes from the U.S.-led coalition bombed the city\u2019s bridges late last year in an effort to isolate ISIS fighters in the city\u2019s east by disrupting resupply routes. At Mosul University, senior commanders said that Iraqi forces have secured more than half of the campus Saturday amid stiff resistance, but clashes were ongoing into the afternoon. Iraqi forces entered the university from the southeast Friday morning and by nightfall had secured a handful of buildings, Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil and Lt. Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi said on a tour of the university Saturday. \u201cWe watched all the (ISIS) fighters gather in that building, so we blew it up,\u201d said special forces Sgt. Maj. Haytham Ghani pointing to one of the blackened technical college buildings where charred desks could be seen inside. \u201cYou can still see some of their corpses,\u201d he added.\u00a0 The interior of a burnt building of the University of Mosul is seen during a battle with Islamic State or Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants, in Mosul, Iraq, Jan. 14, 2017. REUTERS/Ahmed Saad Thick clouds of black smoke rose from the middle of the sprawling complex Saturday morning. By afternoon, clashes had intensified with volleys of sniper and mortar fire targeting the advancing Iraqi forces. Convoys of Iraqi Humvees snaked through the campus, pausing for artillery and airstrikes to clear snipers perched within classrooms, dormitories and behind the trees that line the campus streets. As Iraqi forces have closed in on the Tigris river that roughly divides Mosul into eastern and western halves, their pace has quickened. ISIS defenses in the city\u2019s east appear to be thinning and unlike in the surrounding neighborhoods, Iraqi officers said they believe Mosul University and recently retaken government buildings are largely empty of civilians  -- allowing them to use air cover more liberally. Iraqi soldiers at Mosul University said while they were still coming under heavy small arms fire, ISIS resistance was significantly less than they faced during the first weeks of the Mosul operation.\u00a0 ",

Most are Chinese and many are women. The International Butler Academy China opened in 2014 here in Chengdu, a haze-covered city in southwest China, and offers a six-week boot camp on dinner service, managing homes and other minutiae of high living. Photo A student uses a ruler to set the cutlery on the table for a formal dinner. Credit Gilles Sabri\u00e9 for The New York Times \u201cThe Chinese are vacationing more now than ever in history, and so they\u2019re being exposed to the West more and more,\u201d said Christopher Noble, an American trainer at the academy who previously ran bars in Cleveland . \u201cBut Chinese people see that, experience top-class personal service abroad, and they want to experience it here.\u201d A boom in butler service might seem incongruous as President Xi Jinping campaigns zealously against corruption and extravagance , and an economic slowdown undercuts lavish spending. But China\u2019s rich continue amassing ever greater fortunes and want what they see as the trappings of respectable refinement. Even under Mr. Xi, butlers are finding growing work as symbols of good taste, according to people in the business. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cYou read about an economic slowdown, but China\u2019s wealth is still growing,\u201d said Luo Jinhuan, who has worked as a butler in Shanghai and, most recently, Beijing, after learning the job in Holland. \u201cOld money has passed from one generation to the next. But the new money doesn\u2019t have the same quality. You need to help them improve.\u201d If butlers symbolize maturing Chinese capitalism, the somewhat awkward status they have here also reflects how the rich in China must play by different rules than the wealthy in many other countries. It often comes down to a lack of trust. Wealth in China, where a cutthroat business culture is pervasive, comes with insecurity about being brought low by resentful employees, rivals, and officials, especially with the continuing crackdown against corruption. That wariness discourages many millionaires from hiring their own Jeeves to run their homes, people in the business said. \u201cSome of them discover that in reality they can\u2019t trust an outsider to manage the household,\u201d said Tang Yang, a marketing director at the butler academy. \u201cThey\u2019re unwilling to have a butler who knows all the information about the family.\u201d Photo Xu Shitao, center, with fellow students waiting to serve a dish of fried salmon during an exam dinner. \u201cI only began to grasp this profession of butlers after watching \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019\u201d Ms. Xu saId. Credit Gilles Sabrie for The New York Times Relatively few graduates of the academy end up as traditional household butlers. Instead, many work in high-end clubs, housing estates and executive floors, serving several clients at the same time \u2014 not with the same intimacy as a personal butler. Promoters of butlers in China often point out that the country has its own tradition of high-end service, and the classical Chinese novel, \u201cDream of the Red Chamber,\u201d features traditional butlers, called \u201cguanjia,\u201d or \u201cdomestic manager,\u201d in Mandarin. But \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d helped rekindle a new romanticized interest in old-school service in China. Many student butlers here said they had watched and rewatched the show as an instruction video on the self-effacing unflappability of domestic service. \u201cI only began to grasp this profession of butlers after watching \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019\u201d said Xu Shitao, a 34-year-old Beijing native studying at the Chengdu academy. \u201cI think that in the future this profession will be quite popular and will have a market.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Ms. Xu and her classmates have found that, in reality, being a butler is strenuous work. On a recent morning, they practiced for hours, learning to serve wine and water the proper way. Again and again, the class of eight clasped a wine bottle near its bottom and stepped forward in unison around a dinner table to dispense just enough wine to reach the widest part of a wine glass. Not a drop was to splash the tablecloth or, heaven forbid, a guest. \u201cStretch, pour, up, twist, back, wipe. Try to extend your arm,\u201d Mr. Noble commanded, using his ever-present translator. \u201cYou want to be able to extend your arm as much as possible. You\u2019re doing a ballet.\u201d Photo Christopher Noble, a senior instructor, keeps watch as Sun Qian pours champagne during an exam dinner. Credit Gilles Sabrie for The New York Times Students also take classes on serving formal dinners, packing luggage, cleaning house and countless other details of managing life for the rich. \u201cYou have to get the details right to do your job right,\u201d said Yang Linjun, a 22-year-old student in the class. \u201cYour arms get sore and your hands hurt, but this is a lifestyle.\u201d After they graduate, many hope to attach themselves to China\u2019s growing number of superrich. In return, they may earn monthly wages of $2,800 or much higher as personal butlers, depending on experience and luck \u2014 more than for many service jobs. By 2015, China had 400 billionaires and billionaire families, an increase of 65 from just a year earlier, according to Forbes\u2019 annual list . The country\u2019s richest 1 percent own about one-third of household wealth, a share similar to the concentration of wealth in America. Manners can be rough in China, sometimes in a warm way, sometimes less so. But that has been changing as people grow richer, travel and live abroad, and bring back a demand for polished, attentive service. \u201cA decade ago, very few Chinese people stayed in five-star hotels,\u201d said Yang Kaojun, a property manager with the Summit Group , which employs teams of trained butlers who are at the beck and call of residents. \u201cBut now many people have, and that\u2019s given them some understanding of what good service is.\u201d Photo Zhang Tianming watches as fellow students seat guests for an exam dinner. Credit Gilles Sabri\u00e9 for The New York Times As well as the Chengdu academy, the Sanda University, a private college in Shanghai, has incorporated butler training into its hospitality program. Many Chinese also learn how to be butlers in Europe. And Sara Vestin Rahmani, the founder of the Bespoke Bureau, a British company that finds domestic staff members for wealthy employers, said her company planned to open a school for butlers and domestic staff people in China this year. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The number of butlers in China is hard to determine. There may be hundreds or thousands, especially in Beijing, Shanghai and the prosperous south. Ms. Rahmani said that in 2007 her company found positions in China for 20 butlers; by 2015 that number had grown to 375, including 125 with families. Others reported similar growth. \u201cWe are in actual fact exporting to China a trade which was once their own,\u201d Ms. Rahmani said. \u201cWith communism, everything that was refined, unique and upper-class became a distant memory.\u201d But Chinese employers often treat butlers as expensive all-purpose flunkies who should be on call 24 hours a day. That violated the traditional idea of a butler as a respected manager of the household and above most menial tasks. Ms. Luo, the butler, said her work was far more hectic than she imagined. Her daily routine included overseeing the sauna, cinema, bowling alley and other rooms in a 32,000-square-foot home. \u201cI feel that when work starts, there\u2019s no time at all to stop and rest,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder than working in a hotel.\u201d The pressure is compounded by employers\u2019 fears that household servants could exploit sensitive information. Butlers are supposed to have a deep knowledge of their employers\u2019 every foible, traditionally recorded in a book. But the worry that information could be used to rob, extort or prosecute them has discouraged many rich people from taking butlers into their confidence. \u201cMany of our wealthy are the first generation to be rich, and they don\u2019t have a long accumulation of family history,\u201d said Mr. Yang, the student at the butler academy in Chengdu, who works for a real estate company. \u201cYou need trust and a long period of adjustment to have another person suddenly by your side.\u201d ",

    "text": "Jan 14 2017, 1:38 pm ET Jennifer Holliday Backs Out of Trump Inauguration Performance by Associated Press advertisement Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump. Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's \"Dreamgirls,\" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial. Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans. Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert. Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap ; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press. \"My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!\" she wrote. \"Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,\" she added. \"You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.\" Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration. \"I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,\" Holliday told the AP. The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in \"The Color Purple,\" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her \"Uncle Tom\" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life. \"It just really made my heart drop to my feet,\" Holliday said. \"How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.\" Holliday was to perform at the \"Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself. The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars. Associated Press ",

John Lewis, D-Ga., center, takes a seat at the witness table on Capitol Hill in Washington. \u00a0(AP) A growing number of Democrats, Hollywood celebrities and some Republicans came to the defense of civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis amid fallout from Donald Trump's comments earlier on Saturday. Trump said that Lewis, who has argued the president-elect won't be a legitimate leader, should focus more on fixing his Georgia district. \u201cLewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart,\u201d Trump tweeted. The response on Twitter was swift. GOP Sen. Ben Sassse of Nebraska tweeted that \"John Lewis and his \"talk\" have changed the world.\"\u00a0 On this Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, let it be clear that John Lewis is an American patriot. Trump's attacks on him further confirm it. pic.twitter.com/WavPT36Atu \u2014 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) January 14, 2017 It's telling, I'm afraid, that Donald Trump treats Vladimir Putin with more respect than he does John Lewis. \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) January 14, 2017 Trump assumes John Lewis represents a poor district that's \"falling apart\" simply because he is black. Textbook definition of racism. https://t.co/3Vi93Oq9T2 \u2014 Guy Cecil (@guycecil) January 14, 2017 Cowardly @realDonaldTrump isn't fit to polish hero @repjohnlewis 's boots. \u2014 Yvette D. Clarke (@RepYvetteClarke) January 14, 2017 My friend @repjohnlewis is an American hero. A champion for justice and reconciliation. @realDonaldTrump could learn smth from his example \u2014 Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) January 14, 2017 Residents of Lewis' district in Atlanta, meanwhile, in response to a tweet from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , began to post pictures of their neighborhoods on Twitter -- many of which did not fit with Trump's characterization.\u00a0 @ajc I live in the #fifthdistrict and couldn't be prouder to cast my vote for @repjohnlewis ! pic.twitter.com/Vbu1H4u40H \u2014 Tim Truxell (@flannelenigma) January 14, 2017 Lewis, a leader in the civil rights movement of the 1960s who was beaten by state troopers during the \"Bloody Sunday\" march from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama, says in an NBC's \"Meet the Press\" to air Sunday that he does not consider Trump a \"legitimate president,\" and blamed the Russians for helping the Republican win the White House. \"You know, I believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It's going to be very difficult. I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\" Lewis said. Trump, in followup tweet Saturday, said Lewis should spend more time helping his \"crime invested\" district, instead of \"falsely complaining about the election results.\" \"All talk, talk, talk -- no action or results. Sad.\" Trump concluded.\u00a0 Lewsi has said he will skip next week's inauguration of Trump at the Capitol, joining several other Democrats who have decided to boycott the historic event. \"I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton,\" Lewis said. The Lewis-Trump fued escalted on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. U.S. Intelligence agencies have said Russia meddled in the election to help Trump win. After spending weeks challenging that assessment, Trump finally accepted that the Russians were behind the election-year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. However, he also emphasized that \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\" Lewis explained his decision to stay away from the inauguration as \"you cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.\" He said it will be the first inauguration he has missed in three decades, a time that includes Democrats and Republicans taking the oath of office. Other Democratic lawmakers who have announced plans to skip the inauguration include Reps. Barbara Lee of California, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Luis Gutierrez of Illinois. They cite an array of reasons, but have one at least one thing in common. All represent heavily Democratic districts. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Afterward, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, called the tenor of the exchanges \u201ccontentious at times.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into the contents of what were discussed,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. But \u201ca great many members are concerned with whether the director has employed a double standard.\u201d The hearing took place a day after the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general said it was investigating Mr. Comey\u2019s decision during the campaign to hold a news conference announcing the end of the case \u2014 and then, just before the election, inform Congress there was possible new evidence only to say days later that it did not amount to anything. Mr. Comey \u201cdidn\u2019t really answer,\u201d said Representative Jerold Nadler of New York. He dismissively referred to Mr. Comey as \u201ca policeman,\u201d and added, \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything substantive he said.\u201d The reaction to the assessment by intelligence agencies that Russia sought to promote the candidacy of Donald J. Trump has been mixed. Mr. Trump has seen it as undermining his electoral victory and ridiculed the agencies, accusing them this week of using leaks to discredit him after it briefed him on a dossier of unsubstantiated reports of compromising personal information the Russians allegedly collected. But on Friday, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and the panel\u2019s vice chairman, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, announced that the committee would hold hearings on the Russian activity and its effect on the election. Before Russians were an issue, there was the F.B.I. investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton or her aides mishandled classified information that was in emails on a private server she was using. Mr. Comey discussed the investigation and sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton at a news conference announcing that no charges would be brought against her. He also wrote two letters near the end of the campaign that Clinton supporters say cost her the election. But Mr. Comey has not publicly commented on whether there are any open investigations of Mr. Trump or anyone associated with his campaign. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Democrats said the closest Mr. Comey came on Friday to offering an explanation for his actions was to say he would only disclose an ongoing investigation if the public had an overwhelming need to know about it or if it was obvious there was one underway. He said he did not believe any possible investigation into Trump or his associates met either standard. The F.B.I.\u2019s position is that it does not discuss counterintelligence investigations that could compromise important methods and sources. Speaking to reporters afterward, Ms. Pelosi said that \u201creally, the American people are owed the truth.\u201d \u201cThere is a great deal of evidence to say that this is an issue of high interest to the American people,\u201d she continued. \u201cFor that reason, the F.B.I. should let us know whether they\u2019re doing that investigation or not. They\u2019re usually inscrutable.\u201d The F.B.I. declined to comment on the meeting. Mr. Nadler said he thought Mr. Comey should have been fired \u201cmonths ago.\u201d Other Democrats, perhaps concerned about who Mr. Trump would name to replace Mr. Comey, either said that he should remain on the job or that they were still unsure. The meeting in the auditorium of the Capitol\u2019s visitor center was standing room only. Some Republicans unsurprisingly had a different reaction. \u201cTheir questions and comments seemed to make the case that Hillary Clinton would be president if it were not for hacking,\u201d Representative Steve King of Iowa said. Mr. King left the meeting unconvinced about the Russian hacking, which the intelligence chiefs did manage to discuss amid the questions about Mr. Comey\u2019s conduct. The congressman added that he thought \u201csome\u201d intelligence officials were trustworthy. But \u201cnot all. People there need to be rooted out,\u201d he said without elaborating.

They are bitter, disbelieving, hopeful of some kind of eleventh-hour reprieve, perhaps from President-elect Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cFor us, after so much travel through so many countries, it\u2019s very difficult because we are on the verge of attaining what we all wished for,\u201d said Osmani Rodriguez, who was among the Cubans protesting here Friday in front of the offices of Mexico\u2019s National Migration Institute. \u201cNow we don\u2019t know where we stand,\u201d added Rodriguez, formerly a driver in Cuba, who said he had been on the road for six months. One after another, they recounted tales of their perilous journeys \u2014 of navigating the Darien Gap, a notoriously dense stretch of jungle on the Panamanian\u00a0border, on foot. Of\u00a0facing organized bands of ripoff artists in places as far flung as Brazil, Peru and Nicaragua. Of crossing borders illicitly\u00a0in the dark of night. Of being broke and hungry on foreign soil, imploring relatives in the United States via cellphone to wire more dollars right away. Most said they had used up all their savings and even sold their homes; many owe\u00a0thousands of dollars to relatives and friends\u00a0who bankrolled their odysseys. Now they wonder: Was it all for naught? \u201cWe have nothing left in Cuba,\u201d said Luis Gonzalez Pulido, another Cuban who took to the streets here. \u201cWe don\u2019t have homes\u00a0anymore. We have problems with authorities there. All we wanted was to reach the United States, nothing more. Why can\u2019t they just let us through?\u201d That now appears highly unlikely. Apart from going home \u2014 a choice most seem to reject \u2014 U.S.-bound Cubans lacking visas would seem to have one main option: continuing\u00a0their journeys north to the U.S.-Mexico border and\u00a0getting in line with the multitudes, hopeful of navigating that ever more-imposing barrier to the long-cherished American Dream.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The Chargers are moving \u00a0to L.A., Obama's legacy: \u00a0part 1, California\u2019s drought conditions \u00a0have improved in the northern part of the state, and Sean McVay, the new Los Angeles Rams coach , becomes the youngest NFL head coach in modern history.

    "text": "WATCH Cabinet Picks Who Broke With Trump's Policy Positions 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump unleashed a Twitter attack on Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis, after the lawmaker said he wouldn't attend Trump's inauguration because he doesn't see him as a \"legitimate president.\" Lewis in an interview with NBC on Friday cited Russia's meddling in the election for his view on the legitimacy of the presidential election results, and his comments stoked controversy with Republicans and debate inside the Democratic Party . \"I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\" Lewis said. Trump hit back, slamming Lewis today for \"falsely complaining about the election,\" and called him \"all talk, talk, talk -- no action or results!\" Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 Trump\u2019s tweets spurred a backlash on social media, including by some who said Trump was dismissing Lewis' accomplishments in the struggle for civil rights on the weekend before Martin Luther King Jr. Day . Lewis himself responded to Trump today in a DNC fundraising email in which he said, \"I've been beaten bloody, tear-gassed, fighting for what's right for America. I've marched at Selma with Dr. King. Sometimes that's what it takes to move our country in the right direction.\" Lewis is one of the last surviving central organizing figures of the U.S. civil rights movement and was beat by police in a march for voting rights on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama . John Lewis is an icon of the Civil Rights Movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality. He deserves better than this. https://t.co/WX1QDCKfzP \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 14, 2017 . @repjohnlewis knows true sacrifice. @realDonaldTrump has no clue. When cluelessness collides with power oppression results. Resistance! https://t.co/Eu1vWbetsl \u2014 Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) January 14, 2017 Ahead of #MLKday2017 , let us remember that many have tried to silence @repjohnlewis over the years. All have failed. \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) January 14, 2017 Some other critics complained about the president-elect calling Lewis' congressional district in Georgia \" crime infested\" and \"falling apart.\" Lewis has represented his district since 1986, and it includes some of the more affluent areas around Atlanta. It is home to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several Fortune 500 companies, and well-known universities and colleges including Emory University, Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Georgia Tech and Georgia State University, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Some of the questions are those that should be asked by a new administration seeking to come to grips with the hows and whys behind longstanding American national security and foreign assistance policies. But it is difficult to know whether the probing, critical tone of other questions indicates that significant policy changes should be expected. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On terrorism, the document asks why the United States is even bothering to fight the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria, why all of the schoolgirls kidnapped by the group have not been rescued and whether Qaeda operatives from Africa are living in the United States. And it questions the effectiveness of one of the more significant counterterrorism efforts on the continent. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting al-Shabaab for a decade, why haven\u2019t we won?\u201d poses one question, referring to the terrorist group based in Somalia that was behind the Westgate mall attacks in Kenya in 2013. Although the document represents a first look at how the new administration might approach policy toward Africa, a subject that was rarely touched on during the campaign, officials with the Trump transition team did not respond to queries about the list. \u201cMany of the questions that they are asking are the right questions that any incoming administration should ask,\u201d said Monde Muyangwa, the director of the Africa program at the Woodrow Wilson Institute. But she also noted that \u201cthe framing of some of their questions suggests a narrower definition of U.S. interests in Africa, and a more transactional and short-term approach to policy and engagement with African countries.\u201d Ms. Muyangwa said the queries could signal \u201ca dramatic turn in how the United States will engage with the continent.\u201d J. Peter Pham, who has been mentioned for the job of assistant secretary of state for African affairs in a Trump administration, said he does not expect Mr. Trump to do a complete U-turn in relations with Africa. Mr. Pham, director of the Africa program at the Atlantic Council, said he expects Mr. Trump will emphasize fighting extremism on the continent, while also looking to enhance opportunities for American businesses. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In other questions, the Trump transition team challenges the benefits of a trade pact known as the African Growth and Opportunity Act. \u201cMost of AGOA imports are petroleum products, with the benefits going to national oil companies, why do we support that massive benefit to corrupt regimes?\u201d the questionnaire asks. Yet Mr. Pham said he expected a Trump administration would support the pact. \u201cAGOA has created more than 120,000 jobs in the United States,\u201d Mr. Pham said in an interview. A big unknown, though, is how a Trump administration will handle foreign assistance to the continent and its 54 nations. President George W. Bush quadrupled foreign assistance levels to African countries, and President Obama largely maintained that, even as his administration was making cuts elsewhere. Even so, the amount of American aid in 2015 to other critical allies \u2014 Afghanistan ($5.5 billion), Israel ($3.1 billion), Iraq ($1.8 billion) and Egypt ($1.4 billion) \u2014 far exceeded the approximately $8 billion for all of sub-Saharan Africa. The questions seem to reflect the inaccurate view shared by many Americans about how much the United States spends on foreign aid and global health programs. Polls show that Americans believe the country spends 25 percent of its budget on foreign aid \u2014 but the truth is that foreign aid is just 1 percent of the federal budget . \u201cWe\u2019ve been hunting Kony for years, is it worth the effort?\u201d poses another series of questions related to Joseph Kony , the warlord head of Uganda\u2019s violent guerrilla group the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, who has eluded the authorities for three decades. \u201cThe LRA has never attacked U.S. interests, why do we care? Is it worth the huge cash outlays? I hear that even the Ugandans are looking to stop searching for him, since they no longer view him as a threat, so why do we?\u201d The hunt for Mr. Kony and his fighters has generated a huge amount of publicity around the world, in large part because of a video on his elusiveness and brutality, \u201cKony 2012,\u201d that has been viewed more than 100 million times on YouTube. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But other questions, foreign policy experts say, return to a theme of a continent that has squandered American money and effort. The questions challenge, for instance, a hallmark of Mr. Bush\u2019s Africa policy \u2014 the Pepfar program, which has provided billions to fight AIDS and tuberculosis in Africa. Rex W. Tillerson , Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, complimented the program, calling Pepfar \u201cone of the most extraordinarily successful programs in Africa\u201d during his Senate nomination hearing. But, in contrast, the Trump transition questionnaire asks, \u201cIs PEPFAR worth the massive investment when there are so many security concerns in Africa? Is PEPFAR becoming a massive, international entitlement program?\u201d J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the questions showed an \u201coverwhelmingly negative and disparaging outlook\u201d on the continent. \u201cA strange attitude runs through this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of recurrent skepticism that Africa matters to U.S. interests at all. It\u2019s entirely negative in orientation.\u201d But the questions do appear to accurately reflect what Mr. Trump has said publicly about Africa in the few times that he has mentioned the continent. For instance, during the Ebola crisis in 2014, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to argue that Americans infected with Ebola should not be allowed back into the United States. As two American health workers became critically ill and were airlifted to Atlanta for treatment, Mr. Trump had this to say via Twitter: \u201cStop the EBOLA patients from entering the U.S. Treat them, at the highest level, over there. THE UNITED STATES HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS!\u201d The Ebola epidemic, which killed almost 10,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia (but no Americans), comes up once in the document. \u201cHow,\u201d the questionnaire asks, \u201cdo we prevent the next Ebola outbreak from hitting the U.S.?\u201d Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .

Born when a Qing dynasty emperor was on the throne, he went on to help invent the Pinyin writing system used for transliterating the Chinese alphabet. Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images Zhou Youguang sits at home in Beijing, in 2015. Born when a Qing dynasty emperor was on the throne, he went on to help invent the Pinyin writing system used for transliterating the Chinese alphabet. Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images Zhou Youguang, the inventor of a system to convert Chinese characters into words with the Roman alphabet, died Saturday at the age of 111. Since his system was introduced nearly six decades ago, few innovations have done more to boost literacy rates in China and bridge the divide between the country and the West. Pinyin, which was adopted by China in 1958, gave readers unfamiliar with Chinese characters a crucial tool to understand how to pronounce them. These characters do not readily disclose information on how to say them aloud \u2014 but with such a system as Pinyin, those characters more easily and clearly yield their meaning when converted into languages like English and Spanish, which use the Roman alphabet. At 105, Chinese Linguist Now A Government Critic While it was not the first system to Romanize Chinese, Pinyin has become the most widely accepted. For Chinese speakers, many of whom speak disparate dialects, its broad acceptance made education easier, giving instructors a single, relatively simple instrument to teach people how to read. Beyond China's borders, Pinyin allowed the standardization of Chinese names. For instance, it's a big reason why the name Westerners commonly use for the Chinese capital shifted from \"Peking\" to \"Beijing.\" And it's why many other such names changed dramatically along with it. And yet Zhou, the man behind one of the most important linguistic innovations in the 20th century, said he was reluctant when asked by the Chinese government to take on the task in the mid-1950s. At the time, he was an economic scholar, only recently returned to China after a stint working on Wall Street in the U.S. He had come back to the country after its 1949 Communist revolution. Article continues after sponsorship \"I said I was an amateur, a layman, I couldn't do the job,\" he told NPR in 2011 , laughing. \"But they said, it's a new job, everybody is an amateur. Everybody urged me to change professions, so I did. So from 1955, I abandoned economics and started studying writing systems.\" Zhou (shown here in New York in 1947) worked on Wall Street, but he returned to China in 1949 after the Communist revolution. Less than a decade after this photo was taken, he went to work on the system that would become Pinyin. Courtesy Zhou Youguang hide caption toggle caption Courtesy Zhou Youguang The committee Zhou led spent three years working on its alphabetic system. \"People made fun of us, joking that it had taken us a long time to deal with just 26 letters,\" he told the BBC in 2012. Others took the committee's invention very seriously, however. The Communist government of China introduced Pinyin in schools in 1958. The international community eventually adopted it as the standard romanization for Chinese writing, as well, with the U.N. doing so in 1986. Before Pinyin, 85 percent of Chinese people could not read, according to the BBC. Now, UNICEF says the literacy rate in China hovers at about 95 percent. Lately, Pinyin has also been integral in determining the ways mobile phones and computers transmit Chinese characters. Still, despite the broad acceptance of his system, Zhou went on to become something of a thorn in the side of the country's Communist government. During the Cultural Revolution, in the '60s and '70s, Zhou drew the scrutiny of the Communist Party. In 1969, he was even labeled a \"reactionary academic authority\" and exiled to a labor camp for more than two years, reports The New York Times . But he was not dissuaded from speaking his mind for long. As he aged, he became more vocal about his dissatisfaction with the powers that be. And, as Louisa Lim noted for NPR, Zhou was not afraid to use his stature to point out discrepancies he found in Communist Party doctrine. \"In 1985, he translated the Encyclopaedia Britannica into Chinese and then worked on the second edition \u2014 placing him in a position to notice the U-turns in China's official line. At the time of the original translation, China's position was that the U.S. started the Korean War \u2014 but the encyclopedia said North Korea was to blame, Zhou recalls. \" 'That was troublesome, so we didn't include that bit. Later, the Chinese view changed. So we got permission from above to include it. That shows there's progress in China,' he says, adding, 'But it's too slow.' \" For a man born in 1906, under China's final dynasty, Zhou did more than most to help encourage the change he wished to see in his country. Though he died Saturday after more than a century of life, he is survived by the system he helped father, which continues to live on around the world. Clarification: This post has been updated to make clearer the fact that Pinyin was not the first system of Romanization. ",

Questioned by the Wall Street Journal about the sanctions on Russia implemented by the Obama administration last month , Mr. Trump said he could nix them if the foreign power was to assist the U.S. in fighting terrorists or in other ways. \u201cIf you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody\u2019s doing some really great things?\u201d he said in the Journal interview. But Mr. Trump said he plans to keep the sanctions -- the latest of which were a response to the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that the Kremlin directed hacks during the U.S. election -- in place for \u201cat least a period of time.\u201d CBS News has confirmed FBI Director James Comey personally briefed President-elect Donald Trump about unverified claims that the Russians have co... The president-elect acknowledged that Vladimir Putin has expressed interest in meeting with him after he takes office, and Mr. Trump said \u201cthat\u2019s absolutely fine with me.\u201d Mr. Trump seemed to concede this week that Russia was behind the extensive cyberattacks on Democratic Party officials, telling reporters that \u201cas far as hacking, I think it was Russia.\u201d But, he seemed to dismiss the import of Moscow\u2019s actions, saying in his first press conference since the election that \u201cI also think we\u2019ve been hacked by other countries, other people.\u201d In the Journal\u2019s wide-ranging interview, Mr. Trump also suggested that he was open to scrapping the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, in which the U.S. recognizes the island nation of Taiwan as a part of \u201cone China.\u201d When asked about the policy, Mr. Trump said \u201ceverything is under negotiation, including One China.\u201d On Saturday, China\u2019s foreign ministry seemed to push back on the assessment, posting on its website that the \u201cOne China\u201d principle was a non-negotiable political basis for China-U.S. relations. It also pushed \u201crelevant parties\u201d in the U.S. to recognize the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue. Since 1979, the United States has recognized Taiwan as a territory of China\u2019s and not a sovereign nation, but in December, Mr. Trump broke protocol by taking a phone call with its president. China launched a diplomatic protest in response.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Gen. William J. Walker, Maj. Gen. Errol R. Schwartz, Maj. Gen. Bradley A. Becker and Brig. Gen. George M. Degnon during a news conference on Dec. 14 at the District of Columbia National Guard armory in Washington. (Bill O'Leary / The Washington Post) Peter Hermann, Dan LamotheThe Washington Post The transition team for President-elect Donald Trump asked the head of the District of Columbia National Guard to remain in command throughout Inauguration Day after media reports that he would leave in the middle of the ceremony created controversy, the Guard said. Maj. Gen. Errol Schwartz told The Washington Post on Friday that he will be removed from his post immediately after Trump is sworn in as president. That irked at least one D.C. Council member because Schwartz will have to abandon his post during one of the Guard's most important operations, helping maintain security and order during Washington's highest-profile event. As is customary for presidential appointees, Schwartz had offered his resignation after Trump was elected. In an interview Friday, Schwartz said he learned he would be replaced on Jan. 20. He said the transition team ultimately asked him to stay in the job for a few additional days, but only after the report of his departure had been published Friday on The Washington Post website. Schwartz said he turned down the transition team's offer because, by then, he had begun packing up his office and notified his staff. He said he believes the offer came only as a result of the negative attention his departure attracted. He declined to comment further. Transition officials for the new administration on Friday said the team asked Schwartz to stay on through the inauguration to maintain continuity. They did not immediately respond Saturday to questions about when and how that offer was extended. Military officials on Saturday backtracked from earlier statements indicating that Schwartz had not been asked to stay on by the new administration. One said he learned he had been mistaken, and that additional paperwork that became available Saturday showed that the transition team had in fact asked Schwartz to maintain his command for several days into the new presidency. That official did not know when that offer was made. ",

By Paul Kane January 14 at 3:46 PM Follow @pkcapitol Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) knew that Democrats had set a trap, asking if he would support using torture against suspected terrorists. \u201cI will always comply with the law,\u201d Pompeo, the nominee to be CIA director, told senators Thursday. With that and several other deft answers, Pompeo defused a potential land mine during his Senate confirmation hearing and now is well on his way to swift confirmation. The day before, during his own confirmation hearing to be secretary of state, Rex Tillerson stumbled into the most basic of pitfalls, falling over a six-word question: Is Vladi\u00admir Putin a war criminal? \u201cI would not use that term,\u201d Tillerson responded. 1 of 51 See photos from the confirmation hearings of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees View Photos The Senate is getting an early start on the president-elect\u2019s choices for several top jobs in his administration. Caption The Senate is getting an early start on the president-elect\u2019s choices for several top jobs in his administration. Jan. 12, 2017\u00a0 Ben Carson, the nominee to be the Housing and Urban Development secretary, pauses while answering questions from the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Tillerson went on to endure a rocky hearing and, while his nomination is still very much alive, the former ExxonMobil chief executive will now have to answer a lengthy list of follow-up questions from senators left underwhelmed by his performance. Tillerson might now need a couple more weeks to convince several Republican national security hawks that he is the right man to be the nation\u2019s top diplomat at time when relations with Russia are at the forefront. The two nominees to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet handled things very differently, serving as useful examples to future nominees for what to do \u2014 and what not to do \u2014 when trying to join one of the most controversial administrations in modern presidential history. They demonstrated how to avoid trouble (or walk into it) and how to cater to senatorial ego (or to infuriate it). By and large, Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees performed well over the past week. Sometimes they gave firm commitments to uphold the law \u2014 always a smart play in confirmation hearings because the senators, after all, make the laws \u2014 and sometimes they paid the right compliment. Most insiders believe that the Senate will confirm at least four, maybe more, of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees after the president-elect is sworn in Friday afternoon. Three are likely to come from the national security arena: Pompeo at CIA and two retired generals, James N. Mattis to be secretary of defense and John F. Kelly to be homeland security secretary. Additionally, Elaine Chao\u2019s nomination to be transportation secretary is certain to come on Trump\u2019s first day in office, given that Democrats know her well as the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). However, some of the more politically treacherous showdowns are still to come for Trump\u2019s nominees: Betsy DeVos for education secretary on Tuesday; Tom Price for health and human services secretary on Wednesday; and Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary on Thursday. Democrats have targeted the vast financial holdings of DeVos and Mnuchin, their business practices and potential conflicts of interest. Like Tillerson, both come from the private sector and have never had to withstand anything like the grilling that comes with a public Senate confirmation hearing. Price (R-Ga.), a 12-year veteran of the House, is facing questions about stock trades he made in the health industry. But just like Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee who emerged mostly unscathed from his confirmation hearing, Price may perform well given he is familiar with the long and sometimes tedious nature of congressional hearings. All of Trump\u2019s nominees are undergoing \u201cmurder boards\u201d inside the presidential transition headquarters in downtown Washington, where a life-size hearing room was constructed well in advance of Election Day to help whichever team won the presidency. Former senators have volunteered to come in and sit behind the committee dais to grill the nominees. Democrats and Republicans can learn from what transpired in the first round of hearings as they prepare for the combative matchups ahead. First and foremost, when in doubt, complimentary comedy is always a good fallback. Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s pick to be secretary of housing and urban development, may be the least qualified of the president-elect\u2019s cabinet selections, even saying so himself not long after Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience; he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d a friend said in November . Some Republicans feared he would wilt under questioning about the intricacies of the sprawling bureaucracy that includes the federal housing system. Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), the top Democrat on the panel, kept peppering Carson with questions until the nominee cut him off \u2014 almost always the wrong thing to do in a confirmation hearing. \u201cYou remind me of \u2018Columbo,\u2019 \u201d Carson deadpanned. The room burst into laughter, with even Brown acknowledging the similarities to the 1970s TV show about the disheveled homicide detective and his own appearance. Carson is now seen as very likely to win confirmation. [ Live from Washington, it\u2019s the Ben Carson hearing ] Every senator should study Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s exchange with Tillerson. The Florida Republican understood the cardinal rule of Senate hearings: Ask short, fast questions \u2014 rather than use the time to make a speech \u2014 to draw as many responses as possible, because nominees run into trouble with their own words. [ The main to watch in Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearing? Rubio ] After Tillerson stumbled over his \u201cwar criminal\u201d question, Rubio read a list of atrocities that the Russian military has been a party to in Syria and other parts of the world. Rubio, one of many Republicans pushing for a tougher policy toward Moscow, asked if Tillerson believed that Putin murdered political opponents. \u201cPeople who speak up for freedom and regimes that are oppressive are often at threat and these things happen to them,\u201d Tillerson responded. \u201cIn terms of assigning specific responsibilities, I would have to have more information.\u201d Rubio has still not said whether he will support Tillerson. Pompeo went in the opposite direction. Democrats tried to draw him out on some of Trump\u2019s more controversial statements, including support for enhanced interrogation techniques that have been outlawed and for sharply criticizing intelligence officials for their conclusions that Russian operatives meddled in the 2016 presidential election. Pompeo told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee that it was \u201cpretty clear\u201d Russia was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email system and called the CIA \u201cthe finest intelligence agency the world has ever known.\u201d That\u2019s why Pompeo will get confirmed long before Tillerson.

Credit Biwa Studio/Getty Images Every Friday, we\u2019ll offer a Trilobite talking point to help you bring a bit more science to your weekend conversations. Earth is old. The sun is old. But do you know what may be even older than both? Water. It\u2019s a mystery how the world became awash in it. But one prevailing theory says that water originated on our planet from ice specks floating in a cosmic cloud before our sun was set ablaze, more than 4.6 billion years ago. As much as half of all the water on Earth may have come from that interstellar gas according to astrophysicists \u2019 calculations . That means the same liquid we drink and that fills the oceans may be millions of years older than the solar system itself. The thinking goes that some of the ancient ice survived the solar system\u2019s chaotic creation and came to Earth. To demonstrate that, researchers analyzed water molecules in oceans for indicators of their ancient past. The clue comes in the form of something known as \u201cheavy water.\u201d Water, as you know, is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. But some water molecules contain hydrogen\u2019s chunky twin, deuterium . (It contains a neutron in its nucleus, whereas regular hydrogen does not.) Photo An illustration of how ancient water in the interstellar cloud drenched the solar system as the sun and planets formed. Credit Bill Saxton, via, National Science Foundation, Associated Universities, Inc, National Radio Astronomy Observatory Deuterium-rich water is found on other planets and moons, even here on Earth, but researchers are not sure where it came from. One idea is that much of the heavy water formed in the interstellar cloud and then traveled across the solar system. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Using a computer model, the scientists showed in a 2014 paper that the billions-of-years-old ice molecules could have survived the sun\u2019s violent radiation blasts, and gone on to bathe a forming Earth and its cousins. They concluded that remnants of that ancient ice remain scattered across the solar system: on the moon, in comets, at Mercury\u2019s poles, in the remains of Mars\u2019 melts, on Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa \u2014 and even in your water bottle. Now that\u2019s something to raise your glass to. Previous Trilobite talking points: Plants will remember if you mess with them enough and yes, you are at the center of the universe. ",

The good news is that with a few precautions, you can avoid these traps. (Photo: iStockphoto) Nearly 100 car sellers on Craigslist were targeted by a scam in the Chicago area that left sellers without their cars and holding rubber checks, the National Insurance Crime Bureau reported last year. In a 2014 case, a young student from Southern California was stabbed to death selling a car he advertised on Craigslist. Selling your car online is a wonderful convenience, but it\u2019s also become a feeding ground for scammers. The good news is that with a few precautions, you can avoid these traps. Craigslist, the free, peer-to-peer classifieds website, is where you\u2019ll find most used car bargains \u2014 and where con artists try to prey on gullible sellers. The online giant eBayMotors.com also lists used cars for sale or auction but has various purchase protection programs to discourage most types of fraud. When asked why online car sales attract shady types, Frank Scafidi, public affairs director of the National Insurance Crime Bureau, answered, \u201cIn a word, \u2018anonymity.\u2019 The internet attracts a lot of positive people, but it also attracts people who try to work their scam and then disappear back into the ether.\u201d Automotive enthusiast Josh Sadlier, a content strategist for Edmunds.com, has been buying and selling cars on Craigslist for years. He says that he\u2019s never had someone try to cheat him but that he\u2019s developed a \u201csixth sense for when someone might be shady.\u201d He adds that if he creates a professional-looking ad with accurate information and good photos, it tends to attract serious, knowledgeable buyers. Despite the occasional, highly publicized crimes involving Craigslist ads, sellers flock to online sites because they want to maximize the value of their used car quickly rather than trading it to a dealer for a lower price. While they may pocket more money, selling online also requires them to meet with strangers and, usually, arrange test drives , exchange cash and sign documents. Auto sales strong as industry nears record high for 2016 Here are five tips to help you avoid falling prey to an online scammer: 1. Profile the buyer. If your buyer is legit \u2014 and reasonable \u2014 the sale will flow smoothly. How can you check out a potential buyer without tapping FBI databases? First, speak with the buyer on the phone. Many scammers hide behind bogus email accounts that provide no information about their whereabouts. Ask buyers to give you their phone number and set up a time to chat; the swindlers will quickly disappear. Exchanging text messages about buying a used car is normal these days, but push for a quick phone chat. As you talk with the potential buyer, pay attention to your intuition. If the buyer makes any unusual requests or if anything makes you uncomfortable, just wait for another buyer. 2. Follow the money. Nearly all online scams stem from some unusual financing request from the buyer. In a popular scam, the fraudulent buyer sends you a check with an additional amount to ship the car. You pay for the shipping, send the car\u00a0and then the check bounces. Before agreeing to meet, tell the prospective buyer you accept only cash. If the buyer insists on paying with a cashier\u2019s check, arrange to meet at the bank and watch as a teller handles the payment request. Don't be fooled: Here are the BBB's biggest consumer scams of 2016 3. Don\u2019t be overeager. Many scams work because of \u201cthe victim\u2019s own eagerness to close a deal they think is sweet,\u201d Scafidi says. So remember that real buyers will have questions about the car and will probably want to dicker. If you\u2019re selling your car to someone out of the area, expect that person to arrange with a mobile service to inspect the car. 4. Meet in a \u201csafe zone.\u201d Because so many people are arranging physical meetings after connecting over the internet, Scafidi says police departments are creating \u201c safe zones \u201d with video surveillance. These are good places to meet prospective buyers. Sadlier recommends that you, the seller, choose the meeting place. \u201cYou can take a lot of variables out of the equation by insisting on ground rules like that,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you feel vulnerable and you\u2019re not an automotive expert, bring a friend who is.\u201d Hertz to sell used cars via online site Shift If no safe zone is available, meet in a well-lit public place with plenty of people around. Also, if you have any suspicions, ask to see the buyer\u2019s driver\u2019s license before letting him or her drive your car. 5. Avoid buyers with too many stories. Many scams begin with pleas for help or unusual requests such as to ship a car out of the country. In some cases, scammers pose as members of the military to gain sympathy and elicit feelings of patriotism. Avoid all such requests. As Scafidi says, \u201cSlow down, ask questions and don\u2019t become emotionally involved in the sale.\u201d ",

    "text": "Team Trump: Flynn called Russia ambassador, no sanction talk 'plain and simple' Published               January 14, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Donald Trump transition team has acknowledged that its incoming national security adviser has been in contact with Russia's ambassador but denies reports they were plotting over recently imposed sanctions on Moscow. A transition team official acknowledged a call on Dec. 29, the day President Obama hit Russia for election-related hacking, but said the conversation was about \u201clogistics\u201d for a call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, who on Friday is sworn-in as president. \u201cThat was it. Plain and simple,\u201d the official told reporters on the team\u2019s daily conference call. The official said retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, texted Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to wish him a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. He said Kislyak, in a return text, requested and was granted a phone conversation in late December about the \u201clogistics of setting up call with the president of Russia and the president-elect.\u201d Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador were first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. \u201cI believe Ignatius will print an update now that he has been provided information to clarify,\u201d the transition official also said. It's not unusual for incoming administrations to have discussions with foreign governments before taking office. But repeated contacts just as Obama imposed sanctions raised questions about whether Trump's team discussed -- or even helped shape -- Russia's response. Reuters reports that Flynn and Kislyak talked several times on Dec. 29. Putin unexpectedly did not retaliate against the U.S. for the move, a decision Trump quickly praised. More broadly, Flynn's contact with the Russian ambassador suggests the incoming administration has already begun to lay the groundwork for its promised closer relationship with Moscow. That effort appears to be moving ahead, even as many in Washington, including Republicans, have expressed outrage over intelligence officials' assessment that Putin launched a hacking operation aimed at meddling in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump. In an interview published Friday evening by The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he might do away with Obama's sanctions if Russia works with the U.S. on battling terrorists and achieving other goals. \"If Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions?\" he asked. During a news conference Wednesday, Trump highlighted his warmer rapport with the Russian leader. \"If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia,\" he said. The sanctions targeted the GRU and FSB, leading Russian intelligence agencies that the U.S. said were involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other groups. The U.S. also kicked out 35 Russian diplomats who it said were actually intelligence operatives. Trump has been willing to insert himself into major foreign policy issues during the transition, at times contradicting the current administration and diplomatic protocol. He accepted a call from Taiwan's president, ignoring the longstanding \"One China\" policy that does not recognize the island's sovereignty. Asked about that Friday by the Journal, he responded, \"Everything is under negotiation.\" He also publicly urged the U.S. to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, then slammed the Obama administration for abstaining and allowing the measure to pass. Questions about Trump's friendly posture toward Russia have deepened since the election, as he has dismissed U.S. intelligence agencies' assertions about Russia's role in the hacking of Democratic groups. In briefing Trump on their findings, intelligence officials also presented the president-elect with unsubstantiated claims that Russia had amassed compromising personal and financial allegations about him, according to a separate U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter. The Senate Intelligence Committee announced late Friday that it would investigate possible contacts between Russia and people associated with U.S. political campaigns as part of a broader investigation into Moscow's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump acknowledged for the first time this week that he accepts that Russia was behind the hacking. But he questioned whether officials were leaking information about their meetings with him, warning that would be a \"tremendous blot\" on their record. Flynn's own ties with Russia have worried some Republicans who are more skeptical of the Kremlin than Trump appears to be. After leaving his position as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, Flynn made appearances on RT, a state-run Russian television network. In 2015, he was paid to attend an RT gala in Moscow, where he sat next to Putin. As national security adviser, Flynn will work in the West Wing close to the Oval Office and will have frequent access to Trump. Unlike Trump's nominees to lead the Pentagon, State Department and other national security agencies, Flynn's post does not require Senate confirmation. Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador were first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. The U.S. official who spoke to The Associated Press was not authorized to confirm the contacts publicly and insisted on anonymity. The Trump team's account of Flynn's contacts with the Russian envoy changed throughout the day Friday. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer initially said there was one phone call between Flynn and Kislyak on Dec. 28, as well as a Christmas greeting via text messages over the holidays. He said sanctions were not part of the discussions. Later Friday, a transition official said Flynn and Kislyak had spoken by phone on Dec. 29, following a text message from the ambassador the day before. During the call, the Russian ambassador invited U.S. officials to a conference on Syria later this month that is being held in Kazakhstan, according to the transition official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and insisted on anonymity. The official also confirmed a phone call between the men earlier in December. The U.S. official who spoke to the AP Friday described the contacts between Flynn and Kislyak as \"very frequent.\" It's unclear how U.S. officials became aware of the contacts between Flynn and Kislyak, who has served as Russia's envoy to the U.S. since 2008. U.S. monitoring of Russian officials' communication within the United States is known to be common. Flynn has spoken with other foreign officials since Trump won the November election, as have incoming White House senior advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said he saw nothing inappropriate in Trump's transition team contacting Russian or any other foreign officials.

Shortly after 8 a.m., two men were standing in the 1100 block of South Francisco Avenue when a black sedan pulled up, said police. A person exited the sedan and opened fire. He then got back into the sedan and fled north on Francisco, police said. A 27-year-old man was shot in the head and chest, and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The other victim, 39, suffered a wound to the back. He was taken to the same hospital and listed in good condition, police said. In the latest shooting, a 16-year-old boy was left in serious condition after being wounded in the West Englewood neighborhood, police said. About 11:45 a.m., the boy was shot in the 1900 block of West 70th Street. Police said the boy was walking west on 70th when someone in a vehicle started shooting and continued east. The boy suffered wounds to the upper torso and abdomen, and was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, police said. About 9:45 a.m., an 18-year-old man was shot in the same neighborhood as the earlier fatal attack. That shooting happened in the 1500 block of South Hamlin Avenue, police said. According to preliminary reports, the victim was walking up the rear porch of a building when he heard shots and was struck. He suffered a wound to the right elbow, and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was listed in good condition, police said. No one was in custody, and police were investigating. ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Anna DeBraber (left) and Lauren Kuzee learning to cast on for the first time at a Craft Raft Studios hat-making event on Jan. 6, 2017. (Photo: Stephanie Everitt-Kirkbride) Pink cat-ear hats are becoming the latest fashion trend among women across the country.\u00a0So much so that it's sparked a run on pink yarn. The sudden popularity in the shade is due to the\u00a0 Pussyhat Project , a national effort to flood the nation's capital\u00a0with women wearing\u00a0pink cat-ear hats\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0 Women's March on Washington \u00a0on Jan. 21. The project's goal is to make a visual statement on the first day of President-elect Donald Trump's administration to show\u00a0that women stand united when it comes to protecting their rights, said the project's co-founder, Jayna Zweiman. In response to the call to action, many crafters around the country\u00a0are knitting, crocheting\u00a0and sewing\u00a0hats as quickly as they can to ensure those in Washington and at sister marches in cities across the country have the pink hats\u00a0to wear. Women's March cat hats from Central Pa. benefit Planned Parenthood The goal is to deliver\u00a01 million hats to Washington, D.C., for distribution at the march. Women are making them for themselves, for their sisters or\u00a0daughters\u00a0and even for strangers, before dropping them off at pickup points around the country. Any shade of pink is OK, but\u00a0hot pink seems to be the most popular. Krista Suh (left) and Jayna Zweiman of Los Angeles are the founders of the Pussyhat Project. \u00a0(Photo: Breelyn Burns) \"I think it's resonating a lot because we're really saying that no matter who you are or where you are, you can be politically active,\" said\u00a0Zweiman, 38, of Los Angeles, who\u00a0teamed up with her friend, 29-year-old Krista Suh,\u00a0to launch the project in late November. As soon as the Women's March on Washington was announced, Suh made plans to be there. But Zweiman is recovering from a concussion and can't participate in person. Together, they came up with a large-scale, national hat project to engage people \u2014 whether they're marching or supporting someone else who is \u2014\u00a0and launched a website . \"It's about the knitting, but it's also about so much more,\" Zweiman said. They\u00a0used the term \"pussyhat\" for the project as\u00a0a play on words referencing the way Trump bragged about groping unsuspecting women in a 2005 recording leaked during the presidential race. \"'P----' is a very charged word; I'm now very used to saying it, but\u00a0it's interesting to hear people talk about the word, and how they feel about the word. These are conversations we all need to have. The discussions\u00a0are around what is this word, what does it mean?\u00a0A lot of it is constructive dialogue. \"In this era of really divisive politics and the news cycle is so pessimistic and gut-wrenching, people are rallying around being politically active and standing up for themselves ... This gives an opportunity\u00a0for people to support the marchers and physically represent themselves at the march, and\u00a0it's giving them warmth and support.\" Volunteer knitters have dropped off hats at\u00a0 Woven Art\u00a0 in East Lansing, Mich.,\u00a0to be\u00a0given away free to anyone who is going to a women's march, said Meg\u00a0Croft, who co-owns the yarn shop. The hope is that those who pick up a free hat might consider a donation to the\u00a0 American Civil Liberties Union \u00a0or\u00a0 Planned Parenthood . Women's march an 'entry point' for a new activist wave Many women are concerned that Trump will make good on campaign promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act, defund Planned Parenthood and appoint U.S. Supreme Court justices who are against abortion rights. \u201cWe have a big local demand, and being in a college town, we have a lot of people who are very concerned about the way things have been going recently,\u201d Croft said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a fairly liberal county, so people are upset and very concerned that rights are going to disappear.\" Croft's favorite yarn\u00a0for the hats is a hot pink, hand-dyed worsted-weight wool from\u00a0 Stonehedge Fiber Mill \u00a0in East Jordan, Mich. But that particular yarn is sold out right now, she said. This hot pink Shepherd's Wool Yarn is made from a hand-dyed worsted-weight wool from Stonehedge Fiber Mill in East Jordan, Mich. It is sold out because of high demand from knitters making pussyhats for the Women's March on Washington. \u00a0(Photo: Debbie McDermott) Debbie McDermott, who has owned Stonehedge Fiber Mill for 18 years and had her own wholesale line of\u00a0 Shepherd's Wool Yarn \u00a0for a decade, said the\u00a0hot pink shade\u00a0has never been so popular. \"We don\u2019t usually sell a whole lot of that, and then all of a sudden, everybody wanted hot pink,\" said McDermott, whose Shepherd's Wool Yarn is\u00a0sold in\u00a0 300 stores \u00a0nationally. \"There has been more demand. When yarn shops call and they need it right now, and you haven\u2019t sold that much of a color for the nine years you've been making it, no, you can't meet demand. \"We have a couple other pinks, but the hot pink is the one everybody\u2019s been wanting lately.\" ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Jan 14, 2017 5:08 PM EST WALTERBORO, S.C. -- Neighbors knew them for years as a church-going mother and her polite teenage daughter before police swarmed Gloria Williams\u2019 home in this small, quiet South Carolina city.\u00a0 Williams, 51, was arrested on kidnapping charges. Then came the real shocker: Police identified the victim as the 18-year-old woman Williams had raised as her daughter. Investigators said DNA analysis proved she had been stolen as an infant from a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t an abused child or a child who got in trouble,\u201d a stunned Joseph Jenkins said of the young woman who lived across the street. \u201cBut she grew up with a lie for 18 years.\u201d She has learned she was born as Kamiyah Mobley. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams described her Friday as being in good health but emotionally overwhelmed.\u00a0 Some months ago, the young woman \u201chad an inclination\u201d that she may have been kidnapped, the sheriff said. Authorities didn\u2019t say why she suspected this. \u00a0\u00a0 Tesha Stephens, a cousin of Williams\u2019, said the young woman had much to think about. \u201cShe\u2019s probably going to have to take this day-by-day,\u201d Stephens told reporters outside Williams\u2019 home. Mobley got to spend a few emotional moments with Williams, who is also charged with interference with custody, after her arrest. She cried \u201cMomma\u201d through the caged window of a security door after Williams waived extradition to Florida, according to WXJT-TV, which posted a video online. Meanwhile, the young woman\u2019s birth family cried \u201ctears of joy\u201d after a detective told them their baby had been found. Within hours Friday, they were able to reconnect over FaceTime. \u201cShe looks just like her daddy,\u201d her paternal grandmother, Velma Aiken of Jacksonville, told The Associated Press after they were able to see each other for the first time. \u201cShe act like she been talking to us all the time. She told us she\u2019d be here soon to see us.\u201d Mobley was only eight hours old when she was taken from her young mother by a woman posing as a nurse at University Medical Center. A massive search ensued, with helicopters circling the hospital and the city on high alert. Thousands of tips came in over the years, but she had disappeared.\u00a0 Composite image of Kamiyah Mobley, developed after her 1998 kidnapping. WJAX The case broke thanks to a tip received by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Robert Lowery, a center vice president. He would not say from whom the tip came. But the center soon reached out to the cold case detectives at the sheriff\u2019s office, and Mobley provided a swab of her cheek for DNA analysis that proved the match, the sheriff said. \u201cThis was something brand new to all of us,\u201d said Stephens, Williams\u2019 cousin. The center has tracked 308 infant abductions since 1983 by nonfamily members in the U.S. Of those cases, 12 were still missing at the end of last month. That\u2019s now one number smaller. The woman has been provided with counseling, the sheriff said. Meanwhile, Aiken is thrilled to know that they can speak with each other as much as they want. \u201cI always prayed, \u2018Don\u2019t let me die before I see my grandbaby,\u2019\u201d said Aiken. \u201cMy prayer was answered.\u201d The family never forgot the little girl ripped from her mother\u2019s arms that day in 1998. Her mother, Shanara Mobley, told the Florida Times-Union newspaper on the 10th anniversary of the kidnapping that on every one of Kamiyah\u2019s birthdays, she wrapped a piece of birthday cake in foil and stuck it in her freezer. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to wake up every day, knowing that your child is out there and you have no way to reach her or talk to her,\u201d Mobley told the paper in 2008. News moved quickly through the community of about 5,100 people early Friday after police cars swarmed Williams\u2019 home. Jenkins said he awoke to see officers searching the house and the shed around back. \u201cAt the fish market, the hair dresser, the gas station, they\u2019re all talking about it,\u201d said Ruben Boatwright, who said he\u2019s known Williams for about 15 years. Lakeshia Jenkins, Joseph\u2019s wife, said Williams and the girl would often come over for cookouts in the yard, or join their family at a nearby water park. Kamiyah seemed to be well cared for, and \u201cMs. Williams, she seemed like a normal person,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cShe went to work, came back here and went to church every Sunday,\u201d she said. Williams also worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 hospital in Charleston, volunteered in the area for Habitat for Humanity and led the youth program at a Methodist church, she said. \u201cShe\u2019s very intelligent, smart as a whip,\u201d Boatwright said. \u201cAll I can say are good things about her.\u201d Now, Williams faces life in prison if she\u2019s convicted in Florida, State Attorney Melissa Nelson said on Friday, according to CBS Jacksonville affiliate WJAX . Bond was denied for Williams, according to the station. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Taiwan since 1979. Trump claimed then that he only accepted a congratulatory call. A top Taiwanese official told NBC News the call was pre-arranged . At the time, China's foreign minister dismissed the call as \"only a little trick played by Taiwan.\" Related: Trump's Call With Taiwan's Leader Exposes China's Strained Relations Saturday, Lu said the One China policy was not open to debate. \"The One China principle serves as the political foundation for the development of China-U.S. ties and is non-negotiable,\" he said. \"We urge the U.S. side to be fully aware of the high sensitivity of the Taiwan question and stick to the commitment made by past U.S. administrations,\" Lu said. He said failing to do so could lead to disruptions in \"the sound and steady development of China-U.S. relationship and cooperation on key areas.\" Play ",

Civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton had organized Saturday's \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" march and rally ahead of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. But Trump, whose inauguration will take place in less than a week, was also on marchers' minds. Related: Trump Decries Civil Rights Icon John Lewis as 'No Action,' Sparking Backlash Holding umbrellas and bundled against temperatures in the mid-30s the crowd chanted \"No justice, no peace\" and \"We will not be moved\" but also \"We will not be Trumped\" and \"Love Trumps hate.\" They cheered when one speaker referenced the comments of Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who has said he will not attend Trump's inauguration and, an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" set to air Sunday, that he doesn't consider Trump a \"legitimate president.\" \"We come not to appeal to Donald Trump, because he's made it clear what his policies are and what his nominations are. We come to say to the Democrats in the Senate and in the House and to the moderate Republicans to 'Get some backbone. Get some guts.' We didn't send you down here to be weak-kneed,\" Sharpton told marchers at a rally after they walked from the Washington Monument to a park near the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. \u201cWe come to say to the Democrats in the Senate and in the House and to the moderate Republicans to \u2018Get some backbone. Get some guts.\u2019\u201d Sharpton called on marchers to oppose Trump's nominee for Attorney General, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, and asked the crowd if they were willing to visit their senators' offices to oppose the nomination. He told them: \"We need to make some house calls. We need to stay a little while.\" He later told The Associated Press those visits, involving a number of groups, would begin within the next 10 days. Protesters also gathered Saturday to support immigrant rights at rallies around the U.S., including in Washington, denouncing Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and his pledges to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and to crack down on Muslims entering the country.

    "text": "By William Harwood CBS News January 14, 2017, 3:41 PM SpaceX returns to flight with successful launch Email Last Updated Jan 14, 2017 9:27 PM EST A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted 10 next-generation Iridium telephone satellites into orbit Saturday, a successful return to fight that should help restore confidence in the low-cost booster after a devastating launch pad explosion last September. That dramatic conflagration likely was caused by super-cold oxygen in the booster\u2019s second stage that worked its way beneath the carbon fiber outer skin of a high pressure helium tank, triggering the tank\u2019s rupture and the near-instant destruction of the rocket and its $200 million satellite payload. SpaceX has successfully launched a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time since its last effort, which resulted in an explosion on the launch pad. CB... For Saturday\u2019s flight, SpaceX engineers changed a variety of pre-launch procedures, loading RP-1 kerosene fuel and liquid oxygen earlier in the countdown than before to slightly raise temperatures around the helium tanks. The technique was used for an engine test firing earlier this month and went off without a hitch Saturday. After brief concern about winds and a boat in the offshore danger zone, the slender 229-foot-tall rocket\u2019s nine first stage engines thundered to life at 9:54 a.m. PST (GMT-8), throttled up to full power and majestically pushed the booster away from its seaside launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base northwest of Los Angeles. Trailing a brilliant tongue of fiery exhaust, the Falcon 9 quickly arced away on a southerly trajectory as it climbed out of the dense lower atmosphere, its Merlin 1D engines generating a combined 1.5 million pounds of thrust. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasts off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., successfully launching 10 Iridium telephone satellites Jan. 14, 2017. This was SpaceX\u2019s first flight since a catastrophic launch pad explosion Sept. 1, 2016. SpaceX The first stage engines shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after launch. The stage then fell away and the single engine powering the Falcon 9\u2019s second stage took over, its nozzle glowing bright red against the limb of the Earth, generating 210,000 pounds of thrust to continue the climb to space. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket sits on a California launch pad, set to lift off at 9:54 a.m. Pacific Time Saturday. The company's return to space comes... The first stage, meanwhile, flipped around and restarted three of its engines to reduce forward velocity and begin a descent to a SpaceX droneship stationed several hundred miles south of Vandenberg. Recovering stages for eventual refurbishment and reuse is a major element in company founder Elon Musk\u2019s ongoing drive to reduce launch costs. After a second engine firing to slow the booster still more for atmospheric entry, the stage plummeted tail first toward the Pacific Ocean, restarted a single engine, deployed four landing legs and settled to a picture-perfect touchdown on the droneship Just Read the Instructions. The first stage of the Falcon 9 completed a successful descent to a SpaceX droneship stationed south of the launch site. It was SpaceX\u2019s seventh successful landing in 12 attempts. SpaceX webcast It was the company\u2019s seventh successful landing in 12 attempts, its fifth on a droneship and the first for a Falcon 9 launched from Vandenberg. But as with all Falcon 9 flights, the landing was a strictly secondary objective. The primary goal was to boost the 10 Iridium NEXT satellite telephone relay stations into orbit and the Falcon 9 did just that. The second stage completed the first of two burns just over nine minutes after liftoff. A short three-second burn was executed 43 minutes later to complete the climb to an initial 488-mile-high orbit tilted 86.4 degrees to the equator. Seven minutes after that, the 10 Iridium NEXT satellites were released in sequence from a dispenser mounted atop the second stage, the first batch in a planned 72-satellite network that will replace the company\u2019s current fleet of aging low-Earth-orbit mobile voice and data relay stations. The complex satellite-by-satellite swap-out will allow Iridium to retire first-generation relay stations that have operated long past their design life, replacing them with upgraded, more powerful spacecraft and expanding the company\u2019s capabilities in an increasingly competitive commercial space operations environment. \u201cFrankly, it means our future, because we have to replace this network anyway,\u201d Iridium CEO Matthew Desch said in an interview with CBS News last year. \u201cI often think of it as one of the biggest tech refreshes in the world right now, with a new $3 billion constellation.\u201d Altogether, Iridium is paying SpaceX upwards of $500 million for seven Falcon 9 launches to boost 70 Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit, 10 at a time, over the next year or so. Two more will be launched aboard a different rocket. \u201cThe new satellites are a lot more powerful, a lot more processing power, they\u2019ve got a lot more memory, a lot more capacity, they actually expand our ability to support customers,\u201d Desch said. And, he added, \u201cthey\u2019re easier to operate.\u201d Engineers will spend three months testing each new satellite and carrying out a satellite-by-satellite swap-out, moving a new spacecraft into position near the vehicle it\u2019s replacing and switching service from one to the other. The Iridium network requires 66 satellites to provide global coverage, but the company plans to launch 15 in-orbit spares to provide immediate backup in case of an in-orbit malfunction and to serve as an insurance policy of sorts in the event of a launch failure. An Iridium NEXT satellite. Iridium As important as the Falcon 9 launching was to Iridium, it was even more important for SpaceX after an in-flight failure in June 2015 and the dramatic on-pad explosion Sept. 1 at Cape Canaveral. The Falcon 9\u2019s record of two failures in 29 rockets stands in contrast to the record of its major U.S. competitor, United Launch Alliance, which has launched 102 more expensive Atlas 5s and Delta 4s without a single failure. The European consortium Arianespace has successfully launched more than 75 Ariane 5s in a row. But SpaceX enjoys widespread support in the satellite industry, in large part because of the Falcon 9\u2019s innovative design and relatively low cost. With a list price of $60 million per booster, a Falcon 9 is roughly half the cost of rockets offered by its major competitors. But lower costs cannot offset significantly higher risk, and industry analysts say SpaceX needs a string of successful flights to maintain its long-range goal of capturing a major share of the commercial launch market. With a successful return to flight Saturday, SpaceX will now focus on working off a backlog of delayed payloads, launching a commercial communications satellite from Cape Canaveral later this month and a space station resupply mission in February. The first flight of a \u201cused\u201d Falcon 9 first stage is expected in the next few months. Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX president and CEO, said the company currently has about 70 flights on its manifest, a backlog valued at some $10 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that SpaceX lost $260 million in the wake of the 2015 in-flight failure, launching just six missions that year instead of 12 that were originally planned. It\u2019s not known what impact the September failure might have on the company\u2019s bottom line or how delays will ripple through its manifest. SpaceX launched eight flights in 2016 and was forced to delay at least seven more. But Shotwell is optimistic, saying earlier this week that no customers have abandoned SpaceX. Bret Johnsen, SpaceX chief financial officer, said in a statement the company continues to enjoy \u201cstrong customer relationships.\u201d \u201cFurthermore,\u201d he said, \u201cwith over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Of the $1 billion total, $25 million will be paid as a fine to the U.S. government and $125 million will be used for restitution to people who are physically injured by the air bags. The remaining money will go to automakers that were defrauded by Takata, to cover the cost of replacing recalled parts. Three high-level executives at the company were also indicted on wire fraud and conspiracy charges, U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said at a news conference Friday in Detroit to announce the settlement. The three Japanese executives, Shinichi Tanaka, Hideo Nakajima and Tsuneo Chikaraishi, allegedly concealed deadly defects in the inflator inside the company's air bags.

USA TODAY NETWORK President-elect Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) President-elect Donald Trump, in a fresh peek at his\u00a0foreign policy views, says he is\u00a0open to lifting sanctions against Russia and is not committed\u00a0to a longstanding agreement with China over Taiwan. Beijing swiftly responded to the latter remark,\u00a0calling\u00a0any revision of the longstanding \"One China\" policy \"non-negotiable.\" Trump's comments came\u00a0in an hour-long interview with\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal \u00a0on Friday in which he said he will keep the sanctions on Russia in place \"for a period of time\" but is open to lifting them if Moscow cooperates on issues of mutual interest. While several\u00a0sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014 over\u00a0its annexation of Crimea, the latest measures, as well as\u00a0 the expulsion of\u00a035 Russian diplomats, \u00a0were imposed by the Obama administration last month\u00a0in response\u00a0to evidence Russia hacked Democratic Party officials during the presidential election. Senate intel panel to examine possible campaign links with Russia Trump's latest views on Russia comes only\u00a0days after\u00a0 CNN's report regarding classified documents \u00a0presented to Obama and Trump during an intelligence briefing last week that contained\u00a0unsubstantiated and\u00a0potentially compromising information about the president-elect. \"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?\" Trump said in the Journal interview. He added, however, he would keep the latest sanctions in place \"at least for a period of time.\" Trump acknowledged\u00a0for the first time this week that he accepts Russia was behind the hacking. But he questioned whether officials were leaking information about their meetings with him, warning that would be a \u201ctremendous blot\u201d on their record. Trump says 'I have nothing to do with Russia.' That's not exactly true The president-elect also told the\u00a0Journal\u00a0he is\u00a0willing to meet with\u00a0Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin after he takes office next week. \"I understand that they would like to meet, and that's absolutely fine with me,\" Trump added. Regarding China, Trump was specifically asked whether he supports the U.S. \"One China\" policy on Taiwan, which declares the province as part of China. Trump's response: \"Everything is under negotiation, including One China.\" He described it as leverage in any talks\u00a0with Beijing over\u00a0trade and currency issues. China: Trump\u2019s Taiwan comments spark \u2018serious concern\u2019 The remarks come only weeks after Trump's unprecedented phone conversation with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen shortly after the November election. There has been no communication between the leaders of the United States and Taiwan since 1979. The latest comments brought a swift and pointed response from China.\u00a0 In a statement Saturday , Lu Kang, spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, called the One China policy \"non-negotiable\" and the \"political foundation\" of China-U.S. relations. Four ways Trump could tangle with China \"To avoid disruption to the sound and steady development of the China-U.S. relations and bilateral cooperation in key areas, we urge relevant parties in the U.S. to fully recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan question, approach Taiwan-related issues with prudence and honor the commitment made by all previous U.S. administrations of both parties on adhering to the one-China policy,\" Kang said. Why China matters in Trump's economic policy Trump's comments appear to represent\u00a0a departure from remarks by his advisers in early December that the phone call to Taiwan's leader did\u00a0not signify any formal shift in long-standing U.S. relations with Taiwan or China. In mid-December, An Fengshan, a spokesman for China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, warned of more serious consequences if U.S. shifts positions on the Taiwan issue. \"If this basis is interfered with or damaged, then the healthy, stable development of China-U.S. relations is out of the question, and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait will be seriously impacted,\" he added, according to the BBC ..

(Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune) People from a dozen organizations and communities gathered to rally for immigrant and refugee rights Jan. 14, 2017, at Chicago Teachers Union headquarters on Chicago's Near West Side. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune) Student Cindy Agustin fears her parents will be deported and she'll never see them again. Nareman Taha worries the government will create a Muslim registry to track people of her faith. Teacher Jaime Serrano is concerned about his second-grade students, some of whom are anxious they will be separated from their families. \"It's heartbreaking,\" he said. \"They are really scared.\" Anxiety about the future \u2014 and resolve to change it \u2014 brought more than 1,000 people together Saturday for a Chicago rally against President-elect Donald Trump 's hard-line immigration proposals. Protesters chanted \"no justice, no peace,\" waved signs reading \"We Are Here to Stay,\" and cheered community, faith and labor leaders who called for unity and action. The rally, held at the Chicago Teachers Union headquarters on the Near West Side, coincided with similar protests in dozens of other U.S. cities Saturday, six days before Trump is to be inaugurated. Hundreds of people gathered at Chicago Teachers Union\u00a0headquarters on the Near West Side\u00a0for a pro-immigrant rally Jan. 14, 2017. During his campaign for the White House, Trump adopted strict positions on immigration, including building \"a big, fat beautiful wall\" at the U.S.-Mexican border. But he also sent mixed messages, and now many people wonder exactly what he will do as president. \"I mean, that's the issue with Trump, right? He's completely unpredictable,\" Chicago rally organizer Lawrence Benito said in an interview prior before the event. \"He says one thing and then he walks it back. I don't know what to expect.\" Immigration activists, Benito said, will watch Trump's first 100 days in office closely. \"We're going to be prepared \u2014 for what we can anticipate \u2014 for the fight to come,\" said Benito, head of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, the rally's lead organization. Agustin, a 27-year-old graduate student at the University of Chicago, said in an interview she is an immigrant from Mexico living in the U.S. without legal permission and worries that she won't be able to renew her work permit and find a job upon graduation.

    "text": "<p>An undated photo shows Tamir Rice.</p> Close Rice family/WOIO-TV CLEVELAND -- Internal disciplinary charges have been brought against two white police officers involved in the killing of Tamir Rice , a 12-year-old black boy playing with a pellet gun outside a recreation center, city officials said. But a police union said the officer who fatally shot the boy \u201cdid nothing wrong that day.\u201d Disciplinary charges recommended against Officers Timothy Loehmann, who shot Tamir, and Frank Garmback, who was driving their cruiser, were sent to the city\u2019s safety director, police Chief Calvin Williams said. The director will determine what action might be taken regarding the disciplinary charges, which city officials didn\u2019t specify during a Friday evening news conference. Disciplinary hearings will be held. Tamir Rice's family settles with Cleveland over fatal police shooting The two officers went to the recreation center in November 2014 after a man drinking beer and waiting for a bus there called 911 to report a \u201cguy\u201d was pointing a gun at people. The caller told the 911 dispatcher the guy was probably a juvenile and the gun might be \u201cfake,\u201d information never relayed to the officers. Loehmann shot Tamir within seconds of the police cruiser skidding to a stop near the boy. The officers told investigators Loehmann had shouted three times at Tamir to raise his hands. The killing became part of a national outcry about minorities, especially black boys and men, dying at the hands of police. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Friday that Loehmann and Garmback received letters along with a third officer, William Cunningham. The newspaper said the letters outlined these reasons for the discipline: Loehmann allegedly lied on his Cleveland police application, not disclosing that when he worked at the Independence Police Department for six months a letter was placed in his personnel file saying he was emotionally immature and had \u201can inability to emotionally function.\u201d The disciplinary letter also said Loehmann had an emotional breakdown on the gun range in Independence and that he failed a 2009 written exam when he applied for an officer\u2019s job in Maple Heights. It said Loehmann never mentioned the Maple Heights test. Garmback drove his cruiser too close to Tamir when Garmback responded to what he thought was an armed suspect and he failed to report the time he arrived at the scene. Cunningham, who was working off-duty at the recreation center, was accused of lying to investigators and working off-duty at the center without permission. The Cuyahoga County prosecutor announced in December 2015 that Loehmann and Garmback wouldn\u2019t be indicted after telling a grand jury there wasn\u2019t evidence to support criminal charges. A Rice family attorney had called for the firings of the two officers. The attorney, Subodh Chandra, sent a letter to the police chief on Jan. 3 questioning why they hadn\u2019t been fired or disciplined. Tamir\u2019s mother, Samaria Rice, settled a federal civil rights lawsuit with the city for $6 million. She and Chandra said the city did not contact them about the administrative charges, CBS Cleveland affiliate WOIO-TV reports . \u201cThese charges are disappointing, insufficient and regrettably the family also has little confidence that the administration will properly pursue these charges and that the charges will stick,\u201d Chandra said. \u00a0 Cleveland 19 News Cleveland, OH The Cleveland Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association said Friday it was \u201cencouraged\u201d that Loehmann wasn\u2019t charged with any wrongdoing regarding his response to the events of Nov. 22, 2014, which it called \u201ctragic.\u201d \u201cNevertheless, all agree that Officer Loehmann was not wrong in reacting the way he did,\u201d union president Stephen S. Loomis said in a statement. \u201cIt appears that the actual charges are created to discipline him, and perhaps discharge him, despite the fact that he did nothing wrong that day.\u201d The union said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that Garmback was charged with \u201cmaking a tactical error on his approach, when it is apparent that the car slid in the ice and mud well beyond what he intended.\u201d The union said it was reviewing the disciplinary charges and would prepare appropriate defenses for the officers. It said there would be no comment from the officers. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

By Robert Costa and Philip Rucker January 14 at 4:32 PM Follow @costareports Follow @PhilipRucker Running for president, Donald Trump promised an immediate revolution \u2014 to quickly rebuild America\u2019s cities, overhaul the tax code and deport millions of illegal immigrants. Just this week, Trump vowed to get started right away on building a wall along the border with Mexico (\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait\u201d) and repealing and replacing President Obama\u2019s health-care law (\u201cprobably the same day, could be the same hour\u201d). But ahead of his swearing-in on Friday, the extraordinarily high expectations that Trump has set have been running into the logjam known as American democracy. Every new president confronts Washington\u2019s sluggish culture, but Trump\u2019s more grandiose and hard-line ideas could face unprecedented challenges \u2014 logistical and even constitutional. Trump imagines a presidency of vision and velocity, but his big-ticket goals cannot be achieved by presidential edict, no matter how loud Trump\u2019s demands might be or how assured he is of the popularity of his proposals. They will require consensus on Capitol Hill that emerges from a deliberative process that requires time and the navigation of a labyrinth of constituencies and special interests. Trump\u2019s team has devised a full legislative calendar with congressional leaders that begins with health care, but already, Trump\u2019s ambitions have been slowed somewhat. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate are moving swiftly to dismantle parts of the Affordable Care Act but are still discussing how exactly to replace it. A House vote Friday on a budget measure, which included steps to begin repealing the health law, was preceded by hours of skittishness among conservative and moderate members alike about whether Republicans were moving too soon. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Similarly, a spending package to construct roads, bridges and airports \u2014 a priority for leaders of both political parties \u2014 could become bogged down by squabbles over disbursement. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government was built for speed,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who, as Senate majority whip, is the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican. \u201cThings always happen more slowly than you want when you\u2019re in the majority and trying to get something done.\u201d Several Trump advisers acknowledge that congressional procedures dictate that \u201cthe wheels of change move slowly,\u201d as one put it. But Kellyanne Conway, the incoming White House counselor, said she was confident that Trump\u2019s agenda will gain momentum. \u201cThe Trump effect on Washington, D.C., is not going to be a fresh coat of paint on a rusty structure,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more of a gut renovation.\u201d Conway predicted that Trump will bring new energy to a city that has operated at a \u201cglacial pace,\u201d as well as \u201cinfuse levels of accountability, metrics and deliverables in a system that seems to lack if not abhor all three of those things.\u201d Yet, for a man who has spent his career as his own boss \u2014 calling shots and inking transactions, running his world from the 26th floor of Trump Tower \u2014 the art of the deal may soon yield to the art of patience. \u201cHe\u2019s never had a boss in his whole life. It will be a sobering reality to have 535 bosses here \u2014 and more to the point, more than 200\u00a0million bosses scattered across the country,\u201d said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.). \u201cPatience becomes a virtue as one moves from the business world into the body politic.\u201d (The Washington Post) [ In Trump\u2019s Washington, rival power centers and whispers in the president\u2019s ear ] There have been some signs that Trump is starting to internalize his new surroundings. At his news conference Wednesday, Trump said he would be \u201cthe greatest jobs producer that God ever created\u201d \u2014 but then conceded that an economic revival depends not only on his hard work, but also on \u201ca little bit of luck.\u201d The tempo is sure to frustrate Trump. It also risks making him appear ineffective to the masses of voters who bought into his campaign persona as a successful dealmaker and strongman who could blow up Washington and \u2014 seemingly overnight \u2014 better the lives of everyday Americans. Trump\u2019s inner circle is grappling with how to manage expectations and are looking for ways to demonstrate quick action and claim early victories. Vice President-elect Mike Pence \u2014 who spent 12 years in the House before being elected Indiana\u2019s governor and is intimately familiar with the volatility of Congress \u2014 has been central in those talks, according to senior transition officials. There are areas where Trump\u2019s incoming administration sees opportunity to act unilaterally, such as in negotiating trade deals or lifting Obama-era regulations. Trump plans a series of executive actions on a wide range of topics in his first days in office, and he told reporters he wants to have daily bill-signing ceremonies in his first two weeks. Trump also plans in those weeks to announce his pick for the Supreme Court seat made vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nomination is expected to consume partisans on both sides and could take several months to reach confirmation. Another roadblock: public resistance and protests, in particular on immigration, as well as potential resistance among more mainstream Republicans \u2014 including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) \u2014 to Trump\u2019s most controversial proposals, such as a federal deportation force. [ \u2018I will give you everything.\u2019 Here are 282 of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises. ] \u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d Ryan said Thursday when asked about such a force during a CNN town hall forum. Rep. Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.) said, \u201cTrump\u2019s going to come up to the reality of the Republican Senate, which is full of people who have supported immigration reform.\u201d Trump associates privately say that any blame for delay or inaction on the meatier agenda items could be directed at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House: the Capitol. Even as they commended him for tapping into the deep dissatisfaction that Americans feel about the political system \u2014 and Congress specifically \u2014 some Republican lawmakers said they were concerned that Trump has created expectations too great to meet. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Trump could be \u201cgiving false hope to people and, frankly, undercutting a system that works.\u201d \u201cHe needs to inform the American people that, \u2018Yes, I want to drain the swamp, but there is a process in place that was set long before I got here that I think serves the country well,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Graham said. One victim of Trump\u2019s rapid-fire approach to legislating, Democrats say, could be bipartisanship. \u201cThe approach they are taking seems to be explicitly partisan and to try to run as fast as they can,\u201d said Phil Schiliro, who served as White House legislative affairs director during President Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cBut I think there will probably be brakes on the system. It\u2019s just the nature of legislation, the way House and Senate legislators work.\u201d Republican congressional leaders are delicately balancing Trump\u2019s vocal push, and their own desire for rapid change, with the dynamics confronting them in their chambers. In Trump, they see opportunity to pass a raft of legislation and a willing partner as long as the relationship is continually cultivated. Conway said that in meetings with Pence last week, Republican lawmakers found Trump\u2019s leadership style \u201cfascinating\u201d and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can jump on board and keep up.\u201d [ Trump acknowledges Russian hacking even as he attacks U.S. intelligence community ] Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) shrug off Trump\u2019s missives on Twitter and play up their phone calls and meetings with him. They echo his rhetoric about the pace, even as they quietly mention caveats that could delay passage \u2014 anything to keep Trump at ease with an institution he once disdained and is now getting to know. For instance, Ryan has taken care to stay \u201cin complete sync,\u201d as he said Thursday, with the incoming administration. Ryan invited Trump and Pence to speak at a party retreat in Philadelphia this month and hosted top Trump advisers in recent days for an hours-long dinner of pasta and salad in his office to begin discussions on tax reform. \u201cWe agree; we want to make sure we move these things concurrently,\u201d Ryan said when asked about the timing of a replacement for the health-care law. But, he noted, the House will \u201cdo this the way Congress is supposed to work.\u201d For initial policy changes, Republicans are going to use a process called budget reconciliation \u2014 where only a simple majority is needed. But not all parts of the health law can be removed in that fashion, and many other issues will most likely require 60 votes to overcome Democratic filibusters. Republicans control the Senate by 52 seats to 48. In pushing to move quickly, Republicans also run the risk of being accused of hypocrisy. Republicans fiercely criticized Obama as moving too rapidly to pass the 2010 health-care law, which was the subject of 14 months of debate as Democrats tried, and failed, to attract GOP support. The Senate held 100 days of hearings and other reviews on the matter, and the House held 79, according to Schiliro. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, extraordinarily complicated issue,\u201d Schiliro said. \u201cA new law can\u2019t be put in by fiat.\u201d Nevertheless, rank-and-file Republicans like what they are hearing from Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to exhort a molasses-like institution to act more quickly,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). \u201cWhen you\u2019re the coach of the team, you always emphasize speed. But how fast the players go is how fast the players go. The coach can only do so much.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

John Lewis, D-Georgia, in two tweets Saturday morning, following the congressman\u2019s plans to boycott next week\u2019s inauguration. The president-elect disparaged Lewis as \u201cAll talk, talk talk - no action or results\u201d and attacking him for representing a Georgia district Mr. Trump claimed was \u201ccrime infested\u201d and \u201cfalling apart.\u201d Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to...... \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017 The attacks, launched just two days before the nation celebrates the civil rights legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., follow Lewis\u2019 decision to sit out the presidential inauguration Friday. On missing the ceremony -- the first in three decades that Lewis will not be present for -- the Georgia Democrat told NBC in an interview , \u201cyou cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong.\u201d Lewis also contested Mr. Trump\u2019s legitimacy as president in his NBC interview scheduled to air Sunday. President-elect Donald Trump has responded after civil rights icon John Lewis, a Democratic congressman, said Mr. Trump is an illegitimate presid... \u201cI don\u2019t see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\u201d After Mr. Trump\u2019s pointed missives, several Twitter users came to Lewis\u2019 immediate defense, tweeting their own critical messages to the president-elect and reminding him of the Georgia congressman\u2019s record on civil rights.

The rocket's first stage booster landed on a ship in the Pacific Ocean about eight minutes later. (Photo: SpaceX) SpaceX has launched a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time since a fireball engulfed a similar rocket on a Florida launch pad more than four months ago. The two-stage rocket lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, on Saturday morning to place 10 satellites into orbit for Iridium Communications Inc. About eight minutes later, the rocket\u2019s first-stage booster flew down from the edge of space to a modified barge in the Pacific Ocean, touching down softly on four landing legs on an \u201cX\u201d painted on the center of the deck. The booster is the seventh that SpaceX has recovered since late 2015, and the company says it hopes to launch a mission on a used stage soon. Meanwhile, the rocket\u2019s upper-stage continued on with 10 Iridium Communications satellites, the first of 70 SpaceX is contracted to launch by early next year. The 10 Iridium NEXT spacecraft will begin replacing the company\u2019s aging constellation, whose first satellites were launched nearly two decades ago and have far outlived their expected lives. The upgraded network will offer improved broadband data services around the globe, and new services including real-time tracking of aircraft and ships from space.

If the mission is completed successfully, SpaceX hopes to return to Florida for another commercial satellite launch as soon as Jan. 26. The launch would be SpaceX's first from historic pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center, the launching point for Apollo moon shots and dozens of space shuttle missions.

(Photo: Krzysztof Zatycki, AP) Polish leaders\u00a0celebrated the arrival of U.S. troops Saturday as part of a NATO deployment that has drawn criticism from Russia. \u201cWe have waited for you for a very long time,\u201d Polish Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said during a ceremony in the western Polish town of Zagan, the Associated Press\u00a0reported. Some 3,000 American troops are being deployed in Poland and six other countries under NATO's \u201cOperation Atlantic Resolve,\u201d which was launched after Russia's takeover of Crimea in 2014. The Polish arrival ceremony comes more than two decades after the last Soviet troops left the country and just ahead of the swearing in of President-elect Donald Trump, who critics fear will embolden Russia. \u201cWe waited for decades, sometimes feeling we had been left alone, sometimes almost losing hope, sometimes feeling that we were the only one who protected civilization from aggression that came from the east,\u201d Macierewicz said. Russian President Vladimir Putin's\u00a0spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested Thursday that\u00a0the foreign military buildup near its borders was inappropriate and that any other country would feel the same way. The operation marks the first time Western forces are being deployed on a continuous basis to NATO\u2019s eastern border. \"We interpret this as a threat to us and as actions that endanger our interests and our security,\" Peskov said, Russia's TASS news agency reported. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine put on edge many countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states\u00a0that were once under Soviet control. The U.S. deployment includes an armored brigade of 3,500 American troops from Fort Carson, Colo., more than 80 main battle tanks and hundreds of armored vehicles. The Polish government organized several events across the country to welcome the Americans, including in downtown Warsaw. \u201cThis is an important day for Poland, for Europe, for our common defense,\u201d Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said, the AP reported.

It calls for $437.5 million to go to the Justice Department and $426.3 million to be divided among the states and the District of Columbia.\u00a0 The Department of Justice announced a $1.4 billion settlement with the ratings agency over allegations it knowingly inflated ratings of risky mor... Moody\u2019s -- along with the other two major rating agencies, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch -- were widely criticized for giving low-risk ratings to the risky mortgage securities being sold ahead of the crisis, while they reaped lucrative fees. In the settlement, the world\u2019s second-largest credit ratings agency acknowledged that it didn\u2019t follow its own standards in rating the risk of securities backed by home mortgages and the collateralized debt obligations that relied on their health. The system spread the risk of mortgage defaults to banks around the globe and led to a string of financial collapses in 2008 when people began defaulting on risky subprime loans. That caused the housing market to implode in many areas and sparked the worst U.S. recession since the Depression. Moody\u2019s acknowledged that it used a more lenient standard for certain financial products and didn\u2019t make public the differences from its published standards. \u201cMoody\u2019s failed to adhere to its own credit rating standards and fell short on its pledge of transparency in the run-up to the Great Recession,\u201d Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Bill Baer said in a statement. Under the settlement, Moody\u2019s agreed to a number of reforms designed to make sure its credit ratings are objective, including separating commercial and credit rating functions; ensure changes to its rating methods are independently reviewed, and ensuring that some employees aren\u2019t compensated based on Moody\u2019s own financial performance. \u201cThe agreement acknowledges the considerable measures Moody\u2019s has put in place to strengthen and promote the integrity, independence and quality of its credit ratings,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a statement. \u201cAs part of the resolution, Moody\u2019s has agreed to maintain, for the next five years, a number of existing compliance measures and to implement and maintain certain additional measures over the same period.\u201d The agreement comes two years after the world\u2019s largest ratings agency, Standard & Poor\u2019s, agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to settle similar allegations by the Justice Department, 19 states and the District of Columbia. With the District of Columbia, the states involved in the settlement announced Friday are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Washington. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

His jab appeared to irk Trump, who tweeted that he \"should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\" The last part didn't sit well with Democratic lawmakers, some who noted that Trump was ripping the black congressman \u2014 the son of Southern sharecroppers whose fight against segregation and as an original Freedom Rider is well-documented \u2014 on the weekend ahead of the King holiday. Lewis was beaten during a civil rights march in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 and had been arrested and jailed repeatedly in opposition to desegregation. Since joining Congress in 1987, he's been a leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus.

He was 89. Blatty died Thursday at a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where he lived, his widow, Julie Alicia Blatty, told The Associated Press. The cause of death was multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer, she said. Inspired by an incident that unfolded in St. Louis and Washington, D.C., that Blatty had read about while in college, \"The Exorcist\" was published in 1971, followed two years later by the film of the same name. Blatty's story of a 12-year-old-girl inhabited by a satanic force spent more than a year on The New York Times fiction best-seller list and eventually sold more than 10 million copies. It reached a far wider audience through the movie version, directed by William Friedkin, produced and written by Blatty and starring Linda Blair as the young, bedeviled Regan. \"RIP William Peter Blatty, who wrote the great horror novel of our time,\" Stephen King tweeted Friday. \"So long, Old Bill.\" Even those who thought they had seen everything had never seen anything like the R-rated \"The Exorcist\" and its assault of vomit, blood, rotting teeth, ghastly eyes and whirlwind head-spinning \u2014 courtesy of makeup and special effects maestro Dick Smith. Fans didn't care that Vincent Canby of The New York Times found it a \"chunk of elegant occultist claptrap,\" or that the set burned down during production. They stood for hours in freezing weather for the winter release and kept coming even as the movie, with its omnipresent soundtrack theme, Mike Oldfield's chilly, tingly \"Tubular Bells,\" cast its own disturbing spell. Article continues after sponsorship From around the world came reports of fainting, puking, epileptic fits, audience members charging the screen and waving rosary beads, and, in England, a boy committing murder and blaming \"The Exorcist.\" The Rev. Billy Graham would allege that the film's very celluloid was evil. \"I was standing in the back of a theater in New York at the first public press screening of the film, too nervous to sit down,\" Blatty told IGN.com in 2000. \"And along came a woman who got up in about the fifth or sixth row. A young woman, who started walking up the aisle, slowly at first. She had her hand to her head. And then I could see her lips moving. She got close enough, and I could hear her murmuring, 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.'\" Named the scariest movie of all time by Entertainment Weekly, \"The Exorcist\" topped $400 million worldwide at the box office, among the highest at the time for an R-rated picture. Oscar voters also offered rare respect for a horror film: \"The Exorcist\" was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and received two, for best sound and Blatty's screenplay. Imitations, parodies and sequels were inevitable, whether the Leslie Nielsen spoof \"Repossessed\"; the four subsequent \"Exorcist\" movies (only one of which, \"The Exorcist III,\" involved Blatty) or a stage version performed in 2012 at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. \"When I was writing the novel I thought of it as a super-natural detective story, and to this day I cannot recall having a conscious intention to terrifying anybody, which you may take, I suppose, as an admission of failure on an almost stupefying scale,\" Blatty told The Huffington Post in 2011. Blatty returned to the \"Exorcist\" setting in \"Legion,\" which he adapted into \"The Exorcist III.\" He also revised a novel from the 1960s, \"Twinkle, Twinkle, 'Killer Kane\"'; renamed it \"The Ninth Configuration\" and wrote and directed a 1980 film version that brought Blatty a Golden Globe for best screenplay. In 2011, he worked in a new scene for a reissue of the 1971 novel, originally acquired by Bantam Books for a reported $250,000. More recently, Fox announced it would revive the story as a TV series, starring Geena Davis. Blatty was married four times and had eight children. \"He was an absolutely wonderful, kind, generous, faith-filled man, and I was very blessed to be his wife,\" Julie Blatty said. The son of Lebanese immigrants, Blatty was born in New York City and remembered a childhood of unpaid bills and nonstop evasion of rent collectors. He was a scholarship student at the Jesuit high school Brooklyn Preparatory (future Penn State football coach Joe Paterno was a year behind) and graduated as class valedictorian. He received another scholarship to attend Georgetown University and earned a master's in English literature from George Washington University. As recounted in his memoir \"I'll Tell Them I Remember You,\" he took many detours on his journey to the top. He sold vacuum cleaners, drove a beer truck, served in the Air Force, was stationed in Beirut by the United States Information Agency, tried and failed to get stories published in Collier's, and auditioned for a role in Cecil B. DeMille's Biblical epic \"The Ten Commandments.\" He alleged that he was turned down because his eyes were blue. For much of the 1960s, he turned out screenplays, including for the Blake Edwards films \"A Shot in the Dark\" and \"What Did You Do In the War, Daddy?\" By the end of the decade, he was in a state of \"financial desperation\" and finally got around to a novel he had been thinking about for years. He had remembered a Washington Post report from the late 1940s: A 14-year-old boy from Maryland was reportedly possessed, his condition defined by a visiting Duke University official as \"the most impressive example of poltergeist phenomena I have ever come across.\" \"Like so many Catholics, I've had so many little battles of wavering faith over the course of my life,\" Blatty, who would allege numerous mysterious events while working on the book, told IGN.com. \"And when I heard about this case and read the details, that seemed so compelling. I thought, 'My God, if someone were to investigate this and authenticate it, what a tremendous boost to faith it would be.' I thought, 'Someday I would like to see that happen. You know, I would like to do it.'\" ",

Hall, 72, is accused of battering and trying to sexually assault a paramedic.\u00a0 Roy U. Hall, 72, is accused of battering and trying to sexually assault a paramedic.\u00a0 (Chicago Police Department) William Lee Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A 72-year-old man from the Chatham neighborhood was ordered held on $250,000 bail Saturday for allegedly attacking and attempted to sexually assault a female paramedic as she and her partner took the man to an area hospital following a traffic crash earlier this week.\u00a0 Dressed in a long grey wool overcoat, a frail-looking Roy U. Hill leaned forward against the judge's bench to balance himself as he stood before a Cook County Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr. on charges of aggravated battery to a peace officer and attempted aggravated criminal sexual assault. The victim, a 36-year-old female Chicago Fire Department paramedic and her partner were transporting Hall to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after his vehicle struck a pole in the 3300 block of South King Drive about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, officials said just after the incident. When the ambulance was about two blocks from the hospital, prosecutors said Hall began to struggle with his neck brace and tried to take it off. When the victim, who was in the rear of the ambulance, tried aiding Hall, he allegedly grabbed the paramedic's hand, forcing her to pull away. Hall then began swinging his arms and struck the woman in the chest multiple times, authorities said. Hall then grabbed the victim's hair and her radio strap, pulling her down toward his groin and began saying lewd comments to her, according to Assistant State's Attorney Bryan Grissman. During the struggle, Hall punched the victim in the ribs about 15 times, Grissman said. Hall continued pulling the victim\u2019s hair, attempting to pull her toward his genitals and on top of him while continuously making crude comments. The victim\u2019s partner, who was driving the ambulance, heard the struggle after pulling into the hospital and pried the older man's hands off the victim's hair with the help of hospital security, Grissman said.

Gas price price rises were \"the straw that broke the camel's back,\" added Ackerman, who is also the editor-in-chief of the Mexican Law Review. \"When you link this to Trump you have a lot of fear that if Mexico doesn't defend itself the economy is going to go down the tubes.\" Photos: Outrage Across Mexico as Gas Hike Sparks Protests, Looting So \"these protests are not just about gas \u2014 Mexico has been a tinderbox for a long time,\" he said. Ackerman tied the recent protests to mass demonstrations that swept Mexico after the disappearance of 43 teaching students in 2014 , which became one of the highest-profile human rights cases in the country's history. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, right, listens as Luis Videgaray, left, takes the oath of office as Mexico's new Foreign Relations Secretary, at the Los Pinos presidential residence in Mexico City on Jan. 4. Marco Ugarte / AP Ackerman pointed to a handful of state governors and ex-governors who have gone on the run suspected of having pocketed millions by money laundering, graft and links to the criminal gangs, all examples of the rampant official corruption that has also angered the population. \"The general impression is not an impression \u2014 it is the reality of impunity,\" he said. Turbulent January Trump's words are not abstract threats for the United States' southern neighbor. Between 1965 and 2015, some 16 million Mexicans migrated to the U.S., according to Pew \u2014 one of the great movements of people in the last century. And of the 11.1 million unauthorized migrants in the U.S. in 2014, more than half were Mexican, Pew reports . Millions of Mexicans have relatives in the U.S. \u2014 or have spent time there themselves \u2014 so Trump's words alarm many. A man urges fellow demonstrators to calm down as they vandalize the Government Palace during a protest against the rising prices of gasoline at the Macroplaza in Monterrey on Jan. 5. DANIEL BECERRIL / Reuters Some are also conscious the country lost much of its territory to the U.S. in the mid-19th century, and Trump's perceived bullying taps into deep-seated fears that America is still trying to push around its southern neighbor. More recently, Trump pressured a number of companies to halt expansion plans in Mexico. On Jan. 3, Ford announced it was scrapping plans to build a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico . While the move was hailed as a victory for the president-elect, the move did not reverse the central decision the car maker made in April. Still, Trump's apparent ability to convince companies to change course has spooked financial markets, with the peso hitting historic lows against the dollar. On Monday, new data showed that December's annual inflation rose at the fastest pace in two years, promising further pain for the average Mexican. And to make matters worse for so many, the government does not appear to be standing up to Trump \u2014 on the contrary, according to columnist Arturo Balderas. \"Until now, our government has not had a clear and timely response to [Trump's proposed] draconian tariffs ... to defend the access of cars made in Mexico to the American market,\" he wote in a column in La Jornada newspaper . If a strong response is not being prepared, he warned, a \"turbulent January could last much longer than a month.\" F. Brinley Bruton ",

    "text": "Jolted by Deaths, Obama Found His Voice on Race Tensions across the country prompted the president to abandon his early reticence on race again and again. By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and YAMICHE ALCINDOR JAN. 14, 2017 WASHINGTON \u2014 Only weeks after 70 million Americans chose a black man for president, shattering a racial barrier that had stood for the entirety of the nation\u2019s 232-year history, no one in the White House, especially the man in the Oval Office, wanted to talk about race. President Obama had made a pragmatic calculation in January 2009, as the financial crisis drove communities across the United States toward economic collapse. Whatever he did for African-Americans, whose neighborhoods were suffering more than others, he would not describe as efforts to specifically help Black America. Mr. Obama made the decision knowing how powerfully his election had raised the hopes of African-Americans \u2014 and knowing that no matter what he did, it would not be seen as enough. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018They are going to hate us one day,\u2019\u201d said Melody Barnes, who is black and served as Mr. Obama\u2019s first domestic policy adviser, recalling her sadness when she stood in an auditorium in those early months as a crowd cheered for the success of the new president. \u201cI knew that we couldn\u2019t do everything that people wanted to meet those expectations.\u201d Continue reading the main story The fear inside the West Wing was that promoting a \u201cblack agenda\u201d and aiming programs directly at African-Americans at a time of widespread economic anxiety would provoke a white backlash \u2014 the kind that, years later, White House officials would view as helping to elect Donald J. Trump. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cAt a minimum, that would have been tone deaf,\u201d said Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as the nation\u2019s first African-American attorney general during much of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, \u201cand at worst, would have created a reaction in the larger community that would have prevented the things you wanted to do.\u201d Mr. Obama, who had grown up straddling two worlds as the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas, wanted to be the president of all America. Framing his efforts in racial terms could exacerbate something that was already simmering, he thought. \u201cThe most important thing I can do is to lift the economy over all,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters in the summer of 2009 when he was asked about doing more to help African-Americans recover economically. Video Obama\u2019s Evolving Approach to Race President Obama\u2019s comments on racial issues in America changed from an initial reticence to a final bluntness. Michael D. Shear looks back on how his tone shifted during his presidency. Publish Date January 14, 2017. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed But over the next seven and a half years, racial tensions across the country forced Mr. Obama to abandon his early reticence on race again and again. Ultimately he led a national conversation on race ignited by spasms of violence \u2014 police shootings and protests in Florida, South Carolina, Missouri and elsewhere. Inside the White House, aides recall them as among his most painful moments as president. \u201cAfter my election there was talk of a post-racial America,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his farewell speech on Tuesday in Chicago, reflecting on the threat that racial strife poses for the country\u2019s democratic ideals. \u201cSuch a vision, however well intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\u201d After he leaves office, Mr. Obama will continue that conversation in work for My Brother\u2019s Keeper and other programs to help black youths. There is plenty to do. As much as his once-unthinkable presidency has inspired and empowered African-Americans, black unemployment is still about double that for whites. Nearly a quarter of blacks are living in poverty, almost the same as in 1976. \u201cHe made it seem like everything was all good, and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Thelonious Stokes, 21, a black artist whose experiences of being racially profiled in Chicago left him jaded about the state of race relations. \u201cWe almost needed Trump to show the true state of America.\u201d The \u2018Beer Summit\u2019 Backlash Continue reading the main story Photo From left, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., Sgt. James Crowley of the Cambridge, Mass., police and Mr. Obama gathered at the White House in 2009 for a meeting that became known as the beer summit. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Mr. Obama\u2019s earliest public reflection about race as president backfired. Asked about a black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., a friend of Mr. Obama\u2019s who was arrested in July 2009 trying to enter his own house by a white officer, Mr. Obama immediately took sides. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt is fair to say,\u201d the president said six days after the arrest at a prime-time news conference, \u201cthat the Cambridge police acted stupidly.\u201d Those words \u2014 and the frenzied reaction to them \u2014 helped deepen the caution about racial issues inside the White House. For days, the president\u2019s critique of the arresting officer dominated the news and the morning staff meetings in the West Wing. Robert Gibbs, the press secretary, was especially agitated, his colleagues recalled, and argued that the White House had to do something to change the subject. Mr. Gibbs succeeded in pushing for what the news media quickly labeled a \u201cbeer summit\u201d on the edge of the Rose Garden in the White House, where Mr. Gates and the arresting officer, Sgt. James Crowley, joined Mr. Obama over beer for a discussion . \u201cIt had to be cauterized in a way that it would stop leading the news,\u201d Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama\u2019s closest adviser, conceded. Professor Gates, for one, was pleased. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody but Barack Obama would have thought about bringing us together,\u201d he said at the time. As a candidate for president in 2008, Mr. Obama had drawn praise for confronting racial divisions during a powerful speech he delivered about his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., who had characterized the United States as fundamentally racist and the government as corrupt. \u201cThe profound mistake of Reverend Wright\u2019s sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society. It\u2019s that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress had been made,\u201d Mr. Obama said that March day in Philadelphia, urging people to move beyond old racial wounds. \u201cLet us be our brother\u2019s keeper, Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister\u2019s keeper. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.\u201d The Obama Era Articles in this series will explore the sweeping change that President Obama has brought to the nation, and how the presidency has changed him.

But the beer summit was deeply disturbing to many of the president\u2019s African-American advisers, who thought he should not have backed down. The officer had acted stupidly, they thought, and the nation\u2019s first black president ought to be able to say so. The meeting \u201cwas demeaning and diminished his leadership and his voice at that moment,\u201d one of them recalled, asking for anonymity to bluntly discuss the topic. \u201cPeople thought we were being punked. I got so many emails, so many phone calls from people I respected: \u2018He was right. Why are you backpedaling?\u2019\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Inside the West Wing, the impact was clear. Mr. Obama would have to be more cautious when it came to racial issues, particularly ahead of the 2012 re-election campaign. The issue of race was too divisive at a time when Mr. Obama needed to emphasize inclusion. \u201cWhat it did teach us is that you just have to be careful about the words that you choose,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you shy away from issues that arise that deal with race, just as he didn\u2019t shy away from Reverend Wright. But you have to be sensitive to a long history of people reacting strongly to the topic.\u201d Outside the White House, people noticed, too: \u201cHe plainly arrested him because he was black,\u201d said Edward G. Robinson Sr., who is black and works at a box factory in Cleveland. Mr. Obama \u201cbacktracked because he wanted to be everybody\u2019s president.\u201d Like others, Mr. Robinson said the president was met with racially motivated disrespect in Washington, and pointed to the moment when a white Republican lawmaker yelled, \u201cYou lie!\u201d at the president during a congressional address. The White House would go on to publish reports about its efforts to help African-Americans, including details about the impact that the Affordable Care Act was having to help poor blacks. But Mr. Obama rarely talked about race publicly during the next few years. A Personal Connection Continue reading the main story Photo Protesters in New York\u2019s Union Square in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times The president\u2019s voice was shaking with emotion. \u201cIf I had a son he would look like Trayvon Martin,\u201d Mr. Obama told Ms. Jarrett and David Plouffe, his senior adviser and former campaign manager, as the three talked in the Oval Office about what the president should say publicly about the death of the 17-year-old African-American at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. \u201cI am going to say that.\u201d It was March 2012, nearly three years after the beer summit. The specter of that meeting still hovered and Mr. Obama was, in a sense, taking sides again. But in personalizing the shooting, his aides recalled, Mr. Obama\u2019s hope was that people might view African-African boys differently if they saw Trayvon through the president\u2019s own eyes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Obama headed out to the Rose Garden, announced his nomination of a new World Bank president, then took the question from a reporter that everyone knew was coming: \u201cCan you comment on the Trayvon Martin case, sir?\u201d Mr. Obama called it a tragedy , said he was glad the Justice Department was looking into it, reflected on how the nation was doing necessary soul searching and then concluded: \u201cBut my main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. If I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon.\u2019\u2019 Moments after Mr. Obama returned to the Oval Office, Gene Sperling, one of his top economic advisers, stopped by with tears in his eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what that will mean to my son,\u201d Mr. Sperling, who is white and is married to an African-American woman, told the president, according to a colleague who was there at the time. One of President Obama\u2019s lasting legacies may be the symbolic impact on the generation for whom \u201cpresident of the United States\u201d has always referred to a black man. This time, the president\u2019s comments were embraced by many outside the White House, too. Media reports focused on the emotion Mr. Obama had displayed \u2014 rare for a politician whose usual demeanor was cool and professorial. \u201cFor him to say things like that in front of the entire country and the world, I think sends a strong message to people,\u201d Ryan Shultz, 33, an art teacher in Chicago who is white, said in a recent interview. But others viewed the president\u2019s comments that day as a continuing affront to police officers and a saw in them a willingness to take sides in the racial debate. For at least one person, it went further. Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine parishioners in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, later said he was inspired to kill because of media coverage of Trayvon\u2019s shooting. \u201cCrime is still bad and police are still shooting black people left and right,\u201d Mr. Shultz said. \u201cI live in Chicago \u2014 a murder capital of the United States \u2014 and it\u2019s crazy and it hasn\u2019t gotten that much better, I don\u2019t think.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Photo The police and demonstrators clashed in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014 after a white officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Credit Whitney Curtis for The New York Times Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Mo., shortly after noon on Aug. 9, 2014. Only minutes before, Mr. Obama had arrived on Martha\u2019s Vineyard for his summer vacation, which would soon be dominated by how to respond to the racial violence that Mr. Brown\u2019s death unleashed. The president and his aides, including Mr. Holder and Ms. Jarrett, who were also vacationing on the island, made urgent calls to Missouri\u2019s governor, state police officials and civil rights leaders. They debated whether Mr. Obama should go to Ferguson, and decided against it, knowing that a presidential visit would be disruptive. Mr. Holder would go instead .

Privacy Policy But the more urgent question for the three of them was how to weigh in. The president was wary of putting his thumb on the scale in a case destined to be investigated by the federal authorities. But it was just as clear that tensions between the police and African-Americans were increasing \u2014 not only in Ferguson, but also around the country. If Mr. Obama wasn\u2019t the right person to step into that issue, who was? \u201cYou want to try to calm the situation,\u201d Mr. Holder said, recalling the discussions he had with the president and Ms. Jarrett about what to say. \u201cYou want to reassure the community that an investigation will be done and done fully. But you want to make sure that the people in law enforcement know it is done fairly.\u201d \u201cThere was that trust gap,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was something that had to be dealt with.\u201d As the violence worsened, Mr. Holder, Mr. Obama and Ms. Jarrett concluded that the president needed to denounce the violence \u2014 and at the same time criticize the police for their conduct during the protests. \u201cThere is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,\u201d the president said in a televised statement on Aug. 14 from Edgartown, Mass. But he added, \u201cThere\u2019s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.\u201d Photo A demonstrator asking Mr. Obama to visit Missouri during the unrest there. The president instead sent his attorney general to represent the administration. Credit Whitney Curtis for The New York Times For the rest of his presidency, Mr. Obama would strive for the balance he struck in his remarks that day: empathy and understanding for African-Americans and support for the police and the rule of law. But however he weighed in, the events in Ferguson made clear that he could no longer hang back and instead had to lead a national debate about race, violence and unity. \u201cOnce it was so in America\u2019s face, police brutality, it blew the circuit,\u201d said Bill Burton, an African-American who served as deputy White House press secretary during the first term. \u201cIt made it possible to have that conversation that our country had actively not been having.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Inevitably, Mr. Obama\u2019s striving for balance often left him vilified by both sides. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, rebuked Mr. Obama for not being \u201chelpful\u201d in discussing police tactics from his vacation. Years later, Mr. Pasco told NPR that the president often struck the wrong tone when he talked about race and policing. \u201cThe president has never been a police officer. He\u2019s never walked in a police officer\u2019s shoes,\u201d Mr. Pasco said last July. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a breakdown in communication more than there is a breakdown in insincerity or intent.\u201d Ja\u2019Mal Green, a 21-year-old Black Lives Matter activist based in Chicago, said he thought Mr. Obama \u201cignored\u201d the calls of organizers for federal policy and funding aimed at stopping police brutality. Mr. Green said he also grew tired of hearing Mr. Obama couple his grief for families in racially charged shooting episodes with statements supporting white police officers. \u201cHe is trying to walk a neutral line and he wants to please both sides,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cHe wants to please black people and then he wants to please police supporters and police officers and police unions. But sometimes you have to pick a side in situations. You need to pick your time when you fight for home or you\u2019ll just have everybody hating you.\u2019\u201d Mr. Stokes, the 21-year-old artist from Chicago, felt similarly disappointed. \u201cChicago is the exact same,\u201d Mr. Stokes said. \u201cHe simply opened up, maybe, a lane for young men like me to just maybe be accepted a little bit more to people that don\u2019t accept educated black people. But that\u2019s it, literally. White America is still running everything, and that means that nothing is changing.\u201d A Time for Grace Continue reading the main story Photo Mr. Obama embraced Eliana Pinckney at a memorial service for her father, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Less than a year after Mr. Brown\u2019s death in Ferguson, on June 17, 2015, nine African-American parishioners, including a pastor, were gunned down by a 21-year-old white supremacist during a church meeting in Charleston. Two days later, the victims\u2019 families addressed Mr. Roof , the gunman, at a court hearing, where one by one they forgave him. \u201cYou took something very precious away from me,\u201d Nadine Collier, the daughter of 70-year-old Ethel Lance, told Mr. Roof, as her voice rose in anguish. \u201cI will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.\u201d It was an extraordinary scene, broadcast live on television, which moved many who saw it to tears. Mr. Obama was traveling and did not see it in real time, but when Eric Schultz, the deputy press secretary, read Ms. Collier\u2019s words out loud to Mr. Obama on Marine One , the presidential helicopter, the president was awed by what he heard. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHe said, \u2018That\u2019s what we need to recognize here, the ability of people to forgive on the worst day of their lives.\u2019 It really struck him,\u201d Ms Jarrett recalled. \u201cWe sat there and talked about it on the helicopter. About that quality, the amazing grace.\u201d Later, in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama struggled with his chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, to come up with the right words for a eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the pastor of the Charleston church and a friend of the president\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to say,\u201d Mr. Keenan told Mr. Obama, according to Ms. Jarrett. \u201cYou\u2019ve said everything that one could possibly say on the subject.\u201d Eventually, the president decided that instead of talking about guns he would talk about what black churches stood for and the meaning of grace. \u201cIt would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for, I believe, if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again,\u201d the president told a hushed audience at the memorial service. \u201cOnce the eulogies have been delivered, once the TV cameras move on, to go back to business as usual \u2014 that\u2019s what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society. To settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change \u2014 that\u2019s how we lose our way again.\u201d The week before, during a podcast interview with Marc Maron , the comedian, Mr. Obama had caused a minor stir by using the word \u201cnigger\u201d in answering a question about race relations. He knew it would cause a ripple, an aide with him recalled, but he shrugged. At the beginning of his term, the podcast could have caused a fury and Mr. Obama might have pulled back again. But events in the country \u2014 especially the deaths of young black men \u2014 had given him more opportunities to engage the topic. Mr. Pinckney\u2019s funeral was one of them. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to just whistle in the wind,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for a chance to talk to people when they are ready to hear him. He doesn\u2019t ignore moments.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Mississippi City Under Fire For Referring to MLK Day as 'Great Americans Day' By David Caplan Jan 14, 2017, 12:52 AM ET 0 Shares Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images Welcome to Mississippi Email So much for the New South. That was a reaction elicited by a tweet posted by the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, Friday night which referred to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as \"Great Americans Day\" -- an apparent attempt to also honor the birth of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. \"Non-emergency municipal offices in Biloxi will be closed on Monday in observance of Great Americans Day,\" read the tweet. Non-emergency municipal offices in Biloxi will be closed on Monday in observance of Great Americans Day. \u2014 City of Biloxi (@CityofBiloxi) January 13, 2017 A backlash immediately ensued, with thousands of angry individuals taking to the city's social media accounts to question why the Gulf Coast city didn't refer to Monday as the federally-observed holiday named in honor of one of the most iconic civil rights leaders. City of Biloxi under fire for 'Great Americans Day' post https://t.co/ab0fO3sOBE pic.twitter.com/jD2dM1q0jY \u2014 WLOX (@WLOX) January 14, 2017 The city later edited a similarly-worded Facebook post, to describe \"Great Americans Day\" as \"a state-named holiday.\" But that assertion isn't exactly the case: The list of state holidays on the government of Mississippi's website does not list either Martin Luther King, Jr. Day nor \"Great Americans Day.\" It does, however, cite the state's observance of both King and Lee's birthdays on the third Monday of January -- without explicitly naming the day. In fact, the genesis of \"Great Americans Day\" appears to stem from the municipal level: ABC affiliate WLOX reports that the name change was introduced to city council on Dec. 23, 1985, and approved on Dec. 31, 1985. And the city of Biloxi echoed that sentiment in a hastily-written statement following the backlash: \"Biloxi Mayor Andrew 'FoFo' Gilich, responding to a flurry of comments about a city tweet today referring to Monday as 'Great Americans Day,' believes the Biloxi City Council on Tuesday should take steps to update the city's Code of Ordinances to reflect the official federal name of the holiday, 'Birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr .,' commonly known as 'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day,\" read the statement. Gilich says in the statement, \"In my opinion that is the appropriate step to take, for the holiday to have the same name as the federal holiday. This city's longstanding support of our annual MLK celebrations speaks volumes about our support for this holiday. In fact, we've always celebrated this day as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\" From Mayor Andrew \"FoFo\" Gilich: \"As far as I'm concerned, it's called 'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.'\" \u2014 City of Biloxi (@CityofBiloxi) January 14, 2017 The city's statement also acknowledges that the city council did indeed pass a motion to honor other notable Americans. \"The issue arose this afternoon when the city tweeted a one-line sentence that said non-emergency city offices would be closed on Monday 'in observance of Great Americans Day,\" reads the statement. It continues, \"The name has since been traced back to a City Council on Dec. 23, 1985 to proclaim the third Monday of every January 'to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other great Americans who have made important contributions to the birth, growth and evolution of this country.'\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Twitter YouTube Just months after a launch pad explosion thwarted its last attempt, SpaceX has successfully launched an unmanned rocket into orbit. The launch, which unfolded Saturday at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base, marked a crucial \u2014 and expensive \u2014 test for the private space company in the aftermath of its recent, very visible misfire . SpaceX Rocket And Its Cargo Explode On Launch Pad In Florida [VIDEO] Shortly after the launch, the two-stage rocket detached its first stage, which subsequently landed safely on a platform in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX live-streamed the entire process along the way. You can watch it here or play the video embedded at the top of this post. The Falcon 9 rocket is bearing 10 commercial satellites for Iridium Communications, which currently operates a network of dozens of mobile communications satellites in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX is under contract with Iridium to launch at least 70 satellites into orbit in a series of seven launches for the company \u2014 beginning with Saturday's batch. The new satellites will replace the current network, in \"what will be one of the largest 'tech upgrades' in history,\" according to a press release from SpaceX . Still, a cloud of uncertainty hung over the launch, after an explosion left a wreckage of last September's test in Cape Canaveral, Fla. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said at the time that the blast came while workers were still loading propellant into the rocket, though no one was physically harmed in the accident. In addition to destroying the rocket itself \u2014 a Falcon 9, like the rocket being launched Saturday \u2014 last year's blast also obliterated a $200 million communications satellite. The Israeli satellite \"had been leased by Facebook as part of a project to bring high-speed internet to parts of Africa,\" NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reports for our Newscast unit. Article continues after sponsorship A months-long investigation by SpaceX dug into what went wrong \u2014 \"the toughest puzzle to solve that we've ever had to solve,\" Musk said. That probe wrapped up earlier this month, concluding the accident \"was triggered by the failure of a high-pressure helium tank, one of three used to pressurize the second stage liquid oxygen tank,\" according to CBS News . The Federal Aviation Administration then signed off on that investigation, approving the new licence for Saturday's launch. Prior to last year's accident, SpaceX had managed a string of high-profile successes, including landing a Falcon 9 on a floating barge. ",

Both houses of Congress controlled by the president\u2019s party Note: During George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, Democrats controlled the Senate for part of 2001 and all of 2002. Republican leaders say Obama never offered half a loaf \u2014 or anything like it. They say he didn\u2019t have the legislative experience to cut deals and was too aloof to engage in the fine art of wining and dining lawmakers to his side. \u201cAlmost without exception, President Obama begins serious policy discussions by explaining why everyone else is wrong,\u201d McConnell wrote in his 2016 autobiography. \u201cThe conversation would last as long as it took the President to feel satisfied that his soliloquy had outlined the issue well enough for me to understand,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSpeaker Boehner famously put the phone on his desk and carried on a separate conversation during one of these exchanges with the President. I never put the phone down, but on one occasion, I did watch at least an inning of baseball.\u201d Both political parties blame the other for the widening partisan divide. But the reasons are more complex and have evolved in recent decades. House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, left, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky speak to reporters outside the White House after meeting with Obama and other congressional  leaders to discuss the economy and jobs in February 2010. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / Associated Press) In the 1960s and 1970s, the Democratic and Republican parties had broad coalitions of liberals, moderates and conservatives. Presidents could forge bipartisan consensus for major legislation, from civil rights to environmental protection. But the spirit of compromise weakened in the 1980s as Republicans grew more consistently conservative and Democrats more reliably liberal. ADVERTISEMENT The divide widened under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, and worsened further under Obama. Higher levels of education, the advent of social media, greater racial diversity, increased income inequality, and changes in the economy and where Americans live probably all played a role. To the extent that Obama and Republicans in Congress have aggravated the gap, the two sides have very different explanations. As Obama tells it, the story began early in his first term as he rode to Capitol Hill in the presidential limousine. He was going to meet with Rep. John A. Boehner of Ohio, then the House minority leader, to discuss ways to stimulate the economy to avert a depression after the housing market collapse at the end of the Bush administration. Obama said he had phoned Boehner and asked to \u201ccome up to your caucus and talk.\u201d \u201cAs I\u2019m driving over, he puts out a press release saying, \u2018We\u2019re against it,\u2019\u201d Obama told friends later, referring to the alert he saw on an aide\u2019s BlackBerry. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t talked to anybody yet!\u201d Dozens of interviews with Obama aides and the president himself suggest that the limousine story, which he told and retold over the years, deeply colored his thinking about his GOP adversaries. Obama holds a document containing Republican policy proposals given to him by Boehner in January 2010. (Charles Dharapak / Associated Press) Boehner\u2019s team has a different memory of the incident. They say it wasn\u2019t their intransigence that started the gridlock of the last eight years, but Obama\u2019s initial approach to them. They say he made clear that the Democratic majority in Congress, led by the newly elected Democratic president, would push through a economic stimulus bill with or without Republican support. Obama\u2019s handling of the stimulus bill was \u201cthe original sin\u201d of his young administration, \u201csetting the course of partisanship and confrontation,\u201d former Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. \u201cThere\u2019s an argument to be made that the history of the Obama presidency would have been very different if he had insisted on bipartisan discussions and input on the stimulus bill,\u201d Steel said. \u201c There\u2019s an argument to be made that the history of the Obama presidency would have been very different if he had insisted on bipartisan discussions and input on the stimulus bill. \u201d \u2014 Michael Steel, former spokesman for John Boehner Share this quote Obama and Boehner play golf at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., in June 2011. (Charles Dharapak / Associated Press) In the end, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the stimulus was formally known, passed Congress in February 2009 with three Republican votes in the Senate and none in the House. Mutual recriminations only worsened later that year when the administration and Congress negotiated over Obama\u2019s proposed healthcare reform law. On that, the two sides again share a story but give it different interpretations. For months, White House and Senate staffs shuttled up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, chasing potential compromises but finding none. Eager to break the impasse, Obama invited Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a key committee chairman, and several other lawmakers to the Oval Office for a session he thought could clear the way. He set up the meeting the way he had learned from Republicans in the Illinois Senate: No public arrival. No parade before reporters. Just a few aides and officials in the room.

Grassley, with his low-key manners and graying hair, looked like the negotiating partners of Obama\u2019s past. Like Obama, he had done deals across party lines before. It was early August. They sat in the Oval Office, Obama cross-legged in an armchair, Grassley sitting back on a beige couch. Obama worked his way down a list of ideas, asking if any could be made to work. He asked what he could do to get broader support. After a pause, according to a White House aide who was present, Grassley leaned toward the president and looked him in the eye. \u201cYou know what, Mr. President?\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to admit \u2014 there\u2019s no change that allows me to vote for this thing.\u201d Obama and top advisors told that story often later. To them, it marked the moment they realized that Republicans were not prepared, under almost any circumstances, to consider the president\u2019s top domestic priority. The moment symbolized something else for Grassley. Obama had a Democratic plan \u2014 government-based healthcare coverage \u2014 and was willing to tweak it only to pick up enough Republicans to allow the White House to claim it had bipartisan support. Grassley said he wouldn\u2019t play that game. \u201cI said to the president, \u2018That\u2019s not bipartisanship,\u2019\u201d he recalled. Obama signs the Affordable Care Act in the East Room of the White House on March 23, 2010. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) For Obama, who believed in universal healthcare \u2014 or something close to it \u2014 the issue was simple. What was the point of winning the White House if you couldn\u2019t help people as you\u2019d promised? In his view, Democrats already had compromised considerably. They had given up the left\u2019s dream of a \u201csingle payer\u201d system of government insurance for everyone, and had instead proposed a system that relied on commercial insurers, something Republicans had historically backed. The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, passed in early 2010 without a single Republican vote. The party-line dispute contributed to the Democrats\u2019 heavy losses in midterm elections later that year, giving Republicans control of both houses of Congress. After that, the stalemate was set. Democrats complained that Republicans wouldn\u2019t negotiate in good faith, or said GOP leaders couldn\u2019t sell a compromise to the party\u2019s increasingly powerful tea party wing. Republicans said Obama was trying to ram his political agenda \u2014 including cap-and-trade legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and an overhaul of immigration laws \u2014 down their throats. After bitter debate, the climate change bill was passed by the House but was never brought to a vote in the Senate, where it died. In 2013, the opposite occurred for immigration reform. It narrowly passed the Senate, but died without a vote in the House. After that, Obama increasingly used executive authority to order rule changes for the environment, immigration, unemployment and other issues. President-elect Donald Trump can reverse or amend many of them as soon as he takes office. Jim Manley, a former top aide to then-Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, says Republicans still remember Obama\u2019s boast to GOP leaders in the Oval Office in 2009. \u201cElections have consequences,\u201d the new president told them. \u201cThey\u2019ve never forgotten that,\u201d Manley said.

    "text": "advertisement An ice storm crawling across America's midsection this weekend \u2014 threatening about 44 million people from Texas to the Mid-Atlantic \u2014 is freezing roadways and creating treacherous driving conditions. The storm is already being blamed for three deaths. One person died Saturday morning in Missouri after a van carrying 12 people rolled over on a highway north of Kansas City, ejecting the driver. Meanwhile, near Weatherford, Oklahoma, a truck driver died after losing control of his semi on Interstate 40, where icy surfaces caused at least a dozen accidents. On Friday, a person was killed in a crash on Interstate 55, north of Crystal City, Missouri, amid the poor conditions. Missouri State Highway Patrol assists a vehicle that has slid off the highway due to icy conditions on Jan. 13, 2017. Missouri State Highway Patrol Police in Wichita, Kansas, said two people suffered minor injuries in a 20-car pileup Friday night, one of several accidents caused by the icy roads. The Kansas Army National Guard had already mobilized in advance of Saturday's storm, designating roughly 200 guardsmen to patrol key roads and help motorists stranded by the weather. The teams of soldiers are providing emergency transportation for law enforcers and other emergency responders, and prepared to make warming stations available at local armories. Related: Midwest Faces Mayhem As Ice Storm Marches Through Forecasters say as much as an inch of ice is expected to build up on roads throughout Kansas as well as Oklahoma, where a state of emergency remains in place. Ice storm warnings stretch from the Texas panhandle across Missouri and Iowa to Illinois. Scattered outages have also been reported, including about 2,500 in Springfield, Missouri. Meanwhile, winter storm watches are in effect in parts of eastern Colorado, Nebraska and Iowa, while freezing rain advisories have been called for the Ohio Valley and the Appalachians, The Weather Channel reported. Winter Storm #Jupiter will continue to bring significant ice accumulations to parts of Plains/Midwest this weekend: https://t.co/ktkEQBUsM0 pic.twitter.com/WiDbX446UJ \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) January 14, 2017 \"The good news is as we head toward ... (Sunday) night and into Monday, some warmer air tries to move northward, so some places that start off as freezing rain in the weekend should transition back over to rain,\" said Weather Channel storm specialist Greg Postel. As a precaution, the NFL has already moved back the noon Sunday playoff game in Kansas City between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers to after 7 p.m. CT to give enough time for the storm to pass and to clear roads. Forecasters warn that even as the weather warms up through the holiday weekend, another wave of cold air is right behind. Play ",

    "text": "Jan 14 2017, 7:46 pm ET How Drones Are Helping Scientists Study the Future of Whales by Tom Costello and Bradleigh Miranda Chance Share advertisement The sight of a 50-foot whale breaching is breathtaking. Water slides down the whale's back as it leaps above the surface, shooting spray in the air and then crashing back into the water. The powerful ocean giants make their own waves with mighty, mid-air twists and turns. Every now and then, a powerful spray blasts into the air from the creature's blow hole. The average onlooker just sees a cloud of vapor, but marine biologists view it as important genetic material. Researchers at Ocean Alliance, a nonprofit dedicated to conservation efforts, are using drones capture the the breathtaking image with aerial photography \u2014 as well as the genetic material in petri dishes. Ocean Alliance created the \"Snotbot,\" a drone they designed to capture both images of the whales and live biological samples of the \"snot\" the animals exhale through their blow holes. The team mounted petri dishes to the drone's base so that when the drone hovers above a breaching whale, the propellers create a vortex. This pushes the whale's spray down into the sample trays. Related: SeaWorld to End Breeding Program for Orcas \"We know this tool is replicable and powerful,\" Ocean Alliance CEO Dr. Iain Kerr said. He and his team have used the Snotbot to collect images and samples from blue whales in Mexico, right whales in Argentina and humpback whales in Alaska. This fresh approach allows biologists to gather new insight into the world's largest creatures without them even knowing it. Typically, scientists need to biopsy an animal in order to collect biological data. \"To do that you need to get pretty close to the whale and it's hardly a non-invasive procedure,\" Kerr said. \"When someone takes blood from us, we know it and we don't like it.\" In this Jan. 23, 2005 file photo, a humpback whale leaps out of the water in the channel off the town of Lahaina on the island of Maui in Hawaii. AP Taking a blood sample from a blue whale, weighing in at 150 tons, is no easy task. They are so enormous that a human could stand up in the right ventricle of a blue whale's heart, Kerr said. Imagine trying to capture photos of these giants from the dock of a 13-foot research boat. The gray whale is 50 feet and the blue whale is 100 feet \u2014 only a drone, collecting images overhead, can put their size into perspective. Related: Japan's Whaling Fleet Set to Embark on Hunt for 333 Minke Whales The aerial point of view allows Ocean Alliance to capture identifying photos and intimate moments, like a mother nursing her calf. The animals are more likely to act natural because they probably think the drone is a bird, Kerr said. That means less stress for the whales and a more accurate biological sample. For the first time ever, the team is able to peer into the lungs of the world's largest animals without disturbing them. The samples they collect contain a biological treasure trove of mammalian DNA, microbiome, stress and pregnancy hormones. At Oregon State University, Professor Scott Baker is adding the information collected by the Snotbot to a catalog of 3,000 whales that he and his team have been studying for 35 years. He analyzes the whales' identities by looking at age, health and any signs of environmental threats. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about learning about this population now, but understanding it over the next 10, 20 or 50 years.\u201d \"The same way you would in the case of a human forensic analysis,\" Baker said, \"to tell us about its history in terms of its population, its associates and relatives.\" They compare the biological data to the aerial images captured by the drone and contribute the physical markings they see to the animals' identity profiles. As they continue to add information to the catalog, they can draw more and more conclusions about the future for the biggest animal on the planet. \"It's not just about learning about this population now, but understanding it over the next 10, 20 or 50 years,\" Baker said. In this July 11, 2008 file photo, a trio of humpback whales break the surface of the water as they work together in a group behavior known as \"bubble feeding\" off the coast of Cape Cod near Provincetown, Mass. AP Ocean Alliance doesn't plan to stop anytime soon. Kerr said that for whale biology, this innovative use of drones is just as groundbreaking as the 17th century invention of the microscope. He hopes other nonprofit groups will start using the technology responsibly in their research as well because it's a much cheaper option. \"There's probably a lot of charities in North America that can't afford a $50,000 research tool, but they can afford a $2,000 research tool,\" Kerr said. \"It's just amazing.\" While some whale populations are slowly recovering from near extinction, others are still in danger. Countries like Japan and Iceland still hunt whales, but Kerr said the new research could help save them. And hunting might not be the only problem. It's hard to know what has an effect on whales. There may be other human actions stressing them that researchers haven't even considered. \"We live on planet ocean,\" Kerr said. \"Humanity's future is in our oceans, so we want to know what human effects cause stress for these species. This Snotbot will help tell us that.\" Tom Costello ",

It starts at about $8 for an eight-foot-long metal strip at Home Depot, she said, and offers \u201ca clean, timeless look.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story LOOK FOR LEFTOVERS Don\u2019t pay for an entire slab of granite when all you need is a small piece to cover the top of a vanity. Stone fabricators like SMC Stone in Greenpoint, Brooklyn , and BCG Marble and Granite Fabricators in Hackensack, N.J., often sell remnants. The same goes for tile: Dawn DeLuca, a principal at Camille Rossy Cabinetry & Design , said she looks for closeouts at stores like Tiles Unlimited in Glendale, Queens , and on sites like Tilebar.com , where overstocked and discontinued lines are sold for as much as 80 percent off. Ms. DeLuca added that it pays to ask about closeouts at any remodeling store you happen to visit. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you see a showroom changing displays, run in! They will be happy to sell display models at steep discounts \u2014 everything from vanities to toilet bowls.\u201d And don\u2019t forget about Craigslist , where contractors and do-it-yourselfers often sell surplus. One recent listing offered 84 Bianco Carrara marble subway tiles for $50 with the following message: \u201cAccidentally purchased what we needed in sq. ft. instead of linear ft. \u2026 oops! Selling what we didn\u2019t need at half price.\u201d Photo Replace a boring old medicine cabinet with a handsome mirror. Credit Bruce Buck for The New York Times LOSE THE MEDICINE CABINET \u201cI opt, whenever possible, for a decorative mirror instead of a medicine cabinet,\u201d said Kelly Giesen, the founder of Kelly G Design in Manhattan. \u201cA mirror adds style to the space and opens up a wide choice of price options. You can also go as big as the room will support, so the space ends up looking bigger and more grand.\u201d HIT THE FLEA MARKET Ms. Giesen recently found a small iron table for $125 this way, and plans to use it as a sink console. \u201cThe style is unique and special,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd perfect for a bath, without breaking the bank.\u201d Just be sure to measure your flea market finds before buying, to ensure they\u2019re the right height, width and depth for your bathroom. CONSIDER THE COST OF LABOR \u201cMost people think about saving on material,\u201d said Raf Howery, the chief executive of the home-remodeling site Kukun , but they forget that labor can account for as much as 40 percent of the overall budget. Keeping the bathroom layout the same, so you don\u2019t have to move the plumbing, and \u201cchoosing products that do not require a huge amount of installation labor,\u201d Mr. Howery said, are some of the best ways to keep costs down. Cindy Albert, a designer at New Life Bath & Kitchen in Santa Maria, Calif., offered an example: Instead of spending $1,400 on tile for a recent bathroom renovation, she spent $2,000 on wall panels from Kohler\u2019s Choreograph line. The panels cost more, she explained, but because they took less time to install, her client saved about $2,500 on labor. AVOID \u201cBUILDER GRADE\u201d FIXTURES \u201cBuilder grade\u201d and \u201ccontractor grade\u201d are marketing terms for the most basic fixtures in a product line. And in this case, you get what you pay for: They tend to be made of less durable parts and can \u201cscratch and wear more quickly,\u201d said Leonard Kady , an architect in New York. Investing in a higher-grade fixture may cost more up front, but it could save you money in the long term. You may not see the words \u201cbuilder grade\u201d on the box, Mr. Kady added, but \u201csalespeople will let you know, as a point of comparison.\u201d Another clue: \u201cThe higher end tends to be heavier and feel solid.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story KEEP IT SIMPLE The number of handles required to operate the temperature and flow of the water in your shower and tub may not be high on your list of renovation priorities, but all those parts add up. \u201cMore valves equal higher costs,\u201d Mr. Kady said. A pressure balance valve with a single handle to control both the water temperature and flow is often cheaper than a thermostatic valve with two or more handles. \u201cEach valve has to be separately installed, and plumbing pipes have to meet those valves, which adds labor costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why fewer is better.\u201d When it comes to finishes, standard polished chrome is typically less expensive than other options. Kohler\u2019s Bancroft valve trim and handle in polished chrome, for example, sells for $244. The same model in brushed nickel costs $355. And if you have your heart set on an expensive material like marble, consider using it as an accent rather than covering the entire bathroom in it. That\u2019s what Marica McKeel , the founder of Studio MM, a Manhattan architecture firm, suggested when her client fell in love with a $20-a-square-foot marble tile and \u201chad to have it\u201d wall-to-wall in a large bathroom. Using the marble on the floor, and a simple white subway tile in the shower, \u201cnot only saved our client more than $1,600,\u201d Ms. McKeel said, \u201cit allowed the marble tile to stand out and become the star of the show.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on October 2, 2016, on Page RE6 of the New York edition with the headline: The Bathroom Revisited.

John Lewis, D-Ga., delivers remarks in front of a freedom bell during the \"Let Freedom Ring\" commemoration event in 2013. Pool/Getty Images Donald Trump lashed out at civil rights hero John Lewis on Twitter Saturday morning, a day after the Georgia Democratic congressman said in an interview he didn't view the president-elect as \"legitimate\" amid questions of Russia's interference in the U.S. elections. Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to...... \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 While Trump has a well-known tendency to take to social media to push back against any slight against him, such a strongly-worded rebuke of Lewis and the criticism of his majority-black district was jarring on the holiday weekend celebrating the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders and a top lieutenant of King's, helping organize the March on Washington in 1963 and marching with King across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., in 1965, where his skull was fractured. Lewis said during an NBC interview on Friday that he didn't view Trump as a \"legitimate president\" after reports that Russia had worked to influence the election in Trump's favor and to discredit Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's candidacy. Trump has largely dismissed those reports and questioned the validity of U.S. intelligence findings, frequently praising Russia and its president Vladimir Putin throughout the campaign and the election. Article continues after sponsorship Lewis also said he wouldn't be attending Trump's inauguration on Friday, making it the first he's missed since he was elected to Congress in 1986. \"You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right,\" Lewis told \"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd. Nebraska GOP Sen. Ben Sasse, a frequent critic of Trump during the campaign, defended Lewis on Twitter. On Friday, he'd tweeted a message to Lewis asking him to reconsider attending the inauguration. John Lewis and his \"talk\" have changed the world. https://t.co/qeUloAkeTx https://t.co/aH2vDLjKk9 \u2014 Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) January 14, 2017 Trump also claimed that Lewis's Atlanta-based district was \"in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested).\" As the Atlanta Journal Constitution notes, the district is about 58 percent black, 33 percent white and has a growing Hispanic population. It includes the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the headquarters of Coca Cola and Delta Air Lines. It also includes several top colleges such as the historically black Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University, along with Emory University and Georgia Tech. And while the district does have an 8.2 percent unemployment rate, higher than the national average of just below 5 percent, more than 40 percent in the district have a bachelor's degree or higher, higher than the national average .

    "text": "SpaceX Returns to Flight With Successful Falcon 9 Launch By Erin Dooley Jan 14, 2017, 3:53 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Moment SpaceX Rocket Explodes at Launch Site 0 Shares Email SpaceX 's Falcon 9 returned to flight, launching successfully from Vandenburg Air Force Base in California today, just four and a half months after a fiery explosion destroyed Facebook's AMOS-6 satellite. An investigation conducted by SpaceX (with assists from the Air Force, NASA , and the National Transportation Safety Board) concluded that the September 1 explosion was likely caused by a failure of a pressurized second-stage tank. The company, which is run by billionaire Elon Musk , vowed to change the fueling procedures to prevent the incident from recurring, and the FAA granted a launch license. The launch today delivered 10 Iridium satellites to low-earth orbit for use in mobile communications. After separation, the rocket\u2019s first stage landed on the droneship \u201cJust Read the Instructions,\u201d stationed in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX nailed a similar droneship landing back in April. Returning the first stage to earth enables the company to reuse the rocket, drastically reducing the cost of launch. Musk has said his ultimate goal is to start a colony on Mars by reducing the cost of a one-way trip from $10 billion per person to just $200,000. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Richard Drew, AP) Tony-winning actress/singer Jennifer Holliday has pulled out of the lineup for Donald Trump's\u00a0 Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration , USA TODAY confirmed. The move comes a day after Holliday's agent, Jeff Epstein, told USA TODAY via email that she verbally accepted an offer from the Trump inaugural committee. \"We want to be clear that an offer does not constitute a contract,\" he noted. On Friday evening, she defended her participation to the New York Times , saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have a dog in this fight,\" she said. \"I\u2019m just a singer, and it\u2019s a welcome concert for the people on the Mall.\u201d The Dreamgirls star,\u00a0whose signature song\u00a0And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\u00a0has been lip-synced in countless drag shows, later\u00a0had second thoughts after reading a Daily Beast essay that called her participation \"heartbreaking to gay fans.\" Toby Keith, Jennifer Holliday: Who will perform at the inauguration? After learning that the gay icon had signed on to perform at the Trump show, Daily Beast writer Kevin Fallon wrote:\u00a0\"There\u2019s no separating the booking of any of these stars from the fact that performing at the inauguration \u2014 any inauguration, sure, but especially this one \u2014 is a political act. In the case of Holliday, it is an act that seems to defy everything her most passionate supporters stand for, and even issues she herself has supported throughout her career.\" In an open letter addressed to her \"beloved LGBT community\"\u00a0published Saturday by the Wrap.com and obtained by USA TODAY, Holliday declared:\u00a0\"I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!\u201d Holliday, who describes\u00a0herself as a \"neutral songbird\" and has performed for four presidents, explained, \"I was honestly just thinking that I wanted my voice to be\u00a0a healing and unifying force for hope through music to help our deeply polarized country. ... Regretfully, I did not take into consideration that my performing for the concert would actually instead be taken as a political act against my own personal beliefs and be mistaken for support of Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\" She called her initial agreement to perform \"a lapse of judgment,\" confessing she was \u201cuneducated on the issues that affect every American at this crucial time in history\" and apologizing \"for causing such dismay and heartbreak to my fans.\u201d \u201cPlease know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain,\" she wrote. \"The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you. \u2026 You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.\u201d Trump appears largely neutral on LGBT issues, telling CBS' 60 Minutes that he is \"fine\" with marriage equality, noting,\u00a0\"It was settled in the Supreme Court. It's done.\" He has also appeared supportive of Caitlyn Jenner's transition, inviting the transgender former Olympian, who is Republican, to use the restrooms at Trump Tower when the bathroom bill controversy was raging in North Carolina. Vice President-elect Mike Pence's actions while governor of Indiana, however, have raised concerns in the LGBT community. In 2015, the self-described \"evangelical Catholic\" signed into law the\u00a0 Religious Freedom Restoration Act . While the watered-down final bill \u00a0did\u00a0explicitly protect\u00a0sexual orientation and gender identity, it managed to anger both social conservatives and liberals, and opened a Pandora's box of legal discrimination against LGBT people, leading tech companies to boycott the state.

The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel brought up concerns about the Hawthorne space company\u2019s unconventional fueling operations... A major NASA safety advisory group urged the agency to scrutinize SpaceX \u2019s rocket fueling process ahead of future launches of astronauts to the International Space Station. The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel brought up concerns about the Hawthorne space company\u2019s unconventional fueling operations... (Samantha Masunaga) The company said\u00a0one of three such\u00a0tanks, inside the rocket\u2019s larger, second-stage liquid oxygen tank, failed,\u00a0probably after a buildup of liquid oxygen between the vessel\u2019s aluminum inner liner and its carbon overwrap ignited. The vessels store cold helium that maintains pressure in\u00a0the liquid oxygen tank. The FAA said last week\u00a0that it accepted the accident report and closed the investigation.\u00a0 SpaceX said it would change the configuration of the vessels so warmer helium could be loaded, as the investigation found that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to form a solid, exacerbating the possibility of oxygen getting trapped. The company also said it would change helium loading operations.\u00a0 A few weeks after the explosion, SpaceX said it expected to return to flight as soon as November. But that date slipped to December, and then January, as the investigation continued.\u00a0 The company initially had been planning to launch on Jan. 8, but the date was pushed back to Monday. The launch then was rescheduled for Saturday because of weather conditions. The 10 satellites SpaceX launched Saturday\u00a0will be operated by Iridium Communications Inc., and will be part of the McLean, Va., company\u2019s new satellite constellation to provide mobile communications services on the ground and in ships and airplanes.

A young John Lewis is seen in the foreground being clubbed by a state trooper during a civil rights protest in Selma, Ala., in 1965. (Associated Press) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter Unwilling to let criticism pass, Donald Trump on Saturday pilloried as\u00a0\u201call talk \u2026 no action\u201d national icon John Lewis, who was repeatedly beaten by police and nearly lost his life during protests in the long struggle for civil rights. Trump\u2019s Twitter comments about the Georgia congressman\u00a0came in response to Lewis\u2019\u00a0assertion in an interview Friday that he did not see Trump as a \u201clegitimate\u201d president because of Russian involvement in the defeat of his opponent, Hillary Clinton . The president-elect\u2019s comments were rife with irony. At the start of \u00a0a weekend dedicated to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Trump was using his potent social media platform to hurl insults at a civil rights leader. And the trigger for the outburst was doubt being raised about Trump\u2019s legitimacy, even after Trump himself led a more than five-year effort to delegitimize President Obama by falsely claiming that he was foreign born. Trump also used racially freighted language when he said that Lewis\u2019 Atlanta district was \u201ccrime infested\u201d and \u201cfalling apart.\u201d The district, which is mostly African American,\u00a0includes many\u00a0of the Atlanta area\u2019s most prominent\u00a0neighborhoods. A motel room once used by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to plan civil rights protests is the centerpiece of a new national monument in Alabama. President Obama signed an order creating the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument in one of his final acts as the nation's first black president.... A motel room once used by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to plan civil rights protests is the centerpiece of a new national monument in Alabama. President Obama signed an order creating the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument in one of his final acts as the nation's first black president.... (Associated Press) The furor,\u00a0along with continued investigations into the Russian activities, threatened to mar a period during which an\u00a0incoming president would traditionally want to unify the nation. Trump will be inaugurated on Friday. The back-and-forth began with the release of part of an interview for NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in which anchor Chuck Todd asked Lewis if he would try to work with Trump despite their political differences. \u201cI believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the president-elect as a legitimate president.\u201d The veteran Democrat said he believed \u201cthe Russians participated\u201d in Trump\u2019s election and added: \u201cThey helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\u201d As a result, he said, he would not attend Trump\u2019s inauguration. I don\u2019t see the president-elect as a legitimate president. \u2014 John Lewis, civil rights leader Rep.

John Lewis, D-Ga., testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington at the second day of a confirmation hearing for Attorney General-designate, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington at the second day of a confirmation hearing for Attorney General-designate, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. (Cliff Owen / Associated Press) Lewis\u00a0is\u00a0among a handful of congressional lawmakers to announce\u00a0they will not attend the inauguration, but the first to be called out by Trump.\u00a0Lewis had already emerged as a high-profile Trump opponent on Capitol Hill; on Wednesday he appeared before a Senate committee to urge that it turn aside Trump\u2019s designation of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as his attorney general. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. Trump\u2019s assessment does not match Lewis\u2019 district. It is home to Atlanta\u2019s airport and\u00a0upscale neighborhoods; it houses corporate headquarters like those of Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines. Most of the area\u2019s many colleges and universities are situated in the 5th District, where the average annual household income is $73,000. The area is at the national average for college degrees, if somewhat higher\u00a0on measures of poverty and unemployment. Trump\u2019s transition team did not immediately elaborate on the basis for Trump\u2019s statement. About 12 hours after his initial communication, Trump added another tweet: \u201cCongressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s assessment also does not reflect the views of Lewis, a nearly universally admired\u00a0figure of moral authority in a Capitol usually divided by partisanship. Even among those\u00a0who disagreed with Lewis\u2019 criticism of Trump, there was shock at the president-elect\u2019s decision to hit back at someone of his\u00a0stature. Lewis was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington, by then already a central figure in the efforts of African Americans to secure civil rights. For years, he was repeatedly arrested and beaten at Southern protests. In 1965, during the celebrated \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march at the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Ala., Lewis was clubbed so severely that he suffered a skull fracture. He recovered and led other protests, and 30 years ago he was elected to Congress. In 2011, President Obama awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. \u201cGenerations from now, when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind \u2014 an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time; whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now,\u201d Obama said as\u00a0he presented the award. In 2015, Obama joined Lewis and other civil rights veterans for a 50th anniversary walk over the bridge where Lewis was wounded. Trump\u2019s remarks were\u00a0reminiscent of his summer attack on a Gold Star family who spoke against him at the Democratic convention. In that case, as seemed to occur Saturday, Trump made assumptions based on the people he was criticizing. After Khizr Khan criticized Trump from the convention stage,\u00a0his wife standing silently by his side, Trump suggested that she had not been allowed to speak. She and her husband later said that she was too distraught to speak as the convention displayed a picture of her son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who died in a 2004 car bombing in Iraq while trying to save his fellow soldiers. Democrats on Saturday swiftly defended Lewis. \u201cJohn Lewis is an icon of the civil rights movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality,\" tweeted\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris, the California Democrat. \"He deserves better than this.\u201d New York\u2019s Charles E. Schumer, the Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate, declared that \u201cAs we honor MLK, I'll always stand by my friend, American hero @repjohnlewis . We'll lock arms & resist any effort to roll back civil rights.\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has long disagreed with the president-elect, tweeted a reproach to Trump: \u201cJohn Lewis and his \u2018talk\u2019\u00a0have changed the world.\u201d Earlier, Sasse had implored Lewis to attend the inauguration to celebrate the \u201cpeaceful transfer of power.\u201d Other\u00a0Republican elected officials were largely silent Saturday, although well-known party activists criticized Trump\u2019s decision to take on Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019s telling, I\u2019m afraid, that Donald Trump treats Vladimir Putin with more respect than he does John Lewis,\u201d tweeted Bill Kristol, the founder and editor-at-large of the Weekly Standard\u00a0and a former aide to Republican Vice President Dan Quayle. Added John Feehery, a veteran aide to Republican members of Congress: \u201cPicking a fight with John Lewis is stupid. If you don't like what he says, ignore him.\u201d Caption President Obama's farewell address President Obama delivered his farewell speech Tuesday in Chicago.

Cooper case USA Today Network Chris Ingalls, KING-TV, Seattle Published 11:53 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 | Updated 21 hours ago This is a 1973 file photo of a drawing of D. B. Cooper who became a legend when he jumped out of a Northwest Airlines Boeing 727 with $200,000 in ransom money 25-years-ago between Seattle and Portland, Ore.  Cooper hasn't been heard of since; however, some $5,880 of the loot was found along the Columbian River in 1980. (Photo: Associated Press) SEATTLE \u2014 A band of amateur scientists selected by the FBI to look for clues in the world\u2019s most infamous skyjacking may have found new evidence in the 45-year-old case. They\u2019re asking for the public\u2019s help because of potential leads that could link the hijacker known as D.B. Cooper to the Puget Sound aerospace industry in the early 1970s. The scientific team has been analyzing particles removed from the clip-on tie left behind by Cooper after he hijacked a Northwest Orient passenger jet in November 1971. A powerful electron microscope found more than 100,000 particles on old the JCPenny tie, including cerium, strontium sulfide and pure titanium. \u201cThese are what they call rare earth elements. They\u2019re used in very narrow fields, for very specific things,\u201d said Tom Kaye, lead researcher for the group that calls itself Citizen Sleuths. FBI closes D.B. Cooper hijacking case Kaye said the elements were rarely used in 1971, during the time of Cooper\u2019s daring leap with a parachute from the passenger jet. One place they were being used was for Boeing\u2019s high-tech supersonic transport plane, which was being developed with government funding in the 1960s and 1970s. Kaye wonders if Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor who wore the tie to work. \u201cThe tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these (manufacturing machines). He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,\u201d Kaye said. Kaye says Boeing was developing cutting edge monitors, like radar screens, that used some of the elements found on the tie. Kaye says the public\u2019s help is needed, particularly from old-timers with experience in the aerospace industry in the Pacific Northwest. How will 'Mad Men' end? The internet's 3 best theories The scientists would like to hear theories from the\u00a0public on what those materials could have been used for. They hope the information can help build a profile of Cooper. \u201cSomeone may be able to look at those particles and say \u2018Oh my gosh. I know what that means having those particles on the tie,\u201d Kaye said. Tipsters can reach the group through the \u201ccontact\u201d tab on the Citizen Sleuth website. On Thanksgiving Eve 1971, a man aboard a Portland to Seattle flight told the\u00a0flight attendant\u00a0he had a bomb in his suitcase. He demanded $200,000 and four parachutes, which the FBI delivered when the plane landed at Sea-Tac Airport in Seattle. When the plane was airborne again, headed south, the man who became known as D.B. Cooper jumped\u00a0from the\u00a0back staircase of the Boeing 727 with a parachute on\u00a0his back\u00a0into the frigid night sky and vanished. The FBI closed the case last year unsolved. \u00a0 617 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 158 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iuUlm3 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

By Carol Morello January 14 at 3:54 PM Follow @CMorelloWP CA MAU, Vietnam \u2014 It could have been 1969 again as Secretary of State John F. Kerry stood on the bow of the small boat chugging up the Bay Hap River on Saturday, the wind billowing his sleeves and his eyes darting left and right toward banks shrouded in dark foliage. As a young Navy lieutenant, Kerry commanded a Swift boat along this stretch of churning brown waters in the middle of a free-fire zone. Here, he earned a Silver Star for his heroics when he leapt ashore after an ambush to pursue a fleeing Viet Cong with a grenade launcher and shot him dead. Now, some 48 years later and with the rapid approach of sunset on a political career spanning almost four decades, Kerry was about to be yanked back to that time, and come face-to-face with a Viet Cong soldier who had taken part in the ambush. [ Kerry returns to Vietnam in his last trip as secretary of state ] Aides escorted Vo Ban Tam to greet Kerry on the dock, beside a row of blue tourist boats. Tam at 70 is three years younger than Kerry. He was Viet Cong in the communist stronghold of Ca Mau, one of the enemy lying in the tall grasses waiting to entrap unprotected, thin-skinned river patrol boats like Kerry\u2019s. Kerry, left, talks with Vo Ban Tam, 70, second from right, a former Viet Cong guerrilla who took part in the attack on Kerry\u2019s Swift boat on Feb. 28, 1969. (Pool photo by Alex Brandon/via Associated Press) Tam apparently had been tracked down by U.S. consulate officials and invited to meet the U.S. secretary of state he once tried to kill. Speaking through a translator, Tam said that he had known the man whom Kerry had chased and killed in the firefight of Feb. 28, 1969. His name was Ba Thanh, and he was 24 years old. \u201cHe was a good soldier,\u201d Tam told Kerry, explaining the training and skill required to handle an R-40 grenade launcher. Up until that moment, all Kerry knew was that he had shot a Viet Cong soldier. Suddenly, the soldier took shape as a man, with a name and a set of skills that he had used against Kerry and his crew. And Kerry suddenly knew his age. Tam, a successful shrimp and crab producer in Vietnam\u2019s southernmost province, had in effect exonerated Kerry from one of the more stinging attacks his opponents raised when Kerry ran for president in 2004. His war record was repeatedly denigrated by political enemies who questioned whether he deserved the Silver Star, Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts he was awarded. They charged that he did nothing particularly heroic in Ca Mau and that the Viet Cong he shot was just a teenage boy. That the Viet Cong was a man of 24, two years younger than Kerry at the time but old enough to be a credible threat, effectively negated the naysayers\u2019 narrative. A man waves as the boat with U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry aboard travels past him in the Mekong River Delta. (Pool photo by Alex Brandon/via Agence France-Presse/Getty Images) [ Critics fail to disprove Kerry\u2019s version of Vietnam War episode ] Kerry stared hard at the man in the white ball cap standing before him, the river\u2019s water reflecting off his sunglasses as he peppered Tam with questions and eagerly gobbled up details about a defining incident in his life. Tam told Kerry the Viet Cong could hear the Swift boats coming from 3,000 feet away, and he gently suggested the lumbering Americans never stood a chance. \u201cWe were guerrillas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were never where you were shooting.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re both alive,\u201d Kerry told him as they shook hands, each putting two hands into the gesture. Kerry\u2019s encounter with Tam was the emotional peak of his two-day stop in Vietnam on \u00adKerry\u2019s final trip as secretary of state. His office in Foggy Bottom is packed and ready to be shipped to Boston. It is doubtful the longtime senator from Massachusetts will ever run for public office again, but he will continue to work on climate change and \u00adenvironmental issues, and he is particularly concerned about the effect of rising sea levels and hydroelectric dams on the rivers in the lower Mekong Delta. When he wasn\u2019t looking at the \u00adriverbank for some familiar marker from long ago, he was engrossed in conversation with a local \u00adscientist who said the effect of rising salinity and dams upstream brought once-in-100-year drought last year and threatened livelihoods. Kerry says he will return to Vietnam, a country where he is treated as a returning prodigal son. Many here know Kerry and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who spent six years as a POW in Vietnam, for their work normalizing relations and helping transform enmity into friendship. Vietnamese officials regularly bestow big hugs on Kerry at the end of meetings, and civilians wait in the rain to watch him leave a restaurant. A local delegation that greeted him Saturday at the \u201cdelighted\u201d that he has returned. \u201cJohn Kerry loves Vietnam, and Vietnam loves John Kerry,\u201d said Ed Miller, a Vietnam \u00adhistorian at Dartmouth College with whom Kerry consulted about the trip. But it is sometimes difficult to tell how much of the draw of Vietnam for Kerry is in the war that ended more than 40 years ago, and how much lies in its future potential as a regional economic powerhouse. One aide described a jet-lagged Kerry arising in the middle of the night Thursday from his hotel suite in Hanoi and calling the United States to confer with one of his fellow crew members as he tried to figure out where they fought on Google Maps. But when he drove past the site where he killed Ba Thanh, about 500 yards past a bridge and a collection of houses by a mangrove where Kerry and his men picked up troops and provisions, Kerry had an air of reserve. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s, I guess, weird,\u201d he said, with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s a little surreal. But it is real.\u201d Kerry is clearly proud of his work leading to normalization and beyond, as U.S. trade with Vietnam in the past 20 years has grown from $450 million to $45\u00a0billion. [ In Vietnam, Kerry extols Asian trade pact Trump vows to scrap ] \u201cHe thinks Vietnam is a major achievement of his political \u00adcareer,\u201d said Tom Vallely, a \u00adlongtime friend from Massachusetts who was involved in raising funds to build the nonprofit \u00adFulbright University Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City. The war and the aftermath may be bookends, both in Kerry\u2019s career and as a metaphor for the United States and Vietnam \u00adthemselves. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful sense, that after all the horror we went through, we now like each other,\u201d said David Thorne, Kerry\u2019s \u00adboyhood friend, brother-in-law and adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s a small miracle that we have found a way back, to reconciliation.\u201d Read more: ",

The presence of U.S. troops on Polish soil marks a historic moment\u2014the first time Western forces are being deployed on a continuous basis to bolster NATO\u2019s eastern flank. \u201c\"We have waited for you for a very long time,\u201d the soliders heard Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz say at Saturday\u2019s event in Zagan amid falling snow. \u201cWe waited for decades, sometimes feeling we had been left alone, sometimes almost losing hope, sometimes feeling that we were the only one who protected civilization from aggression that came from the east.\u201d The event also drew hundreds of ordinary Poles.\u00a0 The American deployment includes an armored brigade of 3,500 American troops from Fort Carson, Colorado. It comes in reactions to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its backing of separatist insurgents in Ukraine's east. Those actions have frightened many in Poland, the Baltic states and other countries in Eastern Europe that were once under Moscow's control. \u201cThis is America's most capable fighting force: a combat-ready, highly trained US armoured brigade, with our most advanced equipment and weaponry,\u201d U.S. ambassador to Poland Paul James said at the ceremonies, according to an AFP report . \"This force embodies America's iron-clad commitment to honor our NATO treaty obligation to defend our NATO allies.\" The Polish government organized several other events across the country, including in downtown Warsaw, to welcome the Americans. \u201cThis is an important day for Poland, for Europe, for our common defense,\u201d Prime Minister Beata Szydlo told the U.S. soldiers. The troops are due to fan out across seven countries from Estonia to Bulgaria for exercises. A headquarters unit will be stationed in Germany. After nine months they will be replaced by another unit. NATO will also deploy four multinational battalions to its eastern flank later this year, one each to Poland and the three Baltic states. The U.S. will also lead one of those battalions. The Kremlin has denounced all these deployments, saying it considers them a threat to its own security and interests. One of the newly arrived Americans M.P Peter Gomez told AFP he felt \u201cvery welcome\u201d as he posed for selfies with Polish citizens. \u201cI'm surprised actually,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cPeople are very excited to see us.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Steele, 52, worked for MI6, Britain\u2019s overseas intelligence agency, and served in Moscow in the early 1990s. After leaving the agency, he and a partner started Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. in 2009. The firm provides strategic advice, gathers intelligence and conducts cross-border investigations, according to its website.\u00a0 Steele produced the memo containing unsubstantiated claims that Russia had compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reported . Orbis was originally hired by Fusion GPS, a Washington-based research firm working for an unknown client. Christopher Steele is seen in a photo obtained by CBS News. \u201cI know him as a very competent, professional operator who left the secret service and is now operating his own private company,\u201d Andrew Wood, Britain\u2019s ambassador to Russia from 1995 to 2000, told the BBC on Friday. \u201cI do not think he would make things up. I don\u2019t think he would, necessarily, always draw correct judgment, but that\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d In a tweet Friday, Mr.\u00a0 Trump described the \u201cphony allegations\u201d as having been compiled by his political opponents and a \u201cfailed spy afraid of being sued.\u201d He did not mention Steele by name.\u00a0 It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2017 In Moscow, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said the reported author of a dossier claiming that Russia has compromising material on Mr. Trump \u201cis not known to the Kremlin.\u201d Spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday also reiterated the Kremlin\u2019s view that the allegations are false. The dossier was reportedly produced as opposition research for the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and was being discussed in Washington as early as October, even though its details weren\u2019t widely reported until this week. The report contains unproven information on close coordination between Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle and the Russians about hacking into Democratic accounts - as well as unproven claims about unusual sexual activities by Mr. Trump attributed to anonymous sources. None of the claims have been verified. Wood said U.S. Sen. John McCain asked him about the document during a security conference in November because of Wood\u2019s relationship with Steele. After their conversation, McCain made arrangements to get a copy of the report, Wood told the BBC. Wood is now an associate fellow at the think tank Chatham House and is a consultant for companies with interests in Russia. Three British intelligence officers interviewed by The Associated Press described Steele as well regarded in the intelligence community, with excellent Russian skills and high-level sources. Although Steele wasn\u2019t a senior figure in MI6, one of the officials said because of Steele\u2019s experience on the Russia desk and the high-level contacts he had during his time in Moscow, he was brought in to help with\u00a0 the case of Alexander Litvinenko , the former Russian secret service officer and Kremlin critic who was poisoned in 2006 in London by polonium-210, a radioactive substance. The official, who worked primarily on Eastern Europe, said he had no other details of Steele\u2019s involvement in the case. James Nixey, the head of Chatham House\u2019s Russia and Eurasia program, told the AP that parts of the document created by Steele \u201cread exactly as reports from the secret services.\u201d \u201cSome of the practices which we know and which are confirmed to have happened during Soviet and post-Soviet times are reported in this dossier,\u201d Nixey said, adding that Russia\u2019s denials were also part of a Cold War pattern in which the Kremlin \u201cwould outright deny something which is quite plainly true.\u201d All three of the former intelligence officials, however, cast doubt on whether the material in the report and its level of detail would have come from active sources within Russia. The material, they said, was more likely to have come from conversations with third parties. Wood said it seems unlikely that Russian operatives intentionally lied to Steele. He added that it is not surprising that he has gone into hiding. \u201cRussia would certainly like to know where he got his information from, assuming his information is basically true and he hasn\u2019t just made it up, which I don\u2019t think for a moment,\u201d Wood said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re accustomed to take action.\u201d Still, British and Russian intelligence agents have a long history of spying on one another and setting traps. James Hudson, Britain\u2019s former deputy counsel in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, resigned in 2009 after a film emerged showing him with two women thought to be prostitutes. More recently, Britain was involved in a diplomatic flap after a former official under then-Prime Minister Tony Blair admitted that British authorities had rigged up a fake rock in Moscow to spy on Russians. Nixey said Moscow is unlikely to have changed its habits \u201cfor the simple reason that the Russians believe they are at war with the West.\u201d Anyone, he said, with a \u201cconsiderable degree of involvement with Russia, goes there frequently on business, is going to be looked at, to a greater or lesser extent.\u201d Russians have even coined a word for this type of compromising material: kompromat .\u00a0 ",

A week of powerful storms has significantly eased the state\u2019s water shortage, pulling nearly all of Northern California out of drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The \u00a0report underscores what... (Joseph Serna, Matt Stevens) But he notes that warm winter storms also bring benefits. Decades of irrigation in the Central Valley had leached out all manner of salts and heavy metals and pesticides from the soil, and those leachates flow out with the farm runoff to pollute the Sacramento Delta, a vital breeding area for fish. \u201cNow we got a huge volume of water coming down the Sacramento and San Joaquin, flushing the Delta out, cleaning out those fish estuaries.\u201d By Wednesday, the snow level lowered in the mountains. The flakes fell heavy, not as dry Utah powder, but a wet slurry dubbed \u201cSierra Cement\u201d by skiers. Avalanche danger closed ski resorts in Lake Tahoe\u00a0and sections of the roads getting there from the valley. But big concerns of a ravaged snowpack diminished. Down at Chili Bar, the mood was giddy.\u00a0With a whole lot of rain hitting the lower and midslopes, the South Fork was heaving at about 150,000 gallons per second.\u00a0A fun springtime trip for kayakers would run on less than a sixth of that rate. Soberanes put on a thermal shirt, then a fleece jacket, and sealed himself into a drysuit. He kissed his wife Fernanda, and his 10-month-old daughter, Alondra, and paddled upstream through some trees in an eddy. Fernanda got in the their old red Ford F150 and headed down Highway 49 to his takeout spot. Soberanes knew the biggest danger was getting stuck in one of those tree thickets \u2014 \u201cstrainers\u201d in river-runner parlance \u2014 because they catch you like a colander while the fast current pulls you under. He moved into the 45-degree water and was soon in a section of colliding, oncoming waves that thrashed him from all directions. Cold whitewater smashed his face every other second. He launched over massive tepees of brown water and torn up weeds, and then hit several beautiful nonbreaking waves at a rapid called Meat Grinder, one as high as 15 feet. At this rate, he\u2019d finish an 8-mile run that normally took an hour and a half in about 25 minutes. Brian Kallen, a rafting guide\u00a0going down the fork with friends, kept his eye on a 10-foot log floating down next to them for the first 15 minutes. If they got stuck in the trough of a stationary wave, that heavy beast could do a lot of damage, \u201cbreaching like a whale on your boat.\u201d Those deep stationary waves flipped many a\u00a0boat, launching rafters into the roiling current without a chance to fill their lungs, then \u2014\u00a0eventually \u2014\u00a0popping them to the surface to dodge\u00a0deadly strainers and hope they could scramble to shore before the onset of hypothermia. The river Kallen knew had totally changed. Giant boulders he once passed by were now underwater and creating drops and waves he had never seen. Soberanes moved more nimbly in his kayak, so he liked to flirt with such dangers. Soon he was racing down a fast bumpy section, slaloming between trees, hooting along the way, like a powder skier  billowing through the aspen. He crossed under the old Coloma Bridge, then a rock monument \u2014 a good 10\u00a0feet into the river today \u2014 marking the very spot John Marshall discovered gold. The sun shone for the first time in days. At the takeout, Fernanda, 30, sat on a blanket under some mossy oaks, cooing to her baby. The sun lit up big drops hanging from the tips of tree twigs like chandelier crystals. It suddenly felt like a picnic day in the English countryside. She pointed to Soberanes as he rounded the bend. \u201cPapa viene,\u201d she said. Daddy\u2019s coming. He pulled into a little eddy, still amped up on endorphins of the run, and pondered going to the next spot down the river. \u201cNah, I got to get to work,\u201d he ultimately decided. His day job is a tree-trimmer. He\u2019d swap his kayak for his chain saw. The wind had left him plenty of work.

John Lewis Donovan Slack , USA TODAY Published 3:29 p.m. ET Jan. 14, 2017 | Updated 31 minutes ago 268 Shares Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., speaks after being presented with the Liberty Medal for his dedication to civil rights during a ceremony at the National Constitution Center, on Sept. 19, 2016, in Philadelphia. \u00a0(Photo: Matt Slocum, AP) It\u2019s almost as if they were surprised. President-elect Donald Trump sparked outrage (again) Saturday by attacking Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., after the civil rights icon said he would skip Trump\u2019s inauguration and doesn\u2019t consider his election legitimate. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAll talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\u201d Trump blasts Rep. Lewis for saying his election not legitimate The reaction, as one would imagine, was swift. Democrats, celebrities\u00a0and even some Republicans weighed in. \u201cJohn Lewis and his \u2018talk\u2019 have changed the world,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse, R.-Neb., tweeted with a link to a photo of Lewis in 1965, when he was badly beaten at the Selma bridge in a voting rights march. Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kan., said he disagrees with Lewis\u2019s questioning of the presidential election, but said he is a \u201chero & icon.\u201d \u201cHe deserves all of our respect,\u201d Yoder tweeted . \u201cHe's earned it.\u201d NAACP President Cornell Brooks demanded that Trump apologize and said that by disrespecting Lewis, Trump had \"dishonored Lewis' sacrifice & demeaned the Americans & rights, he nearly died 4.\" By disrespecting @repjohnlewis , @realDonaldTrump dishonored Lewis' sacrifice & demeaned the Americans & rights, he nearly died 4. Apologize. pic.twitter.com/NM3G3X2o54 \u2014 Cornell Wm. Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) January 14, 2017 Former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele had some concise advice for Trump. \u201cNumber one, don\u2019t tweet that. Number two, don\u2019t go there,\u201d he said on MSNBC, adding that the attacks were \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cunfortunate.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., expressed support for Lewis, a \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201cAmerican hero,\u201d and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi\u00a0noted that many people have tried to silence Lewis over the years. \u201cAll have failed,\u201d she tweeted. As we honor MLK, I'll always stand by my friend, American hero @repjohnlewis . We'll lock arms & resist any effort to roll back civil rights. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) January 14, 2017 Ahead of #MLKday2017 , let us remember that many have tried to silence @repjohnlewis over the years. All have failed. \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) January 14, 2017 Newly elected Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also weighed in. \u201cJohn Lewis is an icon of the Civil Rights Movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality,\u201d she wrote . \u201cHe deserves better than this.\u201d That was mild compared to some of the reactions on Twitter. John Lewis is the conscience of America. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have the moral stature to kiss John Lewis\u2019s feet. \u2014 Robert Reich (@RBReich) January 14, 2017 Trump attacked disabled, gold star family, baby & John Lewis, but not Putin hacking our election. He has no moral or patriotic standing. \u2014 Sarah Reese Jones (@PoliticusSarah) January 14, 2017 Donald \"bone spurs\" Trump could use some lessons in courage and action from John Lewis. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) January 14, 2017 Trump is, in fact, not fit to be a citizen of John Lewis's country https://t.co/BFpSU1grW9 \u2014 Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) January 14, 2017 Leave it to Trump to kick off MLK weekend by attacking civil rights icon John Lewis, reminding us what the 'orange' face of hate looks like. \u2014 Bill Madden (@activist360) January 14, 2017 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ixdbsG Most Popular ",

As President Obama gave his farewell address to the nation on Tuesday night, he also began the shift to a third stage of his political career. The once young, idealistic senator-turned-two-term-president will soon become an influential strategist and ally to those worried about the future with Donald Trump at the helm of the most powerful nation on the planet. Obama nodded to this new role in his speech Tuesday. He did not directly criticize his successor, but used lines like \"I reject discrimination against Muslim-Americans\" that were clearly aimed at Trump and delighted the audience of more than 20,000 Democrats who crowded into McCormick Place to hear his final address as president. Play Obama At Farewell Address: You Made Me a Better President 0:40 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170114221055if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/852094531759\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> His path forward is still evolving. Prior to November's election, Obama and his aides had hinted that the outgoing president would limit his future involvement in politics and instead focus on writing a book chronicling his eight years in office, use his foundation to expand his \"My Brother's Keeper\" program and give speeches and join boards, as other ex-presidents have done. But now, Obama's chief achievements, such as his climate change policies and the Affordable Care Act, are in danger of being gutted by the Republican Congress, the Democratic Party is in disarray and much of the country \u2014 and the world \u2014 is uncertain what a Trump presidency will bring. So Obama is beginning to telegraph a post-presidency different from George W. Bush, who largely receded from politics altogether after his eight years in office. Obama has said that he will press the Democratic Party to organize more effectively, from fielding strong candidates in school board and state legislative elections across the country to making sure the party's candidates campaign in more conservative areas. Related: President Obama Caps Long Goodbye With Farewell Speech \"I think that if Hillary Clinton had won the election, then I'd just turn over the keys,\" Obama told the New Yorker recently. \"We'd make sure the briefing books were in order and out we go. I think now I have some responsibility to at least offer my counsel to those who will continue to be elected officials about how the DNC can help rebuild, how state parties and progressive organizations can work together.\" US President Barack Obama arrives to speak during his farewell address in Chicago, Illinois on January 10, 2017.                 Barack Obama closes the book on his presidency, with a farewell speech in Chicago that will try to lift supporters shaken by Donald Trump's shock election. / AFP PHOTO / Joshua LOTTJOSHUA LOTT/AFP/Getty Images JOSHUA LOTT / AFP - Getty Images The outgoing president, who will leave office at just 55 years old and in good health, has also promised that if Trump steps over certain lines, he will not be silent. \"I think it's important to give the incoming administration space,\" he told Comedy Central's Trevor Noah last month. But he added, \"There may be occasions where, even in the first year, if I think core values of ours are being threatened. I mean, I've said this, if I thought a Muslim registry was being set up that violates the Constitution and violates who we are and would make us less safe because it'd make it easier for groups like ISIL to recruit and radicalize homegrown terrorists, I might have to say something about that. \"If I saw Dream Act kids \u2014 young people who were brought here as children who are for all intents and purposes Americans \u2014 suddenly being rounded up, contrary to who we are as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, I might have to say something about.\" Some of the president's allies are also preparing for major roles in defending Obama's legacy. The president's close friend and former Attorney General Eric Holder is now representing the State of California as an attorney, looking to defend that state's liberal, Obama-style policies if they come into conflict with Trump's goals. A group of elected officials in blue states, including former Obama chief of staff and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, have promised to oppose Trump if he seeks the mass deportation of undocumented people that he proposed during his campaign. And young Democrats who worked as field organizers on Obama's campaigns and lower-level aides in the White House are now exploring their own campaigns for state legislatures and other local offices.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story In 2008 and 2012, I voted for Obama, I was pro-gay marriage, Planned Parenthood was very important to me. But after eight years, I saw there was much more racial divide than there had ever been, I didn\u2019t like the way the economy is going and I didn\u2019t like the stance he took on police. My husband is a court officer and volunteers in the police force. [ President Obama ] didn\u2019t support law enforcement the way he did the community that felt they were being unjustly treated. I think he could have done a better job instead of pointing blame. Instead of saying we need to educate people on how to behave when they\u2019re being pulled over by the police. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I\u2019m seeing a barrage of patients coming in from different countries. An Iraqi immigrant came in last night, he needs dialysis. He will never be productive in the U.S., he will always be dependent on Medicaid . I feel for him, I want to help him, but we have to take care of our own people first. Driving to work yesterday, I saw three homeless people. They need our help. If I turned down every candidate who objectified women, I\u2019d vote for no one. _____ A \u2018Good Man, Deep Down\u2019 Voter: Sandy Pearson, 48. Studying to be a mortgage broker. Home: Chattanooga, Tenn. Trump\u2019s not a perfect man, by any means. He kind of reminds me of my ex-husband. I think he\u2019s a really good man, deep down. This guy has such potential, and I truly believe he cares about our country and wants to help everyone. I do read things on occasion that he tweets and I think, oh my word. I wish I could have had 10 minutes with him. Listen, Donald, you need to straighten up and stop with this foolishness. What he said about women was disrespectful . But I don\u2019t get offended like some people do. You get through the bad and you focus on the good. Basically these were our choices, and I felt he was the better choice, and I had to overlook the negatives and focus on the positives. At the very beginning of this election, I was leaning toward Bernie Sanders. I looked at all the candidates, what were their ideas to help our country out of debt and make our military strong and be there for our vets. I have so many friends whose health care costs have doubled and are having to get extra jobs just to pay their insurance. And I read all these things about people where their religious liberties are not being taken seriously. _____ \u2018He Knows How to Build Things\u2019 Voter: Deb Alighire, 44. Engineer and program manager at Mopar, a subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Home: Clarkston, Mich. I\u2019m very focused on bringing the plants back. In metro Detroit, waiters usually were younger people and during the time of hardship, the bankruptcies, it was very striking to me to go to a Papa Gino\u2019s and have a middle-aged man being a waiter. Usually these people would have some kind of job related to the automotive industry. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I\u2019m super excited about Trump. I believe he knows how to build things. My dad worked at a coal power plant for 39 years and they\u2019re freaked out about energy changing too quickly. I\u2019m also concerned about immigration. I went to Minnesota and I had a Somali cabdriver who lectured me for 35 minutes to the airport about how women in America have too much freedom. My thought process on that is that I don\u2019t like seeing people going through the hardship they go through, but I don\u2019t want to go backwards in the feminist movement, either. _____ Taylor Davis Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times Daughter of Engineers Voter: Taylor Davis, 27. Works in a small business. Home: Enfield, Conn. I helped campaign for Obama and I was a die-hard Bernie supporter. When he backed Hillary Clinton, I couldn\u2019t get behind it . Both my parents are engineers. My mom was an engineer long before many women in the field. When the economy started faltering, she went from a very high position at Pratt & Whitney to being unemployed for a year, and that was heartbreaking. I think that Trump really cares about having high-skilled jobs back here, not necessarily the service industry. Do I think Trump\u2019s trying to send women back to the kitchen? No, his daughter is a great example . She ran the women-who-work campaign long before he ran for president. _____ Didn\u2019t Like Him, Until a Rally Voter: Robin Mueller, 42. Preschool teacher. Home: Sterling Heights, Mich. I made up my mind for Trump at the last minute. Since my husband is in the military, I was concerned about having someone who didn\u2019t have military experience, didn\u2019t have the knowledge of dealing with world leaders. And I kind of thought he had a big mouth. But I had an 8-year-old who was totally on the Trump train. He talked me into taking him to a Trump rally. I expected him to be like what I\u2019d seen on the news, saying hateful things. But his presence was very calming and I liked his talking points. We really are the middle class, and we kind of get swept aside. The first time she ran against Obama, I was all on board for Hillary Clinton. I really wanted to have a female president. I think that\u2019s important. But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s her. In the past, her stance on abortion was more the way I feel, just for the first trimester, then she did a 360. She was here in the primary, having a debate with Bernie Sanders. He answered the question honestly. When they asked her the same question, she kind of danced around it. Then she went on \u201cThe View\u201d and said she was for late-term abortions. Just take a stance, be honest. Same thing as with gay marriage, she wasn\u2019t for it, then she was. I\u2019m 100 percent for it. It\u2019s ridiculous the way we tell people who they can and cannot marry. Don\u2019t go back and forth. Don\u2019t pander. Advertisement I voted for Obama the last time. I don\u2019t agree with a lot of what he said, but I felt he was honest. _____ A Racist? \u2018You Don\u2019t Know Me\u2019 Voter: Katie Holder, 39. Owns a weight-loss business. Home: Gulf Shores, Ala. I feel very, very badly for the people who are very scared for their way of life. From what I\u2019m understanding, he\u2019s only really wanting illegal immigrants that have committed crimes to be deported, which I agree with. I feel bad for the lesbian and gay and transsexual community that fear for their way of life. From what I understand, he says he\u2019s not going to mess with that. Somebody called me a racist because I did vote for Trump. Hold on, you don\u2019t know me. Doesn\u2019t that make you a racist by calling me a racist when you don\u2019t know me? I\u2019m looking for a brighter future for me and my children, and honestly I felt l like our country was kind of at risk if we did elect Hillary. _____ Victoria Czapski Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times No Time for Political Correctness Voter: Victoria Czapski, 45. Works in education. Home: Sterling Heights, Mich. I felt he had what it would take to get the country back on track. Being P.C. was going to kill the country. He speaks his mind and because of that, he\u2019s not going to lie to you. I don\u2019t want immigrants, accepting them without doing the background checks. Are these people terrorists ? I don\u2019t want to live in a country where we have to worry about going to the movie theater or the mall. Let\u2019s be on the offensive, versus the defensive. We are a country based on immigrants. But I believe they should go through the process. My great-grandparents came here, they had to learn English. This is a Christian country. The whole bending over backwards. He says what everyone\u2019s thinking and is afraid to say. That doesn\u2019t make anyone bigoted. I\u2019m not saying there are people out there who shouldn\u2019t be helped. I worked in the inner cities. They\u2019re on welfare. They make a certain amount of money and everything gets taken away. That amount of money is so low that they have no incentive to work. Why don\u2019t you allow them to gradually earn more money? Find a way to help people get over the hump. _____ Can\u2019t Put Him in a Box Voter: Pam Cornett, 46. Formerly self-employed, now working in customer service. Home: Chattanooga, Tenn. I voted for Trump because I wanted change. I feel like our economy has totally tanked. People do not have disposable income. I feel the last eight years have been a joke. Obama was out for himself. I don\u2019t think he really respected the office. I think it was more about him being a celebrity than a president. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Trump\u2019s a successful businessman, and I feel like that\u2019s what America needs to bring our economy back. I don\u2019t think Donald Trump is really Republican, to be quite honest with you. He\u2019s not in a box. One of the most attractive things to me is he can\u2019t be boxed. He wants to bring America back to what it was before. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s taking us back to women have no rights or slavery days. _____ Paula Filar Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times He Was Egregious, but She Lied Voter: Paula Filar, 71. Retired business owner. Home: Shelby Township, Mich. I thought if he would only have kept his mouth shut during the primary. About the way people looked, about their size. Really? About McCain. I mean, really? All of it was so egregious. I hated it, I cringed. All of that was bad, but it didn\u2019t stop me. And it\u2019s like Hillary has the right to talk about Trump when she stayed with a guy who was in the White House and took advantage of a young intern? Why would you stay with him? Benghazi. The emails . The I.R.S. She\u2019s a liar. The Clintons got wealthy because of their position. I\u2019d rather have someone there who doesn\u2019t need the money. He\u2019s got a message. He\u2019s going to make a change. Her message was all him. All negative ads. I spent a long time in the staffing industry here, worked with the automotive industry. We weren\u2019t competitive. That\u2019s got to be turned around. We have to have incentives for companies to keep their work here. _____ Voter: Tangie Wooden, 44. Learning facilitator for Blue Cross of Tennessee. Home: Ringgold, Ga. When Trump became my only choice, I felt he was the lesser of two evils. I had major issues with Hillary as far as ethics was concerned. It seems she feels that she is above the law and nothing ever seems to stick. I didn\u2019t particularly like everything he was saying as far as building a wall, and doing this to immigrants. I looked at that more as bravado, his audience needed that to get the applause. But there are allegations about killing people who get in her way \u2014 Vince Foster, people like that. Someone who has a big bravado is not as concerning to me as someone who might kill people who get in her way. _____ Voter: Kasia Riddle, 43. Substitute teacher. Home: Murfreesboro, Tenn. I run my household like a business, my classroom like a business. I expect him to run the country in such a manner. You don\u2019t pay more money out than you have. You want to have your budget under control. You want to know the people you\u2019re working with are above average. You want to pick the people based on what they can do, not on what they did for you. He\u2019s not getting large amounts from donors based on what you\u2019ll do for me later. _____ Guzin Karides Credit Julia Rendleman for The New York Times A Voice for Women Voter: Guzin Karides, 49. Homemaker, former attorney. Home: Virginia Beach I laughed Trump off like everyone else did. Once I stopped laughing at him and started listening, I started to support him. I felt like once you got past the bluster, he really was interested in helping everyone. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I do think having a secure border is very important. My father was a Muslim immigrant from Turkey, he went through the process. I don\u2019t agree with a ban on Muslims, but my father was very wary of Muslims who came over if they didn\u2019t have a reason to be here. He would support a full vetting, but not a total ban. I have always considered myself a feminist. For me, I want to be treated the exact same way. That\u2019s not the feel I get from feminists today, they want extra privileges. I gave up my first marriage so I could be a law partner and then I had to give up on my partnership so I could be a better mom. To say women are going backwards would be wrong. Look at how much Trump hires women, how much he does rely on women, how much he relies on his own daughter. I\u2019m sort of amazed by her. She may pull him more into the middle. She\u2019ll be a good voice for women.

(Handout photo by Jamie Holladay-Collins/LAVC) Nick AndersonThe Washington Post The cyberattack struck Los Angeles Valley College late last month, disrupting email, voice mail and computer systems at the public community college in Southern California. Then, school officials found a ransom note. The missive advised the college that its electronic files had been encrypted and that the files could only be unlocked with a \"private key.\" The attackers would supply the key after receiving payment in the valuable digital currency known as bitcoin , which can be used anonymously without a centralized bank. \"You have just 7 days to send us the BitCoin after 7 days we will remove your private keys and it's impossible to recover your files,\" the attackers warned, according to a copy of the note obtained by The Washington Post. Leaders of the Los Angeles Community College District decided to pay the ransom. \"In consultation with district and college leadership, outside cybersecurity experts and law enforcement, a payment of $28,000 was made by the District,\" Francisco C. Rodriguez, the district's chancellor, said in a statement on Jan. 6. \"It was the assessment of our outside cybersecurity experts that making a payment would offer an extremely high probability of restoring access to the affected systems, while failure to pay would virtually guarantee that data would be lost.\" District officials report that the payment yielded the desired information. Email and other information systems were back in working order as Los Angeles authorities investigated what officials believe was a randomly targeted attack. As of Thursday evening, IT experts were still working to unlock some of the college's files. Ransom note Excerpt from a ransom note. Excerpt from a ransom note. (The Washington Post) Classes were proceeding normally, on campus and online, officials said. Students returned from winter break on Jan. 3, as scheduled, days after the attack was detected on Dec. 30. The incident at the 19,000-student community college provides another cautionary tale of the vulnerability of higher education to malicious hackers. Like businesses, colleges and universities are in a continual quest to stay a step ahead of attackers who threaten in numerous ways to breach or disrupt critical databases and networks. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse counts 19 educational institutions that disclosed data-security breaches in 2016, including hacking episodes at the University of Virginia , the University of Central Florida, the University of Connecticut and Michigan State University .

(St. Xavier High School) A man who dropped out of high school to fight in World War II earned his high school diploma Friday at age 90, according to a report Saturday. Lou Schipper persuaded his mother to let him enlist before he graduated and never looked back, the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. He became a Navy Seabee in the Pacific. The graduation ceremony was held at a senior living residence in Cincinnati with Tony Schad, a representative from St. Xavier. Schad choked with emotion as he presented Schipper with his diploma. Expand / Contract (St. Xavier High School) \"Mr. Louis Schipper, on behalf of your classmates from St. Xavier High School class of 1946, the faculty, staff and administration, I'm happy to officially welcome you to the long blue line, St. X,\" Schad said, the paper reported. The school heard about Schipper from one of his old classmates, George Wood. \"He was the only freshman in the class who was interviewed with callouses on his hands because that farm boy knew how to do a day\u2019s work,\" Wood told the paper. Dottie Schipper said her husband was reluctant at first to become a high school graduate. \"He said,\u00a0'What the hell do I need with a diploma? I'm 90 years old. Do you want me to get a resume and go to work now?'\" she told the paper. \"He didn't act like he was really excited, but he was really excited.\" The Navy discharged Schipper after the war and he became an electrician. He worked until he was nearly 60. Schad told the Enquirer that Schipper represents all the best things about St. X. \u201cI really appreciate it,\u201d Schipper said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d make it.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "3 Cleveland Police Officers Facing Administrative Charges in Tamir Rice Case By JULIA JACOBO Jan 13, 2017, 9:31 PM ET 0 Shares Tamir Rice is seen in this undated photo provided by his family. 0 Shares Email Three Cleveland police officers are facing administrative charges following an internal investigation into the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice , who was shot and killed by police while carrying a toy gun in November 2014. The charges were brought against Cleveland police officers Timothy Loehmann, Frank Garmback and William Cunningham, who were all on the scene when Rice was shot, city officials said in a press conference Friday afternoon. The city's Quality Control Office, Integrity Control Section and Critical Incident Review Committee reviewed the case and recommended administrative charges, the mayor's office said in a press release. In December 2015, Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson announced that the review would be conducted, saying, \"People are upset, and legitimately and rightfully so.\" Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams reviewed the findings of the report and referred them to the Department of Public Safety for a final determination on the appropriate disciplinary action. DPS Director Michael McGrath will hold disciplinary hearings for the three officers, who face discipline ranging from 11 days suspension to termination, according to the mayor's office. The DPS Quality Control Office also conducted an investigation into the hiring of Loehmann, specifically his application documents, the mayor's office said. Administrative charges against a fourth officer are expected, according to the mayor's office. Police Violence May Be Reduced More by Reforms Than Technology, Advocates Say In November 2014, Loehmann shot Rice as he was holding a toy gun at a Cleveland playground. The boy's sister ran to the gazebo where he was shot in a state of panic, and Cunningham and Garmback restrained her before handcuffing her and placing her in the back of the patrol car, according to a report by the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office. \"It was Officer Cunningham\u2019s idea to place her in the back of the car since she would not calm down,\" the report from the prosecutor's office stated. An Ohio grand jury declined to indict Loehmann or his partner, Garmback, in the boy's death. The prosecutor at the time, Timothy McGinty, who recommended no charges be filed, said Loehmann \"had reason to fear for his life\" and that it was \"indisputable\" from video evidence that Rice was reaching for the gun, though he called the shooting a \"tragedy.\" The City of Cleveland settled a $6 million wrongful death suit by the boy's family in the case, although there was no admission of wrongdoing. After the shooting, Loehmann and Garmback had been placed on restricted duties, which is a paid administrative position, the president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association told ABC News in 2015. The CPPA said it was \"encouraged\" that Loehmann \"has not been charged with any wrongdoing\" in Rice's shooting and emphasized that he \"did nothing wrong that day.\" \"There is no question, and there has never been, that the death of Tamir Rice was tragic,\" the police union said. \"Nevertheless, all agree that Officer Loehmann was not wrong in reacting the way he did. It appears that the actual charges are created to discipline him, and perhaps discharge him, despite the fact that he did nothing wrong that day.\" The CPPA also called the administrative action against Garmback \"disappointing.\" It is not clear whether Cunningham was placed on restricted duties after the shooting. The Critical Incident Review Committee was created in February 2016 to \"conduct a thorough review administrative review of the actions of all employees and officers involved\" in the incident, according to a press release from the city of Cleveland. It consists of members of the Cleveland Division of Police Command Staff, Integrity Control Section and Training Section, along with members of the City of Cleveland Law Department. ABC News' Benjamin Stein and Michael Kreisel contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

John Lewis, D-Ga., poses for a photograph under a quote of his that is displayed in the Civil Rights Room in the Nashville Public Library on\u00a0Nov. 18, 2016. (Mark Humphrey / AP) Cathleen DeckerLos Angeles Times In yet another indication of his unwillingness to let criticism pass, Donald Trump has lashed out as \u201call talk\u2026no action\u201d national icon John Lewis , who was repeatedly beaten and nearly lost his life in the long struggle for civil rights. Trump\u2019s Twitter comments early Saturday about the Georgia congressman followed Lewis\u2019s assertion Friday that he did not see Trump as a \u201clegitimate\u201d president because of Russian involvement in the defeat of his opponent, Hillary Clinton . The president-elect\u2019s response was rife with irony: Trump did so at the beginning of a weekend dedicated to civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., over something Trump himself has done repeatedly. Trump built his political name on a more than five-year effort to de-legitimize President Obama by falsely claiming that he was foreign born. Trump also used racially freighted language when he said that Lewis\u2019 Atlanta district was \u201ccrime infested\u201d and \u201cfalling apart.\u201d It actually includes much of the area\u2019s most successful neighborhoods. The furor began on Friday with the release of part of an interview for NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in which anchor Chuck Todd asked Lewis if he would try to work with Trump despite their political differences. \u201cI believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the president-elect as a legitimate president.\u201d He said he believed \u201cthe Russians participated\u201d in Trump\u2019s election and added: \u201cThey helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\u201d As a result, he said, he would not attend Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday. He is one of a handful of members of Congress to announce that he will not attend the inauguration, but the first to be called out by Trump. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. Lewis was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington, by that time already a central figure in the efforts of African-Americans to secure civil rights. For years, he was repeatedly arrested and beaten in southern protests. John Lewis Marion Trikosko photo, John Lewis speaks at a meeting of American Society of Newspaper Editors at the Statler Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., April 16, 1964.

(MPI, Getty Images) In 1965, during the celebrated \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march at the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama, Lewis was clubbed so severely that he suffered a skull fracture. He recovered and led other protests, and 30 years ago was elected to Congress. In 2011, President Obama awarded Lewis the presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. \u201cGenerations from now, when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind -- an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time; whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now,\u201d Obama said. In 2015, Obama joined Lewis and other civil rights veterans for a 50th anniversary walk over the bridge at which Lewis was wounded. Trump\u2019s remarks, reminiscent of his summer attack on a Gold Star family who spoke against him at the Democratic convention, spurred defenses of Lewis by political figures and others. \u201cJohn Lewis is an icon of the civil rights movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality,\" said Sen. Kamala Harris, the California Democrat. \"He deserves better than this.\u201d ",

By Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis January 14 at 6:52 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @brady_dennis In the past week, the Obama administration overturned a decades\u00ad-old policy toward Cuban immigrants, forged two major agreements to address racial bias in big-city police departments and approved an unexpected cut in mortgage rates for hundreds of thousands of low-income and first-time home buyers. Officials even made time, after years of lobbying, to add the rusty patched bumble bee to the list of endangered species. In the final days before President Obama leaves office, administration officials are rushing to complete dozens of tasks that will affect millions of lives and solidify the president\u2019s imprint on history. But in many cases, their permanence is uncertain, and President-elect Donald Trump is already pledging to undo some of them after taking office. \u201cHe is clearly using executive power aggressively and trying to do as much as possible in his final days,\u201d Princeton University history and public affairs professor Julian Zelizer said in an email. \u201cIt is clear that a president who was once reluctant to use the power of his own office has changed his heart, especially now that he sees a radically conservative Congress and Republican president-elect are getting ready to dismantle much of what he has done.\u201d On Thursday alone, the administration designated three new national monuments and expanded another two in sites ranging from a forest in the Pacific Northwest to a school for freed slaves in South Carolina; took away one of the special immigration privileges Cubans arriving in the United States without visas have enjoyed for 50 years; announced sanctions designations against 18 senior Syrian officials for their role in the use of chlorine as a chemical weapon in 2014 and 2015; awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Vice President Biden; and accused Fiat Chrysler of cheating on national emission standards for some of its diesel trucks. (The Washington Post) [ Obama beats FDR, creating and expanding most national monuments ever ] For weeks, congressional Republicans and members of the Trump transition team have questioned why the White House is pressing ahead given that the GOP will control both the executive and legislative branch for at least the next two years. On Dec. 5, 23 GOP senators wrote Obama a letter asking that his administration \u201ccease issuing new, nonemergency rules and regulations given the recent election results of November 8.\u201d \u201cIt is our job now to determine the right balance between regulation and free market principles and make sure that our federal government no longer stands between Americans and financial success,\u201d they wrote. Many departments have also accelerated hiring in recent weeks , hoping to bring on as many employees as possible in case Trump proceeds with a planned freeze for federal employees. On Tuesday, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) wrote the heads of 18 agencies , asking them to provide details on their current hiring practices. Both Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have vowed to reverse some of Obama\u2019s key policies as soon as they take office. But it will be nearly impossible to erase all of them in the months and years ahead, and to achieve the maximum impact, Trump will have to accept new limits on his own power. The Obama administration\u2019s race toward the finish line isn\u2019t completely out of the ordinary. Last-minute regulatory actions also spiked in 2008 and in 2000, said Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at the conservative American Action Forum, which has long been tracking White House regulations. But since Oct. 1, Obama has finalized more economically significant rules \u2014 ones with an estimated economic impact of at least $100 million \u2014 than Bill Clinton did in his final four months in office, according to Daniel P\u00e9rez, a policy analyst at the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University. \u201cWe find routinely that politics influences things, and this is just a manifestation of it,\u201d Batkins said. \u201cWe see how politics can bend these levers of policy.\u201d More broadly, Obama has finalized at least 571 major rules while in office, nearly 63 percent more than George W. Bush did during his two terms. And half of the major rules the White House Office of Management and Budget reviewed during the first five-and-a-half years of the administration had an economic impact of at least $1 billion, P\u00e9rez said. [ Obama to top aides: \u2018What are we doing on bees?\u2019\u2019 ] The tempo of federal regulation can work both ways, Batkins noted. While the Obama administration has been feverishly publishing new regulations in the wake of November\u2019s election, the same White House wasn\u2019t so eager to produce new regulations in the run-up to Obama\u2019s reelection in 2012. That October, by Batkins\u2019s count, just four rules came out of the White House. The president and his aides have been unapologetic about the burst of new policies in recent weeks. \u201cThe administration has made a concerted effort to complete important work that was started months or even years ago,\u201d said White House spokesman Patrick Rodenbush in an email, adding that when it comes to its most recent rules, \u201cwe have followed the same rigorous practices and principles used to develop and review regulations that have been upheld throughout the entirety of this administration and previous administrations.\u201d Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who did not brief members of Trump\u2019s transition team before announcing Monday that the Federal Housing Authority would cut interest rates, told reporters that he had \u201cno reason to believe this will be scaled back,\u201d adding that the change\u201coffers a good benefit to hard-working American families out there at a time when interest rates might well continue to go up.\u201d But Ben Carson, whom Trump nominated to succeed Castro, told lawmakers Thursday he was \u201csurprised to see something of this nature being done on the way out the door, which of course has a profound effect.\u201d \u201cCertainly, if confirmed I\u2019m going to work with the FHA administrator and other experts to examine that policy,\u201d Carson said. The White House\u2019s sense of urgency is probably well founded, given Trump\u2019s commitment to try to roll back the policies of the Obama era. And Obama took much the same approach after assuming office in 2009, essentially halting former president George W. Bush\u2019s pending regulations. In a letter on Jan. 20, 2009, then-White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel wrote to the heads of every federal agency, ordering them to halt any regulations that had yet to be published in the Federal Register and to consider a 60-day extension of the effective date of regulations that had not yet taken effect. \u201cIt is important that President Obama\u2019s appointees and designees have the opportunity to approve and review any new or pending regulations,\u201d Emanuel wrote at the time. Such an approach today would effectively freeze an array of Obama policies, including five new Energy Department efficiency standards issued Dec. 28 affecting portable air conditioners, swimming pool pumps, walk-in coolers and freezers, commercial boilers and uninterruptible power supplies. The agency estimates the standards will save U.S. consumers between $15 billion and $35 billion over time, but only one of them is published in the Federal Register so far. Congressional Republicans are hoping to go further, having passed legislation Jan. 4 that would allow lawmakers to overturn any rule finalized in the last 60 legislative days of Obama\u2019s tenure in a single vote, rather than taking them up individually. The White House has pledged to veto the bill, called the Midnight Rule Relief Act, but given that the Senate is not slated to take it up until after Inauguration Day, it could ultimately come to Trump\u2019s desk for his signature. Still, it is unclear whether the new president will sign it. P\u00e9rez noted that the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which is what allows Congress to reverse a rule within 60 legislative days of its enactment, prohibits agencies from issuing a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d rule once it is overturned. \u201cThe Trump administration may very well have different policy preferences for any given area of regulation,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cbut disapproval via the [Congressional Review Act] would limit the Executive\u2019s power to implement its own regulatory agenda for any given issue-area.\u201d On Friday, the Obama administration showed no signs of slowing down. It filed a defense brief in a lawsuit brought by states over regulation of the nation\u2019s rivers and streams, defied industry opposition by publishing a rule intended to keep first responders safer after a deadly 2013 fertilizer facility explosion in Texas, took steps to lift decades-old financial sanctions against Sudan and finalized regulations aimed at cracking down on the inhumane treatment of show horses. But even as Obama was churning out his final actions, Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill were taking a first step toward repealing the president\u2019s signature health care law, starting to erase his legacy even before his time in office ends. national ",
