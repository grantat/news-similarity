    "text": "Obama Lines up a Meeting With Lawmakers, a Speech in Chicago By josh lederman, associated press HONOLULU \u0097 Dec 31, 2016, 7:30 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press In this photo taken Dec. 16, 2016, President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. President Barack Obama will strategize next week with Democratic lawmakers about how to prevent Republicans from destroying his Affordable Care Act. He'll also give a speech in Chicago on Jan. 10, 2017, that is expected to be his closing message as president. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) 0 Shares Email Eager to stop Republicans from destroying his signature health care law , President Barack Obama and Democratic lawmakers will meet next week to try to forge a common strategy. Obama also plans a major valedictory speech in Chicago, his hometown, shortly before his presidency ends. Obama will travel to the Capitol on Wednesday morning for the meeting with House and Senate Democrats, according to an invitation sent to lawmakers. The White House is casting it as an effort to unite Democrats behind a plan to protect the law, known as the Affordable Care Act, before Republicans have a chance to settle on their own plan for repealing it. Democrats are on edge over the future of the ACA, given the GOP's disdain for \"Obamacare\" and President-elect Donald Trump's vows to gut it. Though Republicans are united behind the notion of repealing the law, they're split over how best to replace it. Some want to strip out unpopular provisions while leaving others intact, while other Republicans prefer a start-from-scratch approach. It's that lack of unanimity among Republicans that Obama and Democrats hope can be exploited, if they can lay the groundwork even before Trump takes office. To that end, Obama also planned to answer questions about the future of the health care law next Friday during a livestreamed event at Blair House, just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Initially stunned by the defeat of Hillary Clinton, Democrats are now trying to organize a counter-attack to preserve the ACA, among the most significant expansions of the social safety net since Medicare and Medicaid were created 50 years ago. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has urged her lawmakers to make health care their focus at the start of the year. Defenders of the law have also launched a political coalition called \"Protect Our Care,\" bringing together more than 20 groups, including the NAACP and the Service Employees International Union. One of their objectives is to try to prevent Republicans from repealing the ACA without also enacting a replacement. (Currently Republicans plan to quickly vote on repealing the law, and delay the effective date to give them time to craft a replacement.) Another goal for Democrats is to pre-empt bigger health care changes to Medicare and Medicaid long sought by Republicans. Since the ACA passed, about 20 million people have gained coverage and the uninsured rate has dropped to a historic low of around 9 percent. Some of the coverage gains are due to employers offering jobs with health care in a stronger economy, but most experts mainly credit Obama's law. A recent poll suggests that defenders of the law may get a receptive hearing from the public. Only about 1 in 4 Americans want Trump and the GOP-led Congress to completely repeal the ACA, according to a post-election survey by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \"Republicans don't fully appreciate the implications of even a partial repeal of the ACA,\" said Rob Restuccia, executive director of Community Catalyst, one of the advocacy groups in the coalition trying to preserve the law. \"People use the analogy of the dog that caught the car.\" Obama's speech in Chicago on Jan. 10 is expected to serve as his closing words to the nation as president. His appearance will be open to the public and followed by a \"family reunion\" for alumni of Obama's former campaigns, according to a save-the-date notice sent to Obama alumni and obtained by The Associated Press. The White House has not confirmed Obama's speech or trip to Chicago. \u2014\u2014\u2014 White House Correspondent Julie Pace and Associated Press writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Dec 30 2016, 11:38 am ET Can VR Make You a Better Person? by Christina Couch A man wearing headphones and VR glasses watches films at the Virtual Reality cinema in Amsterdam. Sander Koning / AFP - Getty Images Share advertisement If the world feels like a colder, meaner place these days, virtual reality may come to the rescue. Researchers across the globe are using immersive digital worlds to place users in someone else's shoes and, at least temporarily, help them become kinder, more compassionate people. Virtual reality is better known for its potential in gaming, but scientists, as well as filmmakers, writers, artists, and designers, are using VR to reduce racial bias, promote environmentalism , encourage empathy for prisoners , humanize political enemies , or even help users make better financial choices. It's working, to some extent. \"We have spent the past fifteen years designing experiments to test the efficacy of VR to teach empathy. Across dozens of studies, a pattern emerges in that VR tends to be a more effective tool than other media and role-playing techniques,\" Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University's Virtual Human Interaction Lab, says via email. Related: 11 Surprising Predictions From the Top Names in Science Though changes are often small, Bailenson adds, studies repeatedly show that virtual reality experiences can impact thoughts and behaviors in the real world. Sun Joo (Grace) Ahn has observed these behavioral changes first hand. In 2011, then a graduate student in Bailenson's lab, Ahn sent study participants a questionnaire to determine how likely they were to understand the perspective of others. Two days later, the participants were provided with basic information about red-green colorblindness \u2014 a visual disorder that causes difficulty distinguishing between certain hues \u2014 and asked to verbally guide a person they believed to be colorblind through a series of virtual reality color-matching exercises. A guest views Prabal Gurung's Samsung Gear 360 photographs on the Samsung Gear VR at Soho Beach House on November 30, 2016 in Miami Beach, Florida. Bryan Bedder / Getty Images Some participants viewed the exercises through a filter that simulated colorblindness, while others completed the exercises without the filter. Ahn found that after seeing the world through a colorblind lens, study subjects who originally weren't as likely to understand the perspective of others showed more favorable attitudes towards colorblind people a full day after the exercise had ended. That attitude also translated into action. A separate experiment that asked study subjects to help a student group attempting to build colorblind-friendly websites showed that participants who experienced virtual colorblindness themselves, even for just a few minutes, spent about twice as long helping, compared to participants in the control group. VR has been shown to drive behavioral changes across a wide array of scenarios. In Barcelona, light-skinned people who navigated a virtual world as a dark-skinned avatar showed lower subconscious racial bias than those who used an avatar with a closer skin tone to their own. To study if taking the perspective of non-human creatures could motivate people to care more about environmental issues, Stanford University created a time-lapse simulation that allows users to assume the avatar of a piece of coral and watch as ocean acidification corrodes their digital limbs. Researchers observed that those who completed the VR experience perceived acidification to be a more imminent environmental problem than people who watched the same images on video without a VR headset. Courtesy of Stanford University But it doesn't take a university-backed research team to create VR empathy initiatives. iAnimal \u2014 a project launched earlier this year by the advocacy group, Animal Equality \u2014 is a series of virtual reality films detailing life inside factory farms. The first installment shows viewers the lifecycle of a factory-farmed pig, from birth to slaughter, in part from the animal's perspective. Since its release, the film has racked up more than 40,000 views and can be experienced in VR at home with Google Cardboard through the organization's YouTube channel. \"We are sure that this is far more impactful than watching a video on a tablet,\" says Jose Valle, Animal Equality co-founder and director of investigations. \"Even if it's difficult and some people cry when they watch it, they think it's really important to show it to others.\" Related: How Computers Are Learning to Predict the Future Virtual reality doesn't just encourage empathy for external beings; it can also teach us to think differently about how we treat ourselves. A separate Stanford study placed research subjects in a virtual environment and had each of them interact with either an avatar that looked like them currently or an avatar designed to look like a future, elderly version of themselves. After exiting the VR environment, subjects who interacted with their elderly selves were significantly more willing to set aside money for retirement than those who interacted with avatars modeled after their current appearances. Ahn, lead author on the coral study and now director of the Games and Virtual Environments Lab at the University of Georgia, says that virtual reality makes an impact, in part because it fills in some of the perceptual blanks that prevent us from truly understanding another person's condition or circumstance. \"Perspective-taking\" \u2014 the process of imagining life from another person's point of view \u2014 often relies on a relatively small amount of information and a lot of imagination as the brain extrapolates all of the various ways that information affects another person's life, often based on assumptions from our own lives. iAnimal users. Courtesy of Animal Equality / Courtesy of Animal Equality With virtual reality, less extrapolation is required. Instead of imagining a world with distorted reds and greens, VR can ask users to search through a digital closet for the right color shirt, feeling all the emotions that go along with that action. Short VR experiences, when compared to traditional video of the same length, make more of an impact because, Ahn believes, VR's extra sensory input helps imprint the experience more in the brain. \"Virtual simulations tend to mimic what you might experience in the physical world so there's a lot more detail for you to create a mental schema, a memory of this experience as if it happened to you in the real world,\" she says. \"When you are trying to recall that experience later on, it's a lot more salient. You have a lot more details to recall. It's easier for you to build this mental map of what you experienced in your memory.\" Related: How the Tech Industry is Tackling the Cancer Moonshot There's a growing body of scientific literature, Ahn's included, dedicated to uncovering how this salience can be used to encourage positive behaviors, but the best ways to get long-lasting effects aren't yet set in stone, and Ahn says more research examining long-term repeated use of empathy-building VR programs is needed. Even with data showing VR's short-term impact, these projects still fight an uphill battle to change the psyche. Projects aimed at reducing racial bias, for example, may provide short exercises that challenge a user's subconscious prejudices, but those projects compete against a daily deluge of information from the real world that reinforces racial bias through experiences like living in segregated neighborhoods and absorbing media that promotes stereotypes. \"Putting people in contact situations, particularly cooperative ones, is the most likely thing to reduce racial prejudice, though it's no guarantee,\" says Jim Blascovich, director of the Research Center for Virtual Environments and Behavior at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Virtual reality can be a tool to facilitate those meaningful experiences and potentially erode bias over time, but it can't magically solve racism, or any other systemic problem, on its own, Blascovich says. Related: This App is Revolutionizing Diagnoses of Rare Diseases Empathy isn't a cure-all either according to Erika Weisz, a graduate student in Stanford University's Social Neuroscience Laboratory who studies how different motivations drive people toward or away from using empathy. The ability to understand the feelings of others is \"morally neutral,\" Weisz says over e-mail, and \"exquisitely context sensitive.\" While empathy can motivate us to act kinder and become better people, it can also \"be hijacked, or used to promote different agendas regardless of their moral composition.\" Both Weisz and Blascovich believe virtual reality can be a valuable tool in helping us better understand others, a significant step to becoming nicer people and enacting positive change. \"It's not a panacea,\" Blascovich says, \"but it's probably as good or better than anything else we've ever tried.\" For more of the breakthroughs changing our lives, follow NBC MACH.

Daily Record 4:39 p.m. EST December 31, 2016 File photo of Jason Robison. (Photo: Pennsylvania State Police) The suspect in the death of a Pennsylvania state trooper was shot and killed Saturday morning in a confrontation with police. Jason Robison, 32, of Hesston, Pa., was killed after refusing orders and making threats to officers during an encounter at an unoccupied\u00a0mobile home not far from the site in Juniata Township, Pa., about 100 miles east of Pittsburgh and 150 miles west of Philadelphia where\u00a0Trooper Landon Weaver, 23, was fatally shot Friday night after responding to a reported violation of a protection-from-abuse order. Robison's death was confirmed at about 10:30 a.m. ET, said Cpl. Adam Reed, a Pennsylvania State Police spokesman. The search for him had focused in the area around the initial call for help and nearby Raystown Lake. He had been arrested more than a dozen times in Huntingdon County, which has about 45,000 residents, on charges that included making threats, assault, theft and driving on a revoked license. Robison last appeared in court Dec. 16\u00a0when he was released on theft and driving charges after posting $10,000 bail. Man found guilty of deliberately driving into state trooper Weaver, originally from about 20 miles away in East Freedom, Pa., enlisted in the Pennsylvania State Police in December 2015, graduated from the police academy in June and was assigned to a patrol unit with Troop G in Huntingdon, Pa. Survivors include his wife, the former Macy Gottshall. She was his high school sweetheart, and they\u00a0married him in June, The (Harrisburg, Pa.) Patriot-News reported. Trooper Landon Weaver of the Pennsylvania State Police was killed Dec. 30, 2016, as he responded to a domestic-abuse complaint \u00a0(Photo: Pennsylvania State Police) He is\u00a0the 97th member of the Pennsylvania State Police to be killed in the line of duty but the only one this year. He is the 139th officer nationwide to die in the line of duty in 2016, the 63rd from gunfire, according to the\u00a0 Officer Down Memorial Page . Pennsylvania State Police released a photo late Friday of the person wanted in connection\u00a0with Weaver's death. In identifying\u00a0Robison, authorities said\u00a0he should be considered armed and dangerous. \u201cIt is believed that his hair is currently dyed purple,\u201d the agency's\u00a0Facebook post added. After the manhunt, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf thanked police for its \"swift resolution.\" \"I thank the troopers and their counterparts who worked through the night and put their lives on the line,\" he wrote in a news release Saturday. Wolf also extended condolences to Weaver's family, saying Weaver will be remembered\u00a0for \u201chis bravery, his sacrifice, and his willingness to serve.\u201d \"Trooper Weaver\u2019s life and service to our commonwealth ended far too soon. May we never forget his sacrifice,\" the governor said. \"Frances and I ask all Pennsylvanians to join us in keeping his wife, family, and fellow troopers in our thoughts and prayers as they confront this horrific tragedy.\" Contributing: The Associated Press.

Lederer and Philip Issa, Associated Press 3:37 p.m. EST December 31, 2016 x Share Russia and Turkey have announced they will work to begin peace talks between the Syrian government and rebel fighters to stop the country's nearly 6-year-old civil war. USA TODAY NETWORK New Zealand ambassador to the United Nations, Gerard Jacobus van Bohemen, left, and Russian ambassador to U.N., Vitaly Churkin, right, are seen during a vote on a cease-fire in Syria at U.N. headquarters in New York on Dec. 31, 2016. (Photo: Jason Szenes, epa) BEIRUT \u2014 The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Saturday supporting efforts by Russia and Turkey to end the nearly six-year conflict in Syria and jump-start peace negotiations, as a fragile country-wide cease-fire wavered. The resolution also calls for the \u201crapid, safe and unhindered\u201d delivery of humanitarian aid throughout Syria. And it anticipates a meeting of the Syrian government and opposition representative in Kazakhstan\u2019s capital Astana in late January. The resolution\u2019s final text dropped an endorsement of the Syria cease-fire agreement reached Thursday, simply taking note of it but welcoming and supporting Russian-Turkish efforts to end the violence. Western members of the council sought the last-minute changes to the draft resolution to clarify the U.N.\u2019s role and the meaning of the agreement brokered by Moscow and Ankara.

    "text": "Putin Says Russia Won't Expel Diplomats In Response To U.S. Sanctions In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U.S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures \"appropriate\" but also \"overdue\" and \"a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.\" Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. \"[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia's worldwide aggression, including its cyber-hacking operations,\" wrote Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. \"Now with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.\" Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks, R-Ariz., called for \"much tougher\" actions and said three times that Obama had \"finally found his tongue.\" Meanwhile, at Mar-a-Lago and on Fox News, various spokesmen for President-elect Trump said Obama's real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. Article continues after sponsorship They spoke of Obama trying to \"tie Trump's hands\" or \"box him in,\" meaning the president-elect would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country's embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged rebel-held city of Aleppo that fell to Assad's forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to \"find\" missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U.S. levels of support for NATO \u2014 Putin's longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump's extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions \u2014 the idea that they helped Trump win \u2014 has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump's legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U.S. intelligence agencies' concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence reports to date and suggested \"no one really knows what happened.\" He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to \"get on with our lives and do more important things.\" However, at week's end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The president-elect has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn), with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil \u2014 the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia's hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U.S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U.S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister's recommended package of tit-for-tat responses. (He even sent an invitation for U.S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be \"the bigger man,\" even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: \"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!\" Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! ",

President Muhammadu Buhari said last week that soldiers had driven Boko Haram from its last forest enclave in the northeast, boasting \u201cthe terrorists are on the run, and no longer have a place to hide.\u201d In a video posted on YouTube, Abubakar Shekau announced: \u201cI am here, well and alive\u201d and that \u201cthe battle is just beginning.\u201d He urged his followers, in graphic terms, to continue the campaign.

Each time such claims are made, the Boko Haram leader reappears in a video to mock them.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Republicans in both houses of Congress have said that repealing the health law is a top priority for the first months of 2017. \u201cThe Obamacare repeal resolution will be the first item up,\u201d said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. Advertisement Continue reading the main story President-elect Donald J. Trump has called the law an \u201cabsolute disaster,\u201d and has said he is eager to sign a repeal bill like one vetoed by President Obama in early 2016. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said the rules devised by House Republicans were \u201ctheir opening salvo\u201d against a law that she said had been \u201csuccessful in meeting its goals of reducing cost, increasing access and improving quality of care.\u201d In a last-ditch bid to save his signature legislative achievement, which has provided coverage to some 20 million Americans, Mr. Obama plans to visit a meeting of House and Senate Democrats on Wednesday to rally support for the law. The Affordable Care Act, approved in 2010 without any Republican votes, provides tax credits to help people buy private insurance. It also allowed states to expand Medicaid eligibility, with the federal government paying most of the cost for new beneficiaries. The law also saves hundreds of billions of dollars by reducing the growth of Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes , health maintenance organizations and other health care providers. Repealing the law would eliminate those savings and thus increase federal spending, the Congressional Budget Office says. Photo Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, left, said the health law \u201chas been successful in meeting its goals of reducing cost, increasing access and improving quality of care.\u201d Credit Al Drago/The New York Times The proposed rules written by House Republicans allow lawmakers to raise a point of order against legislation that causes an increase in certain types of federal spending. But the rules give special protection to bills repealing or \u201creforming\u201d the Affordable Care Act, even if such bills cause a temporary increase in spending. Republicans worry that the Congressional Budget Office could count their plan for replacing the law as new spending, making it subject to challenge on the House floor. The exception being written into House rules would help them avoid that possibility. Ms. Pelosi pointed to this provision as evidence that the health care law, as written, saves money. In their version of the rules, she said, \u201cRepublicans are admitting that repealing the Affordable Care Act will increase costs.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Congressional Budget Office said in 2015 that \u201crepealing the A.C.A. would raise federal deficits by $137 billion over the 2016-2025 period\u201d \u2014 not only because the government would spend more on Medicare, for older Americans, but also because it would collect less in taxes from high-income households. The 2010 law, the budget office noted, increased the payroll tax rate for many high-income taxpayers and imposed a surtax on their net investment income. The law also imposed annual fees on health insurers and manufacturers of brand-name drugs and medical devices. Republicans may want to hold on to some of the tax revenue and Medicare savings, to help offset the cost of their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. They have been trying to devise that replacement, but do not have a consensus and may hold hearings to examine the options. If Congress votes to repeal the health care law early in 2017, Republican leaders say, they may delay the effective date for several years, to avoid disrupting coverage for people who have recently gained it. The Republican rules package would also allow the House to continue its legal challenge to spending on insurance subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs for more than six million Americans. In addition, the rules would require House committee chairmen to propose ways of imposing more fiscal discipline on federal entitlement programs. In the jargon of the federal budget, the goal is to switch some programs from \u201cmandatory funding\u201d to \u201cdiscretionary appropriations,\u201d over which Congress has greater control. This rule mirrors ideas advanced by Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia and chairman of the House Budget Committee, whom Mr. Trump has selected to be his secretary of health and human services. \u201cTwo-thirds of current expenditures are dedicated to a relatively small number of automatic spending programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security , which are not subject to annual appropriations and therefore operate largely outside the control of Congress,\u201d Mr. Price said in a recent speech.

    "text": "But Mrs. Dukakis was desperate. Rehabilitation, talk therapy and antidepressants had failed to ease her crippling depression, so in 2001, at age 64, she turned to shock therapy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story To her amazement, it helped. After the first treatment, Mrs. Dukakis wrote, \u201cI felt alive,\u201d as if a cloud had lifted \u2014 so much so that when Mr. Dukakis picked her up at Massachusetts General Hospital, she astonished him by proposing that they go out to dinner. \u201cI was so shocked I almost drove off Storrow Drive,\u201d Mr. Dukakis recalled. \u201cI had left this wife of mine at the hospital a basket case just the night before.\u201d Now, 15 years later, the Dukakises have emerged as the nation\u2019s most prominent evangelists for electroconvulsive therapy. Truth be told, there is not much competition. Few boldface names who have had the treatment will acknowledge as much; the stigma is still too great. Exceptions include Carrie Fisher , the actress and writer who died Tuesday , and Dick Cavett, the talk-show host; both have openly discussed their positive experiences. Electroconvulsive therapy is not a one-and-done procedure. Mrs. Dukakis, 80, still receives maintenance treatment every seven or eight weeks. She said that she had minor memory lapses but that the treatment had banished her demons and that she no longer drank, smoked or took antidepressants. She went public with her use of electroshock in 2006 in her book, \u201cShock: The Healing Power of Electroconvulsive Therapy,\u201d which she wrote with the journalist Larry Tye. Photo Treatment electrodes connected to an electroconvulsive therapy device at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., where Mrs. Dukakis receives her maintenance therapy. Credit M. Scott Brauer for The New York Times These days she and her husband \u2014 who is 83 and still teaching full time at Northeastern University \u2014 devote their time to promoting ECT. They hold support groups at their Victorian home outside Boston here; manage a website, ecttreatment.org ; and answer inquiries from people seeking guidance. Their efforts include trying to persuade the Department of Veterans Affairs to make the procedure more accessible. Mrs. Dukakis also gives speeches around the country and abroad. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As they bear witness, the Dukakises face decades of prejudice against a treatment that Mrs. Dukakis credits with saving her life. \u201cI have lots to be grateful for,\u201d she says, snuggling her cockapoo puppy. \u201cAnd lots to look forward to.\u201d Wary of Treatment During the 1988 campaign, Mrs. Dukakis said, she generally limited herself to one shot of vodka at night, though she did go on a couple of benders that forced her to cancel appearances. All that changed with the election, when her husband lost 40 states to George Bush. Two days later, her long-masked depression came roaring back; she lost herself in the bottle and spent the next several years in and out of rehab. In the mornings, she would see her husband off to work, then drink, retreat to her room and pass out. Her family sometimes found her passed out in her vomit. \u201cOnce I came home and couldn\u2019t find her,\u201d Mr. Dukakis recalled. \u201cI finally went up to the third floor, and I saw what I thought was a bunch of rags on the floor. It was my wife. This beautiful \u2026\u201d His voice broke off. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said. Though she and her husband had heard about electroconvulsive therapy, they were wary. Mr. Dukakis\u2019s older brother, Stelian, had had an ECT session in 1951 and was never the same. Mrs. Dukakis\u2019s sister\u2019s husband also had ECT therapy in the 1950s but had kept it secret. When he learned that Mrs. Dukakis was considering it, he told her that he had had a positive outcome; he lost some memory, but his psychosis was gone. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Benefits, With Risks No one knows exactly how electroshock eases depression, if only temporarily, in many people. It sends an electrical current to the brain that triggers a brief seizure . The result is like rebooting a computer, say those who have had positive results. Shock therapy was developed in 1938. Back then, patients were not given anesthesia , and the electrical current was much stronger. It was in fairly wide use by the 1960s. Patients included Sylvia Plath, the poet; Clementine Churchill, the wife of Winston Churchill; and Senator Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri, the 1972 Democratic vice-presidential candidate, who was booted off the ticket when his treatment was made public. Photo \u201cDepression is a chronic and recurring illness that requires good lifetime management,\u201d Dr. Charles Welch, Mrs. Dukakis\u2019s psychiatrist, said. Credit M. Scott Brauer for The New York Times But electroshock fell out of favor with the growth of antidepressants and the release of \u201cCuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d Critics say proponents deliberately minimize the dangers \u2014 starting with their use of sanitizing nomenclature like \u201cECT.\u201d Among the criticisms: that memory problems can be far more severe than doctors say; that relapses are almost inevitable; and that the procedure causes brain damage, a point in sharp dispute. Jonathan Cott, a writer and editor, wrote in his 2005 book, \u201cOn the Sea of Memory: A Journey From Forgetting to Remembering,\u201d that his shock therapy had wiped out 15 years of memories. They included events like the murder of John Lennon, whom Mr. Cott had interviewed just three days before the shooting. Mr. Cott forgot books he had written and edited and friends listed in his address book. \u201cThe pact with the devil that is ECT,\u201d he wrote, \u201crequires that one trade certain memory loss (short-term, long-term or both), possible brain damage and cognitive dysfunction for the temporary relief of depression.\u201d Despite its negative image, ECT has remained the go-to option for severely depressed people who do not respond well to antidepressants or other treatments. It is usually fast acting, which can mean the difference between life and death in patients who are suicidal. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cPublic awareness of the use of ECT has waxed and waned, but in medical practice, we have continuously used it,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Lisanby, a specialist in ECT at the National Institute of Mental Health. In the old days, patients convulsed during therapy sessions, sometimes so violently that they broke their bones or teeth. Today, with anesthesia and muscle relaxants, such reactions are rare. \u201cECT is the single most efficacious treatment that we have and the treatment of choice if you absolutely had to get someone out of a severe depression within a day or two,\u201d said Steven D. Hollon, a professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University, who has studied the treatment of depression. But, he added, electroconvulsive therapy can potentially cause serious side effects, most notably long-term memory problems, some of which are temporary. Even patients whose depression goes into remission almost always need maintenance treatment, with ECT, antidepressants or both. A National Institute of Mental Health study conducted in 2014 and released this year found that new ECT techniques designed to better protect memory, in combination with antidepressants, fully relieved symptoms in 61 percent of severely depressed elderly patients; some were still well six months later. (Of the others, 28 percent dropped out and 10 percent did not improve.) Mrs. Dukakis receives her maintenance therapy at McLean Hospital in suburban Boston, one of the world\u2019s largest and most renowned psychiatric hospitals. McLean does about 10,000 such treatments a year, up from 2,500 treatments in 1999, Dr. Stephen Seiner, McLean\u2019s director of ECT, said. Each patient generally receives eight to 20 treatments. Photo Mrs. Dukakis, right, hosting an electroconvulsive therapy support group at her home in December. Credit M. Scott Brauer for The New York Times \u201cFor most patients,\u201d said Mrs. Dukakis\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Charles Welch, \u201cdepression is a chronic and recurring illness that requires good lifetime management.\u201d Varied Experiences It was a frosty Sunday night in December, and Mrs. Dukakis, stylishly dressed in a starched white blouse and royal blue sweater with pearls, was seated on her living room couch. Her husband, in a flannel shirt and khakis, sat beside her. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nine others, who make up part of their ECT support group, sat in a circle. Three women had had shock therapy and came with their husbands; another woman and two men came on behalf of deeply depressed family members and wanted to learn more. As the meeting began, Mrs. Dukakis explained that she and her husband would be celebrating \u201cmy 50th birthday.\u201d People chuckled, assuming she was joking about her age, but she did not appear to be, prompting Mr. Dukakis to remind her that it would be her 80th. Two women who had received ECT spoke positively about it. A third, a doctor named Barrie Baker, had a very different experience. \u201cAfter the first time, I couldn\u2019t remember the season or the year,\u201d Dr. Baker said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever fully recovered.\u201d She said she preferred being treated with medications. \u201cYou can stop a medication, and the side effects will go away,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the things that happen with ECT can take months to go away.\u201d The group discussed whether it was better to hold off on ECT as a last resort or seek it sooner if drugs did not help immediately. \u201cGiven Kitty\u2019s experience,\u201d Mr. Dukakis said, \u201cI can\u2019t support the notion that you try everything else before you try ECT. Those 17 years before we finally got to ECT were brutal.\u201d A woman named Deborah, who came on behalf of her husband and did not want her last name used, said her husband had been so depressed, she had dropped a letter in Mrs. Dukakis\u2019s mailbox several months ago seeking help. Mrs. Dukakis arranged for the man to meet with Dr. Welch. He received ECT but remains severely depressed. Still, Deborah is grateful to the Dukakises. Advertisement ",

Security officials say the first blast went off at around 8 a.m. local time; as people gathered to help the wounded, a man detonated a suicide vest. At least 28 people were killed and more than 50 others were wounded in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Several agencies are filling vacant positions with new hires and transfers before Trump, a Republican, takes office January 20, according to the newspaper, which based its report on interviews and internal federal documents. The hiring rush comes amid an agreement after the November election that no new hires would be made after Dec. 1, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told the newspaper Friday. The White House Office of Management and Budget said Saturday that the administration imposed a moratorium Dec. 7 on hiring senior executives within the civil service, a policy consistent with previous transitions to ensure incoming agency leaders can make or approve executive hiring decisions. Spicer declined to comment on whether he thinks the administration broke the hiring agreement, considering the transition team has yet to receive details about new hires and jobs being offered after the December deadline. \u00a0 Among the agencies making hires are the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Transportation Security Administration and sections of the departments of Agriculture and Labor, according to the newspaper.

President Obama has retaliated with new sanctions against the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin for what intelligence officials have concluded was meddling in the U.S. election. (Associated Press) Del Quentin Wilber Contact Reporter Malicious software tied to Russian intelligence agencies has been found on a computer of a small electric utility in northern Vermont, raising concerns of Russian attempts to interfere with critical infrastructure as well as the 2016 presidential race. The laptop computer was not connected to the electric system, and the malware did not disrupt electric grid operations or compromise customer data, according to the Burlington Electric Department and a U.S. law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity. The disclosure comes amid rising tensions with Russia over U.S. charges that Russia\u2019s two largest intelligence agencies, known as the GRU and the FSB, conducted an aggressive campaign of cyberattacks that U.S. officials code-named \u201cGrizzly Steppe.\u201d On Thursday, President Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats from Washington and San Francisco, closed two Russian luxury compounds in Maryland and New York, and imposed sanctions on the GRU and the FSB. Burlington Electric, a municipally owned utility that serves about 20,000 customers, said late Friday that it found the malware after the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert as part of the Obama administration\u2019s actions.\u00a0 The DHS alert detailed technical aspects of the Grizzly Steppe attacks, which it said were aimed at \u201cthe U.S. election, as well as a range of U.S. government, political, and private sector entities.\u201d Federal authorities shared the malware code with executives from 16 major sectors of the U.S. economy, including the financial, utility and transportation industries, officials said. Mike Kanarick, a Burlington Electric spokesman, said the utility scanned all the computers in its system for the malware signature. \u201cWe detected the malware in a single Burlington Electric Department laptop not connected to our organization\u2019s grid systems,\u201d Kanarick said in a statement . \u201cWe took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alerted federal officials of this finding. Our team is working with federal officials to trace this malware and prevent any other attempts to infiltrate utility systems.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear whether the small utility was specifically targeted or why, or when the laptop was compromised.\u00a0 Authorities believe the hackers may be seeking to identify and penetrate vulnerabilities in the U.S. electric grid, perhaps by using small rural utilities. Vermont\u2019s elected officials reacted with alarm to the cyberattack. Gov. Peter Shumlin , a Democrat, urged federal authorities to launch an aggressive investigation. He also rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin . \u201cVermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world\u2019s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality of life, economy, health\u00a0and safety,\u201d Shumlin said in a statement. Current tensions, highlighted by President Obama \u2019s decision to impose sanctions and expel 35 Russian diplomats, is exceptional because it stems... U.S. relations with Moscow during and after the Cold War have been marred by diplomatic dust-ups ranging from espionage scandals to an Olympic boycott. Current tensions, highlighted by President Obama \u2019s decision to impose sanctions and expel 35 Russian diplomats, is exceptional because it stems... (Robert Burns) Sen. Patrick J. Leahy\u00a0(D-Vt.) said Vermont State Police\u00a0briefed him Friday evening on the attempts to penetrate the electric grid. \u201cThis is beyond hackers having electronic joy rides \u2014 this is now about trying to access utilities to potentially manipulate the grid and shut it down in the middle of winter,\u201d Leahy said in a statement. \u201cThat is a direct threat to Vermont and we do not take it lightly.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump , who has vowed to improve relations with Russia, on Friday applauded Putin\u2019s decision not to directly retaliate against\u00a0new U.S. sanctions by expelling American diplomats.\u00a0 \u201cI always knew he was very smart!\u201d Trump tweeted.

Fallon / For The Times Jamie Meach, right, with her family, holds a portrait that includes her husband, Meach Sovannara. Jamie Meach, right, with her family, holds a portrait that includes her husband, Meach Sovannara. (Patrick T. Fallon / For The Times) James Queally When Meach Sovannara boarded a flight to Cambodia in 2015, his wife and three daughters knew there was a chance he might never return to their modest Long Beach home. Jamie Meach was no stranger to her husband\u2019s battles with the Cambodian government. It was Sovannara\u2019s\u00a0activism, after all, that forced\u00a0the family to seek asylum in the United States\u00a0more than a decade earlier. He had returned to Cambodia since then, but protests that followed a controversial national election had\u00a0endangered\u00a0Sovannara\u2019s safety once more. A dual citizen of the U.S. and Cambodia, Sovannara was\u00a0charged\u00a0with attempting to incite an insurrection in 2014 after delivering a speech at a protest in Phonm Penh, the country\u2019s capital.\u00a0 Sovannara returned to the U.S. after being released on bond, but with a court hearing looming, he had a choice to make: Live safely in exile in Long Beach, or risk imprisonment to\u00a0continue the fight against a government that has been widely criticized for human rights violations.\u00a0 Despite the risks, Jamie Meach and her husband knew he had to return home. In July\u00a02015, Sovannara and 10 others were convicted of various crimes connected to the protests after what human rights activists have called a \u201cshow trial.\u201d Sovannara\u2019s attorneys were not\u00a0allowed to enter closing arguments, and justices deliberated for 15 minutes before returning with a conviction, according to Amnesty International. Although\u00a0no evidence was presented at trial, Sovannara\u00a0was sentenced to 20 years in Prey Sar prison, a hellish, overcrowded complex where family and friends fear he could be killed at any moment. Meach Sovannara leaves an appellate court hearing in Cambodia in 2016. Associated Press Meach Sovannara leaves an appellate court hearing in Cambodia in 2016. Meach Sovannara leaves an appellate court hearing in Cambodia in 2016. (Associated Press) An appeal of Sovannara\u2019s conviction was denied earlier this year. But friends and activists hope a\u00a0federal\u00a0lawsuit brought against the Cambodian government\u00a0in Los Angeles and diplomatic pressures exerted in Washington will\u00a0help secure his release. But as those wheels turn slowly, Sovannara\u2019s stand has left his family trapped in an international nightmare, one that has roiled Long Beach\u2019s sprawling\u00a0Cambodian refugee community and agitated lawmakers tasked with managing diplomatic relations\u00a0between Washington and Phnom Penh. As\u00a0they hold out hope, some say Sovannara made peace with the potential consequences of his decision long before returning to his native land. \u201cMeach Sovannara already knows his fate,\u201d said Bo K.S. Uce, a\u00a0family friend and activist. Huddled close with her daughters, Jamie Meach said she doesn\u2019t regret her husband\u2019s gamble. The fight against Hun Sen, the former Khmer Rouge commander\u00a0who has served as Cambodia\u2019s prime minister for nearly 30 years and is considered a dictator by human rights advocates, was more important than their family\u2019s needs. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, both of us\u00a0\u2026 Hun Sen\u2019s violations of human rights, his oppressions of democracy, and everything like that,\u201d\u00a0she said through an interpreter. \u201cSo I had to, for my own self, I had to sacrifice in order for my husband to help liberate Cambodia.\u201d When the couple first met in 1994, they\u00a0were schoolteachers in Cambodia\u2019s Bonteay Meanchey Province, well off the radar of a national government that has routinely met dissent with brutal reprisals. They\u00a0married\u00a0five years later, Jamie Meach said. But as their bond grew, so did Sovannara\u2019s desire to help expose\u00a0government abuses, past and present. Sovannara had worked as a journalist before he became a teacher,\u00a0and he returned to the field as a reporter and host\u00a0with Radio Free Asia shortly after the couple wed, Jamie Meach said.\u00a0For the next several years, Sovannara would publish stories that were highly critical of the government, taking specific aim at misuse of funds and allegations of election rigging by the Cambodian People\u2019s Party, the political powerhouse that has controlled Cambodia for decades, Jamie Meach said. Sometime in 2003, Sovannara became embroiled in an argument with Sar Kheng, a former Khmer Rouge commander and congressman who is\u00a0now the Cambodian minister of the interior, and Jamie Meach immediately grew concerned.\u00a0Reporters who criticize the government\u00a0often face arrest, or worse.\u00a0 In Sovannara\u2019s case, it was the latter. The death threats began within days, Jamie Meach said.\u00a0After men on\u00a0motorcycles came to their home and tried to break in, the coupledecided to flee to Long Beach. \u201cWe had to come as tourists first, then apply for asylum,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise they would have killed us.\u201d The family arrived in Long Beach in 2003, and they were\u00a0granted asylum in 2004,\u00a0Jamie Meach said. For the next nine years, Sovannara largely remained in Long Beach,\u00a0working with Jamie Meach to publish a Khmer-language newspaper.\u00a0He would occasionally travel back to Cambodia to visit his mother, never explaining how he was able to remain safe,\u00a0she said. Nine years would pass before Sovannara could openly return to his native land.\u00a0With the Cambodian government under increasing international pressure to hold fair elections, Sovannara became\u00a0the media director for the insurgent\u00a0Cambodia National Rescue Party in\u00a02013\u00a0and began making trips to Phnom Penh.\u00a0 After closer-than-expected parliamentary elections \u2014\u00a0which many Cambodians believed had been\u00a0stolen\u00a0by Hun Sen\u2014\u00a0a popular uprising was met with brutal police crackdowns.\u00a0 \u201cThe 2013 election was a wake-up call for the authorities who thought they had everything under control,\u201d said Sophal Ear, a professor at Occidental College and expert on Cambodian politics. Anti-government protests lasted for months in Phnom Penh\u2019s Freedom Park, and violent\u00a0clashes with national police led to the park\u2019s closure. Sovannara participated in a July 2014 rally calling for the park to be reopened. During that speech, he criticized Hun Sen\u2019s administration for ceding land to Vietnam in a border dispute, Jamie Meach said. \u00a0 (James Queally) Those\u00a0remarks kick started the dubious criminal proceedings that led to Sovannara\u2019s imprisonment. Now, with almost no way to communicate with him, Sovannara\u2019s family waits in Long Beach, fearful that Prey Sar prison may become his tomb. Experts on Cambodian politics\u00a0describe the facility as an overcrowded, brutal lockup that is\u00a0a haven for disease.\u00a0Sovannara could be killed in a staged fight, poisoned at mealtime\u00a0or beaten by guards at the government\u2019s behest, his family and activists contend.\u00a0 In September, Sovannara, who has been in poor health due to a severe head injury suffered in a 2015 car accident, experienced a medical emergency and\u00a0had to be rushed to a Phnom\u00a0Penh hospital.\u00a0 The news set off a series of panicked phone calls back in Long Beach.\u00a0Prisoners taken to that hospital rarely leave alive, said Morton Sklar, an attorney with Human Rights Watch who is representing the Sovannara family. Sklar believes the transfer was an intimidation tactic, noting that\u00a0Sovannara was hospitalized just days after a federal judge in Los Angeles refused to toss the family\u2019s federal lawsuit against the Cambodian government. Asked how Sovannara\u2019s speech could result in such a stiff prison sentence, government spokesman Phay Siphan simply said, \u201cIt is illegal to protest,\u201d when contacted by The Times. He referred all further questions to the Justice Ministry. Siphan did not respond to a list of questions e-mailed from The Times. Whether the transfer was meant to scare his loved ones, Sovanarra\u2019s medical situation is dire, Jamie Meach said. Based on what little information she can gather from relatives living in Cambodia, she\u00a0said her husband is suffering from chronic migraines, high blood pressure, jaundice and diarrhea inside Prey Sar. An appeal for his release based on his medical condition was rejected in October, she\u00a0said. Sovannara\u2019s relatives\u00a0and activists believe a combination of diplomatic and legal pressures could lead to his release,\u00a0and Sklar said the federal lawsuit against the Cambodian government \u2014 specifically Sen\u2019s oldest son, Hun Manet \u2014 might\u00a0prove key.\u00a0 While foreign governments are normally immune to legal action in U.S. courts, Sklar believes Sovannara\u2019s case represents an exemption under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, passed in the wake of the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and aimed at helping victims of state terrorist acts abroad recoup financial damages. In the current suit, Sklar has argued that Sovannara\u2019s unlawful imprisonment by the Cambodian government has caused harm\u00a0to his wife and children, who are U.S. citizens. Still, Sklar acknowledges that it may take a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of pressures from\u00a0the lawsuit and American lawmakers to set Sovannara free. Other\u00a0experts warn there is little anyone in Washington can do about his imprisonment.\u00a0 Many U.S. lawmakers are fiercely opposed to Hun Sen\u2019s authoritarian rule, said\u00a0Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow with the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations.\u00a0But with Cambodia now relying more heavily on China for aid, the U.S. is limited in the kind of financial leverage it can exert, he said. State Department officials might also be reluctant to intervene because Sovannara is a dual citizen, said Ear, the Occidental College professor. \u201cThe U.S., I feel, sees such individuals as having mixed loyalties or having signed\u00a0up for this by way of involvement in Cambodian politics,\u201d he\u00a0said. A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss Sovanarra\u2019s case, told The Times that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh have had regular visits with\u00a0Sovannara. Their last known contact with him was on Oct. 21, according to the official, who said embassy officials \u201cregularly raise his and similar cases in our high-level engagement with senior officials from the Government of Cambodia.\u201d U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Cambodia earlier this year\u00a0and raised concerns about human rights abuses during a trip that otherwise focused on economic ties between the U.S. and Cambodia,\u00a0according to media reports. A spokesman for the State Department would not say whether\u00a0Kerry discussed Sovanarra\u2019s case with Hun Sen. U.S. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (D-Long Beach), who sits on the House Foreign Affairs committee, has also criticized the Cambodian government for its treatment of Sovannara and warned that the unfair imprisonment of a U.S. citizen could negatively impact diplomatic relations between the two countries. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through this trying to get people out of Vietnam in the same way, and I think we need to push our embassy to do as much as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all about the future relationship between Cambodia and the U.S..\u201d Lowenthal has asked the State Department to monitor the status of Sovannara\u2019s appeal. He has also repeatedly pushed to make free and fair elections a condition of any financial aid offered to Phnom Penh by lawmakers. If Sovannara\u2019s case has caused irritation in Washington, it has infuriated\u00a0Long Beach\u2019s large Cambodian refugee community. Hundreds of Cambodia Town residents attended a\u00a0rally at an area church this summer, with many calling for Sovannara\u2019s release as pictures of him in an orange prison jumpsuit dotted the room. When\u00a0Hun Manet\u00a0visited Long Beach on a diplomatic mission earlier this year, his trip was marred by a violent clash connected to Sovannara\u2019s case.\u00a0 Hun Manet, a high-ranking commander in the Cambodian military, came to the U.S. in an attempt to mend fences with large Cambodian communities in Long Beach and Lowell, Mass. His trip was\u00a0met with large-scale protests in both cities, and\u00a0a private investigator who attempted to serve him\u00a0with the lawsuit brought by Sovannara\u2019s family said\u00a0he was attacked by the general\u2019s guards on April 9.\u00a0Several local activists claim the assailant or assailants were members of Hun Manet\u2019s private guard. Long Beach police are investigating the attack, but would not comment on a possible suspect. Multiple calls to the Cambodian Consulate\u00a0in Long Beach were not\u00a0returned. A\u00a0federal judge in Los Angeles allowed the suit to continue, and the Cambodian government has served notice that it will not defend the case, according to Sklar. A default judgment against Hun Manet is likely, Sklar said. The same judge also issued an order allowing Sklar to submit written questions to Hun Manet about myriad human rights abuses committed under his father\u2019s regime. Hun Manet answered those, according to Sklar, though the documents are not yet public. \u201cHun Manet\u00a0and the government of Cambodia are going to be in the position of being forced to disclose a lot of information that will be greatly embarrassing to them,\u201d said Sklar, who hopes the threat of that discovery could help leverage Sovannara\u2019s release. In Long Beach, activists like Uce remain hopeful, but they are also realistic about the odds Sovannara faces. But Uce believes Hun Sen has made one critical mistake: The longer he holds Sovannara prisoner, the more powerful his story becomes.\u00a0 \u201cEverybody loves life,\u201d Uce said. \u201cBut sometimes the sacrifice has meaning.\u201d \u00a0 ",

Three U.S. Republican senators \u2014 including Kansas' Jerry Moran and Pat Roberts \u2014 demanded this month that the Department of Homeland Security provide immigration records for 38-year-old Tomas Martinez-Maldonado, who is charged with a felony in the alleged Sept. 27 attack aboard a bus in Geary County. He is being held in the Geary County jail in Junction City, which is about 120 miles west of Kansas City. U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, from Iowa and chairman of the judiciary committee, co-signed a Dec. 9 letter with Moran and Roberts to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, calling it \"an extremely disturbing case\" and questioning how Martinez-Maldonado was able to re-enter and remain in the country. More on this... Immigration advocates in Maryland looking to protect undocumented community U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it has placed a detainer \u2014 a request to turn Martinez-Maldonado over to ICE custody before he is released \u2014 with Geary County. ICE declined to discuss his specific case beyond its October statement regarding the 10 deportations. Court filings show Martinez-Maldonado has two misdemeanor convictions for entering without legal permission in cases prosecuted in 2013 and 2015 in U.S. District Court of Arizona, where he was sentenced to serve 60 days and 165 days respectively. A status hearing in the rape case is scheduled for Jan. 10. Defense attorney Lisa Hamer declined to comment on the charge, but said, \"criminal law and immigration definitely intersect and nowadays it should be the responsibility of every criminal defense attorney to know the possible ramifications in the immigration courts.\" Nationwide, 52 percent of all federal prosecutions in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 were for entry or re-entry without legal permission and similar immigration violations, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. It's not unusual to see immigrants with multiple entries without legal permission, said David Trevino, a Topeka immigration attorney who has provided legal advice to Martinez-Maldonado's family. Most of Martinez-Maldonado's family lives in Mexico, but he also has family in the United States, and the family is \"devastated,\" Trevino said. \"(President-elect Donald Trump) can build a wall 100 feet high and 50 feet deep, but it is not going to keep family members separated. So if someone is deported and they have family members here ... they will find a way back \u2014 whether it is through the air, under a wall, through the coast of the United States,\" Trevino said. He declined to comment on Martinez-Maldonado's criminal history and pending charge. Records obtained by AP show Martinez-Maldonado had eight voluntary removals before his first deportation in 2010, which was followed by another voluntary removal that same year. He was deported five more times between 2011 and 2013. In 2013, Martinez-Maldonado was charged with entering without legal permission, a misdemeanor, and subsequently deported in early 2014 after serving his sentence. He was deported again a few months later, as well as twice in 2015 \u2014 including the last one in October 2015 after he had served his second sentence, the records show. ICE said in an emailed statement that when it encounters a person who's been deported multiple times or has a significant criminal history and was removed, it routinely presents those cases to the U.S. attorney's office for possible criminal charges. Cosme Lopez, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Arizona, declined comment on why prosecutors twice dismissed felony re-entry after deportation charges against Martinez-Maldonado in 2013 and 2015 in exchange for guilty pleas on misdemeanor entry charges. Arizona ranks third in the nation \u2014 behind only the Southern District of Texas and the Western District of Texas \u2014 for the number of immigration prosecutions among the nation's 94 federal judicial districts for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse records show. Moran told the AP in an email that the immigration system is \"broken.\" \"There must be serious legislative efforts to address U.S. immigration policy, and we must have the ability to identify, prosecute and deport illegal aliens who display violent tendencies before they have an opportunity to perpetrate these crimes in the United States,\" he said.

(Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune) The bison brought to Nachusa Grasslands in 2014 have proliferated, and the herd that once numbered 20 now has a total of 90 bison. (Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune) Ted Gregory Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Once while Bernie Buchholz was on his hands and knees deeply engaged in his restoration work at Nachusa Grasslands, something caught his eye and he looked up. Staring back at him a few yards away was a 1,700-pound bison bull. \"It's not so much frightening as it is presence-building,\" Buchholz said of the animals brought two years ago to the 4,000-acre prairie restoration project about 95 miles west of Chicago. They are the first authentically wild herd east of the Mississippi River since the 1830s. \"I have been jolted into presence by these beautiful animals,\" he added. Figuratively speaking, jolt might be the appropriate term to describe the bison's impact at Nachusa. Remote Stonebarn Road along the reserve has experienced bumper-to-bumper traffic from bison groupies. Volunteer work days at the grasslands have drawn record attendance. Nachusa has established a Bison Corps to make sure the animals' basic needs are met. The phrase staff uses to describe the entire phenomenon is Bison Mania. Nachusa Grasslands map Tribune Graphics Tribune Graphics That attraction may stem from what Buchholz called the animals' \"mystery\" and their status as a metaphor for America's cultural, natural and environmental history. \"I think it's going swimmingly,\" said Buchholz, president of Friends of Nachusa Grasslands. \"When you see how joyful people are when they see the animals, it's really amazing.\" The bison project, started in 2014 to boost the grasslands restoration at Nachusa, has had setbacks. Managers directed that two bulls be killed by rifle shot after they escaped Nachusa in early December and refused to return. Two calves and a female cow died this year. Prairie restoration workers occasionally must move their targeted work zones to accommodate bison grazing. But the herd's population has grown to a robust 90, from the original herd of 20 brought in October 2014 from Broken Kettle Grasslands preserve near Sioux City, Iowa, said Nachusa Project Director Bill Kleiman. (Ted Gregory) A total of 17 calves were born this year. If the herd continues to grow, Kleiman said, the Nature Conservancy may send bison to other reserves or sell some animals for meat next year. Meanwhile, work continues on a visitors' shelter, and the conservancy, the international nonprofit that owns Nachusa, is planning to add acres to the grasslands reserve. In addition, early signs indicate that the animals may be performing the task they were brought here to do. \"There's a little bit more work involved in having these animals out there than if they weren't out there,\" Kleiman said, \"but that's OK. I like to work. I haven't gotten a bit tired of seeing them. I think they're fun and they're smart.\" Illinois, the Prairie State, once had about 22 million acres of prairie, or about 60 percent of its land, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources reports. Over time, most was converted to farmland. Today, about 2,500 acres, or one 100th of 1 percent, of the prairie remains. The Nature Conservancy began acquiring land in the area in 1986 with the primary goal of returning it to native prairie. Voracious grazers that prefer to eat grass, bison help clear the landscape for native flowers and plants and attract a diversity of insects, birds and other animals. The Bison herd brought to Nachusa Grasslands in 2014 has proliferated and the herd that once numbered 20 now has a total of 90 bison. The long-term result is supposed to be a healthy prairie biodiversity that, among other benefits, sequesters carbon and replenishes the soil. As part of the overall assessment of the Nachusa restoration, researchers are examining its impact on grassland birds, small mammals, deer, soil diversity and bees, to name a few. It is too early to determine the scope of the bison's impact on the restoration. Kleiman said that will take years, perhaps decades. But anecdotal evidence points to a more diverse prairie landscape, Nachusa researchers said. Buchholz and Holly Jones, an assistant professor and conservation biologist from Northern Illinois University who has been working at Nachusa since 2013, said the bison have created different heights and densities of prairie, a heterogeneous landscape that is expected to attract diverse bird species. The bison also have been eating around wildflower forbs \u2014 an encouraging sign for prairie diversity. In addition, birds and rodents at Nachusa are using bison fur to build their nests, researchers said. And, existing animal species have not been damaged by the bison's arrival. The Nachusa experience is Jones' first exposure to wild bison in a natural setting. \"It's a really fun place to work,\" she said. \"It's a restoration ecologist's playground, like taking a step back in history, especially since bison are out there.\" ",

    "text": "It's time for Ronda Rousey to retire, says UFC champion Amanda Nunes Amanda Nunes post-fight interview Women's bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes discusses her victory over Ronda Rousey at UFC 207. Women's bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes discusses her victory over Ronda Rousey at UFC 207. Amanda Nunes had all the answers against Ronda Rousey before beating her by technical knockout in 48 seconds Friday night, and then the subject turned afterward to Rousey\u2019s fighting future. And Nunes was assertive again. \u201cThat\u2019s it for her. For sure, she\u2019s going to retire,\u201d Nunes said in her post-fight news conference. \u201cShe can\u2019t take any more. If she wanted a rematch, it\u2019d be the same thing.\u201d Nunes (14-4) pelted Rousey with punches before referee Herb Dean stepped in to stop the fight as Rousey fell backward from\u00a0a four-punch combination. The UFC bantamweight champion then proceeded to question the strategy of\u00a0Rousey\u2019s Glendale-based coach, Edmond Tarverdyan. \u201cHe thinks she\u2019s a boxer. He\u2019s put that in her head. I don\u2019t know why he did that,\u201d Nunes said of Rousey, the 2008 Olympic bronze medalist in judo who repeatedly submitted\u00a0foes by first-round armbars until trying to stand and strike against former pro boxing champion Holly Holm at UFC 193 on Nov. 15, 2015. Rousey was knocked out by a head kick in that bout and did not fight again until Friday night in Las Vegas. \u201cShe had great judo. She could do more in this division, but [Tarverdyan\u2019s] done this crazy [strategy] with boxing, and it\u2019s had her go down.\u201d An audio recording of Tarverdyan\u2019s panicked instruction during the bout emerged by Saturday morning, casting more doubt over his future should Rousey decide to continue in the UFC. \u201cWhat she does [with Tarverdyan] is up to her,\u201d UFC President Dana White said after meeting with Rousey for 40 minutes in her dressing room after the loss. White characterized Rousey\u2019s post-defeat mood as \u201cdown, but not as down as the Holm loss.\u201d And while Rousey maintained her media ban by leaving the arena without speaking to reporters, White said he will seek to have Rousey participate in a news conference about her future likely in January. White said, \u201cI think [Rousey] will,\u201d return to fight in the UFC again. Photos from UFC 207, featuring the main event between Ronda Rousey and Amanda Nunes. One viable path in that strategy would be a rematch with Holm, who is fighting for the title in the\u00a0newly created featherweight division. Rousey could also move up\u00a0to the more comfortable weight to meet her. Should featherweight Cris \u201cCyborg\u201d Justino avoid a year-long suspension because of a\u00a0recent positive test for a diuretic, she too could be an intriguing opponent. Rousey issued a statement Saturday to ESPN, which said, \"Returning to not just fighting, but winning, was my entire focus this past year. However, sometimes \u2014 even when you prepare and give everything you have and want something so badly \u2014 it doesn't work how you planned. I take pride in seeing how far the women's division has come in the UFC and commend all the other women who have been part of making this possible, including Amanda. \"I need to take some time to reflect and think about the future.\" White heaped praise on Nunes, who won the title in July by dominating Miesha Tate in the first round with\u00a040 punches and a chokehold submission. Tate, who had won the belt by defeating Holm in her first title defense, soon retired. \u201cMiesha Tate told me, \u2018[Nunes] hits so hard \u2026 there\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve tapped out in that fight, but I was so hurt by those hits,\u2019\u201d White said. \u201cShe retired Miesha.\u201d Nunes takes pride in how her training in Florida has sparked improved striking. \u201cI know nobody can take my punches,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I started connecting with punches, I knew she appreciated [my power]. I saw it from the first punch. I wait for the right moment to connect my punches and the girls can\u2019t take it.\u201d Nunes will probably next fight the Jan. 28 winner of \u00a0No. 2-ranked Valentina Shevchenko, whom Nunes defeated by decision in March, vs. Julianna Pena. While Rousey\u2019s future is unclear, Nunes said she sought out the former champion\u00a0in the octagon after the stoppage and said, \u201cYou did a lot for the sport. Thank you so much. But now you can take time, rest and maybe do something else.\u201d In the news conference, Nunes said, \u201cWhy should she keep doing that, keep hurting herself? She should retire.\u201d ",

Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Juliet Eilperin and Adam Entous December 31 at 11:50 AM Follow @eilperin A code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U.S. officials. While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a security matter, the discovery underscores the vulnerabilities of the nation\u2019s electrical grid. And it raises fears in the U.S. government that Russian government hackers are actively trying to penetrate the grid to carry out potential attacks. Officials in government and the utility industry regularly monitor the grid because it is highly computerized and any disruptions can have disastrous implications for the country\u2019s medical and emergency services. Burlington Electric said in a statement that the company detected a malware code used in the Grizzly Steppe operation in a laptop that was not connected to the organization\u2019s grid systems. The firm said it took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alert federal authorities. Friday night, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) called on federal officials \u201cto conduct a full and complete investigation of this incident and undertake remedies to ensure that this never happens again.\u201d \u201cVermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world\u2019s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality-of-life, economy, health, and safety,\u201d Shumlin said in a statement. \u201cThis episode should highlight the urgent need for our federal government to vigorously pursue and put an end to this sort of Russian meddling.\u201d Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said he was briefed on the attempts to penetrate the electric grid by Vermont State Police on Friday evening. \u201cThis is beyond hackers having electronic joy rides \u2014 this is now about trying to access utilities to potentially manipulate the grid and shut it down in the middle of winter,\u201d Leahy said in a statement. \u201cThat is a direct threat to Vermont and we do not take it lightly.\u201d Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said the attack shows how rampant Russian hacking is. \u201cIt\u2019s systemic, relentless, predatory,\u201d Welch said . \u201cThey will hack everywhere, even Vermont, in pursuit of opportunities to disrupt our country. We must remain vigilant, which is why I support President Obama\u2019s sanctions against Russia and its attacks on our country and what it stands for.\u201d American officials, including one senior administration official, said they are not yet sure what the intentions of the Russians might have been. The incursion may have been designed to disrupt the utility\u2019s operations or as a test to see whether they could penetrate a portion of the grid. Officials said that it is unclear when the code entered the Vermont utility\u2019s computer, and that an investigation will attempt to determine the timing and nature of the intrusion, as well as whether other utilities were similarly targeted. \u201cThe question remains: Are they in other systems and what was the intent?\u201d a U.S. official said. This week, officials from the Department of Homeland Security, FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence shared the Grizzly Steppe malware code with executives from 16 sectors nationwide, including the financial, utility and transportation industries, a senior administration official said. Vermont utility officials identified the code within their operations and reported it to federal officials Friday, the official said. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) The DHS and FBI also publicly posted information about the malware Thursday as part of a joint analysis report , saying that the Russian military and civilian services\u2019 activity \u201cis part of an ongoing campaign of cyber- enabled operations directed at the U.S. government and its citizens.\u201d Another senior administration official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, said in an email that \u201cby exposing Russian malware\u201d in the joint analysis report, \u201cthe administration sought to alert all network defenders in the United States and abroad to this malicious activity to better secure their networks and defend against Russian malicious cyber activity.\u201d According to the report by the FBI and DHS, the hackers involved in the Russian operation used fraudulent emails that tricked their recipients into revealing passwords. Russian hackers, U.S. intelligence agencies say, earlier obtained a raft of internal emails from the Democratic National Committee, which were later released by WikiLeaks during this year\u2019s presidential campaign. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned the veracity of U.S. intelligence pointing to Russia\u2019s responsibility for hacks in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election. He also has spoken highly of Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite President Obama\u2019s suggestion that the approval for hacking came from the highest levels of the Kremlin. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said it would be \u201chighly inappropriate to comment\u201d on the incident given the fact that Spicer has not been briefed by federal authorities at this point. Obama has been criticized by lawmakers from both parties for not retaliating against Russia before the election. But officials said the president was concerned that U.S. countermeasures could prompt a wider effort by Moscow to disrupt the counting of votes on Election Day, potentially leading to a wider conflict. Officials said Obama also was concerned that taking retaliatory action before the election would be perceived as an effort to help the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. On Thursday, when Obama announced new economic measures against Russia and the expulsion of 35 Russian officials from the United States in retaliation for what he said was a deliberate attempt to interfere with the election, Trump told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.\u201d Trump has agreed to meet with U.S. intelligence officials next week to discuss allegations surrounding Russia\u2019s online activity. Russia has been accused in the past of launching a cyberattack on Ukraine\u2019s electrical grid, something it has denied. Cybersecurity experts say a hack in December 2015 destabilized Kiev\u2019s power grid, causing a blackout in part of the Ukrainian capital. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Petro \u00adPoroshenko accused Russia of waging a hacking war on his country that has entailed 6,500 attacks against Ukrainian state institutions over the past two months. Since at least 2009, U.S. authorities have tracked efforts by China, Russia and other countries to implant malicious software inside computers used by U.S. utilities. It is unclear if the code used in those earlier attacks was similar to what was found in the Vermont case. In November 2014, for example, federal authorities reported that a Russian malware known as BlackEnergy had been detected in the software controlling electric turbines in the United States. The Russian Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for the Energy Department and DHS declined to comment Friday. Editor\u2019s Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid. Authorities say there is no indication of that so far. The computer at Burlington Electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid. [] Alice Crites, Carol Morello and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report. Read more: ",

President-elect Donald Trump, however, couldn't let this year go without taking another dig at his critics. \"Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!\" he tweeted Saturday morning. Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2016 Trump's 2016 was capped by his presidential win in November, but he has feuded repeatedly with Democrats, members of his own Republican Party, celebrities and the media. His praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday continued to rankle his detractors, who support sanctions against Russia for allegedly interfering in the U.S. election .

Russia has been tied to the hacking scandal against the U.S., and remains deeply involved in the Syrian civil war. \"It wasn't easy, but the hardships that we have faced have brought us together, have motivated us to open huge reserves of our potential to move forward,\" Putin said. \"The main thing is that we believe in ourselves, in our strength, in our country.\" President Barack Obama used his final New Year's message to America to look back at his administration's accomplishments for the past eight years, touting Obamacare, the killing of Osama bin Laden and restoring ties with Cuba as gains. \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) December 31, 2016 German leader Angela Merkel, who faces a tough re-election campaign in 2017, said this past year was one in which the world \"turned upside down.\" In her New Year's speech to Germans, she cited Islamist terrorism as the nation's biggest challenge following a deadly truck attack at a Christmas market in Berlin. Earlier this year, the decision by Britain to leave the European Union still weighs heavily on Merkel's mind, she added. \"And, yes, Europe should focus on what can really be better than the national state,\" she said. \"But we Germans should never be led to believe that each could have a better future by going it alone.\" Related: New Year's Eve Celebrations Begin With Sydney Tribute to Fallen Icons Outgoing French President Francois Hollande used his address to rail against the increase of nationalism that espouses anti-immigration and anti-European viewpoints. \"How can we imagine our country being curled up behind walls, reduced to its internal market, going back to its national currency and, on top of that, discriminating between its own children according to their origins?\" he asked on French television. Elsewhere in the world, leaders tried to instill hope following social, political and economic upheaval. Brash Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte brushed aside criticism of his handling of the local drug war and questions about human rights violations by telling his people to be more positive in 2017. \"I hope that we will all enjoy the time of the year by demonstrating love, solidarity, understanding, happiness and optimism towards our personal ambitions and national aspirations,\" he said in a message.

USA TODAY Sports Duke Blue Devils guard Grayson Allen looks on prior to the game against the Virginia Tech Hokies at Cassell Coliseum. (Photo: Michael Thomas Shroyer, USA TODAY Sports) Following Duke's 89-75 upset loss to Virginia Tech , coach Mike\u00a0Krzyzewski didn't reveal any update on suspended guard Grayson Allen's status. But he did say Allen, in street clothes for Saturday's game in Blacksburg, Va., could be partially blamed for the loss and that the preseason All-American had been stripped of his duties as a captain for the Blue Devils based on the actions that got him suspended. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t want to talk about Grayson,\u201d Krzyzewski told news reporters. \u201cHe was part of the loss today by not being there. Instead of tri-captains, we\u2019ve eliminated him from being a captain of the team. Only Amile (Jefferson) and Matt (Jones) are doing that. It\u2019s unfortunate for any team to have interruptions. Sometimes you have no control of them, like an injury or sickness. Then sometimes something like this happens. We\u2019ve had a lot of interruptions. We have to stop having interruptions.\u201d Virginia Tech knocks off No. 5 Duke in ACC opener Allen has been indefinitely suspended since Duke's 72-61 victory against Elon (Dec. 21) for tripping Steven Santa Ana. It was the third time Allen had tripped a player, dating back to last season. \"We've played without a lot of people throughout the year. You'd rather have your full complement of players. That's not an excuse,\"\u00a0Krzyzewski said. \"(Allen) should be on the floor if he does the right things, and he didn't do the right thing, so he wasn't on the floor. That's the way it is.\" Duke faces Georgia Tech and Boston College at home next week. COLLEGE BASKETBALL HIGHLIGHTS Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

John McCain, R-Ariz., is shown in a photo  released by the Ukrainian Presidential press service meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in the Donetsk region. on Dec. 31, 2016. (Photo: Mikhail Palinchak, AFP/Getty Images,  Ukrainian Presi. Press Service,) Sen. John\u00a0McCain, who has emerged as the chief opponent within the Republican\u00a0party to Donald Trump's warming relations\u00a0with Russian President Vladimir Putin, underscored\u00a0his tough stance Saturday by spending New Year's Eve at a forward combat outpost\u00a0with Ukrainian troops. The senator, accompanied\u00a0by fellow senators Lindsey Graham and Amy Klobuchar,\u00a0posted photos on Twitter of his meetings with Ukrainian marines in\u00a0the village of Shyrokine.\u00a0In one, he\u00a0is shown posing\u00a0with\u00a0troops in front of a Ukrainian flag. In another, he joins\u00a0a Ukrainian marine commander in examining a piece of a 125mm tank shell. \"We stand w/them in their fight against #Putin's aggression,\" McCain wrote\u00a0in one tweet. McCain, R-Ariz., Graham, R-S.C., and Klobuchar, D-Minn, are\u00a0members of the Senate Armed Services committee. They have been visiting countries bordering\u00a0Russia, particularly\u00a0NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as\u00a0Ukraine and Georgia, which was invaded by Russian troops in 2008. They also met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who was decked out in camouflage along with the Ukrainian troops. The visit to Ukraine is particularly\u00a0pointed since it was the Russian strong-arm annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and the cross-border\u00a0military support for anti-Ukrainian government forces in eastern Ukraine that reversed a thaw in U.S.-Russian relations and led to the imposition of economic sanctions by Washington and the European Union. McCain, along with Graham, has\u00a0also been at the\u00a0forefront in supporting new sanctions against Russia over the Obama administration's charge of\u00a0cyberattacks by Russian operators in the 2016 election, notably the Democratic National Committee and emails of Democratic party staff. The administration imposed sanctions on Russia and expelled\u00a035 Russian diplomats from the U.S. Spending #NewYearsEve w/ brave #Ukrainian Marines at a forward combat outpost - we stand w/ them in their fight against #Putin 's aggression pic.twitter.com/vkz0gdozVV \u2014 John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) December 31, 2016 \u201cThe retaliatory measures announced by the Obama Administration today are long overdue,\" the two Republican senators said. \"But ultimately, they are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy. We intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.\u201d The\u00a0tough stance has contrasted sharply with the expressed views\u00a0of President-elect Donald Trump. The Republican standard-bearer\u00a0responded to the initial hacking report by saying he would discuss the issue with intelligence leaders next week, but otherwise felt that \"(i)t\u2019s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.\" After Putin declined to expel any U.S. diplomats, in the usual\u00a0tit-for-tat diplomatic response,\u00a0Trump tweeted praise for the Russian leader's decision, saying:\u00a0\"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) \u2014 I always knew he was very smart!\" For their\u00a0part,\u00a0McCain, Graham and Klobuchar are calling for even tougher\u00a0measures against the Kremlin. They told RadioFreeEurope/Radio Liberty in an interview in Kiev on Thursday\u00a0that the U.S. will not strike a \"Faustian bargain\" with Putin, amid speculation Trump could scrap sanctions in a bid to improve ties with Moscow. McCain, who has scheduled hearings on cyberattacks next week as chairman of the Armed Services Committee,\u00a0said any possible deal with Putin \"would interfere with and undermine the freedom and democracies that exist today.\" Graham said Congress would\u00a0target\u00a0the Russian energy and banking sectors with more sanctions, as well as \"Putin and his inner circle.\" \"We're going to do two things: We're going after Putin harder with tougher sanctions and we're going to be more helpful to our friends, like here in Ukraine,\" Graham said in the interview. As for Trump's skepticism over Russia's role in the purported hacking, Graham told RFE/RL:\u00a0\"If you have a hard time figuring out who is behind this, that doesn't speak well of you. The Russians are doing it all over the world.\" 6653 CONNECT TWEET 14 LINKEDIN 122 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iQjbtS NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "By Terrence McCoy December 31 at 8:17 PM Follow @terrence_mccoy FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. \u2014 They hadn\u2019t seen each other since the day one attacked the other, and now it was nine months later, and they were approaching a county courthouse to face each other for the second time in their lives. First came John Franklin McGraw, 79, who goes by \u201cQuick Draw McGraw\u201d and spends his days in a cowboy hat and leather boots with two-inch heels \u00adbecause, he says, \u201ca cowboy can\u2019t be 5-foot-8.\u201d Then came Rakeem Lamar Jones, 27, a man in skinny jeans who has long dreadlocks and tattoos up and down his arms. McGraw sat in the front row, and Jones found an open seat in the back. The last time they saw each other, McGraw was elbowing Jones in the face at a Donald Trump rally, one of the first moments of violence in what would become a historically contentious presidential campaign. After Jones was pulled up from the ground by county sheriffs and escorted out of the coliseum and the rally was over, McGraw went even further. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ISIS. We don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next time we see him, we might have to kill him.\u201d But it was another thing he said that both men have also been thinking about since that day: \u201cWe know he\u2019s not acting like an American.\u201d Nine months later, with so many things settled \u2014 the rallies done, the election over, Trump the winner \u2014 one of the questions that remained in their minds was what it means to be an American. McGraw voted for Trump. Jones voted for Hillary Clinton. McGraw is white. Jones is black. If they have anything in common, it\u2019s that both live in the same place, but Fayetteville is an increasingly polarized city in a polarized state in a polarized country, and they live in different parts. Now, hoping this hearing would perhaps bring some clarity, they wait for it to begin. Rakeem Jones, 27, sits outside his home in Fayetteville, N.C. After he was elbowed in the face at Donald Trump\u2019s rally, Jones quit his job because the company\u2019s name was published and found a new job in a different part of town delivering pizzas. (Liz Condo/For The Washington Post) Five days before the hearing, Jones was cradling a phone against his ear and typing another pizza order into a computer. \u201cRakeem!\u201d his manager yelled as two pizzas were slid into a carry case and placed beside him at the front counter. \u201cYou\u2019re out!\u201d Working the counter, he makes $7.35 an hour. On deliveries, it goes down to $4.25 an hour, but there\u2019s always the chance for a big tip, and he hustled the pizzas to a faded Mitsubishi sedan with a cracked windshield. He\u2019d bought it earlier in 2016 for $1,600 \u2014 most of his savings \u2014 when McGraw\u2019s attack at the Trump rally left him feeling unsafe riding the city bus. What if McGraw was serious about killing him? Considering the way the election had gone, what if a white-supremacist group decided to try something? Where he comes from, a rough neighborhood in northwest Fayetteville, threats are sometimes carried out. A few of his friends were murdered when he was younger, and two years before, someone shot up his aunt\u2019s trailer, killing his 3-year-old cousin sleeping inside. So in the days after the rally, he quit his job after the company\u2019s name was published, stopped taking the bus, bought a car and found a new job in a different part of town delivering pizzas. He put on a rap song and turned it up. He passed a neighborhood \u2014 tall pines, wide lawns and two-story brick houses \u2014 that characterizes one part of Fayetteville, a city that is 42\u00a0percent black and 46\u00a0percent white and anchors a county that went 56\u00a0percent for Clinton and 40\u00a0percent for Trump. The part he has lived in is mostly trailer parks and corner stores, and if he can ever make enough money at the pizza shop, he\u2019d like to live in a neighborhood like this one, even though he has come to see it as Donald Trump\u2019s America, an America where more and more he feels as if he doesn\u2019t belong. He pulled into a gated complex, got out with the pizzas and saw a large red truck with plates that said: \u201cKill \u2019em all. Let God sort \u2019em out.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Fayetteville,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mentality.\u201d There was a time when he thought differently, not just about Fayetteville but about America as well. He knew there were racists in his country and community, but he also trusted that its people were tolerant of diversity and wouldn\u2019t vilify someone who went to a Trump rally and yelled out some words of protest. But since that night, he has thought about race constantly. He has thought about it when he has delivered pizzas to houses with Trump yard signs. He has thought about how he must look walking up to the door with his dreadlocks and tattoos, at times wondering whether he\u2019d be welcomed if he weren\u2019t holding a pizza. A pizza now extended in front of him, he knocked on a second-floor door, and when a woman and a small boy answered, he smiled. \u201cHow you doing, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked, then looked at the child. \u201cHow you doing little man? You hungry?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re starving,\u201d the woman said. He handed the pizzas to the boy \u2014 \u201cBe careful with that. It\u2019s hot.\u201d \u2014 collected a $2 tip from the woman and walked to his car, feeling pleased. \u201cHey, it adds up at the end of the night,\u201d he said. He headed back to the shop, where he saw his next delivery was a large order of 15 pizzas. There had been a delay in getting the food ready for delivery, and when he grabbed the pizzas and hurried back out to his car, he knew he would be significantly late. In the car, he thought he recognized the address so he called ahead to make sure he was heading to the correct place. \u201cIs that a church?\u201d he asked into the phone. \u201cAll right, ma\u2019am. Yeah, I\u2019ve delivered to this place before.\u201d By the time he got there, the pizzas were 30 minutes late. Balancing all 15 of them against the wall with one hand, he opened the front door with the other and saw a children\u2019s party inside. He set the pizzas down on a counter as a man talking on a cellphone came up to him. \u201cI\u2019m on the phone with your manager right now. We need to talk over here,\u201d the man said, and Jones followed him into another room where they were alone. \u201cYou should have been here 30 minutes ago,\u201d he told Jones as the manager listened. \u201cI\u2019m not happy right now.\u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d Jones said, as the man said to the manager, \u201cHe called, I don\u2019t know, maybe 20 minutes ago, saying he was lost.\u201d \u201cI never said I was lost,\u201d Jones said quietly. \u201cYou were asking my wife where we were.\u201d \u201cI was making sure it was this church.\u201d \u201cThat makes me feel like you were lost,\u201d he said. Jones looked straight ahead and was silent as the man spoke again to the manager. \u201cWe were planning on giving him a nice large tip, but based on the situation that we got going on here, we\u2019re just going to pay for the pizza,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m saying all of this in front of him.\u201d He hung up and gave Jones $100. The bill for the pizza was $98. Jones put the money in his pocket as the man pointed at the back door. \u201cExit out this door out here,\u201d he said. Another $2 tip. He started back to the pizza shop. \u201cThat\u2019s my America,\u201d Jones said. John McGraw, 79, who worked as a ranch hand and horse trainer in Texas, now makes leather belts, leather wristbands and gun holsters that he sells at gun shows and flea markets. (Liz Condo/For The Washington Post) Three days before the hearing, John McGraw was waiting for his attorney to call to talk about what could happen in court. \u201cHe told me he\u2019d call today,\u201d McGraw said. He sat alone in his workshop down a dirt road just outside Fayetteville and glanced at a sheet of paper where he had written all he was going to be doing that day: \u201c1) 38 39 Belt, Jim\u201d \u201c2) Wrist Band (Evans)\u201d \u201c3) Son\u2019s Belt 33 1/4\u201d This is how McGraw earns income beyond his Social Security checks, making leather belts, leather wristbands and gun holsters that he sells at gun shows and flea markets. He looked around the cramped shop, which contained nearly everything he owned. A pile of unfinished leather strips. A collection of nine black powder rifles, replicas of the sort used in the Revolutionary and Civil wars. A miniature Confederate flag and a sign that says: \u201cYou can\u2019t have my country. You can\u2019t have my guns. And I don\u2019t want your handouts.\u201d He spends most of his days in this shop and his nights sleeping in a small trailer parked just outside, the latest phase in a life in which he married and divorced three times, had children he hasn\u2019t seen in 30 years, worked as a ranch hand and horse trainer in Texas, sold leather work and was now living alone, rarely greeting guests beyond a neighbor\u2019s dog that sometimes comes by. Out came two strips of belt leather. He settled each onto his workbench and rubbed beeswax into them until they darkened and turned shiny. \u201cOther belts aren\u2019t done like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not hand-rubbed. But when I make a belt, it\u2019s made for life.\u201d At times he has looked at the belts that some people wear, noticing the cheap buckles, the fraying ends, the fake leather, and wondered how someone could buy a belt like that. And lately, it has not just been that question, but a lot of questions he has been having about the changes in the country. Gay marriage. How is that now legal? Baltimore and Ferguson. How could people burn down those buildings and shut down the roads? A Trump rally. How could someone think it was okay to shout obscenities and boo a man running for \u00adpresident? Decency. What happened to decency? And on the night of March 9, when he saw Jones shouting at Trump and others, he got up from his chair as Jones was passing, threw an elbow, and now he was regretting it not only because he was arrested the next day, but because the other person acting indecently was him. He looked at his flip phone, saw he hadn\u2019t missed any calls from his attorney, and finished the first belt. Why, he has often asked himself, did he act the way he did? How could he have suspected Jones was a terrorist? He had never considered himself a bigot or a hateful person \u2014 far from it \u2014 and now, thinking about what happened, as he does every day, he clenched his jaw and shook his head. He said he had never been so humiliated in his life. All the newspaper articles, television clips and political ads suggesting he was a racist. But sometimes he felt he was the one who was actually the victim of racism. This wouldn\u2019t have been news, he thought, if Jones had been white or he had been black. His case wouldn\u2019t have dragged on for nine months. He wouldn\u2019t have been kicked out of his fast-draw shooting club because he didn\u2019t reflect its values. People wouldn\u2019t be baiting him into racial arguments at the flea market. He finished the second belt, placed it in a plastic bag and zipped it closed. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m too defensive. Maybe I\u2019ve lived too long,\u201d he said. \u201cYears back, maybe I should have just been put down like a trained dog you can\u2019t have in public.\u201d Since the rally, a friend of his named Ed Hood had tried many times to talk to McGraw about his defensiveness. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this since March,\u201d Hood told him one time when McGraw was again talking about why he had elbowed Jones. \u201cThere\u2019s somebody with an attitude that can make you angry enough that you might want to fight them. But don\u2019t do it. You got to let the talk go by you.\u201d \u201cEddie, I had a fear of what might happen next,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what would mushroom. I didn\u2019t know where it would go.\u201d \u201cYeah, that was your interpretation,\u201d Hood said. \u201cIf I had run into Jones on the street, I would have said, \u2018Go on home, boy, before you get yourself hurt.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t have hit him,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cBut under the circumstances.\u201d \u201cThat public behavior is disappointing to you?\u201d \u201cYes, it is.\u201d \u201cThat people don\u2019t act more orderly?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. . . . It was a situation way beyond decency.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a misunderstanding is what it is.\u201d He now picked up the next thing on his to-do list, a leather band. He etched the name \u201cEvans\u201d into it and carved an intricate pattern. He painted the border in a rich red and put down his brush. \u201cThat\u2019s a right cute little wristband,\u201d he said. He looked at his phone again. His attorney still hadn\u2019t called. He looked at his list. All done. He looked at the clock. His day still had six more hours to go. John McGraw carves a design into a custom leather holster in his workshop in North Carolina. He spends most of his days in this shop and his nights sleeping in a small trailer parked just outside. (Liz Condo/For The Washington Post) On the day of the court hearing, Jones and McGraw drove through a town that in the nine months since the Trump rally has found little public agreement over who was ultimately the true victim that night. They walked into a courtroom that was already filling with dozens of people \u2014 some black, some white, some supporters of McGraw, others Jones. McGraw took off his cowboy hat and leather jacket, and as he was sitting in the first row, a man in a suit in front of the bench said \u201cQuick Draw McGraw!\u201d People around him began to laugh, and a bailiff said \u201cQuick Draw!\u201d and McGraw shifted in his seat and didn\u2019t say anything. Jones took an open spot in the back, and neither one reacted to the other until the judge called the case. Jones stood, walked to the prosecutor\u2019s table and clasped his hands behind his back. McGraw stood a few feet away at the defendant\u2019s table. He was facing two misdemeanor charges of assault and battery and disorderly conduct. McGraw looked ashen and a little dazed, and when the judge asked how he would plead, his attorney said no contest as McGraw lowered his gaze. \u201cDoes the victim wish to be heard?\u201d the judge asked Jones. Jones, who had yet to look at McGraw, thought for moment. \u201cFrom the beginning, it even took place in front of the sheriffs, the way it was handled wasn\u2019t right. He was allowed to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cI know he is not going to receive jail time, but at the same time I have a friend who is facing five years for what was, at the root of it, a fight. I just don\u2019t understand that. I don\u2019t agree.\u201d McGraw, who had looked at Jones the entire time he spoke, now glanced at the judge, who asked McGraw\u2019s attorney whether he had anything to say. \u201cIt needs to be stated by my client through me that Mr. McGraw\u2019s actions were not racially motivated,\u201d the lawyer said. McGraw shook his head. People in the audience began to chuckle and smirk at one another. \u201cHe wants the country and the United States to know it had nothing to do with race,\u201d he continued, \u201cand that this country needs to heal as it relates to racial tensions that have been generated as a result of this case.\u201d Jones listened and asked whether he could say more. \u201cNot one time throughout this whole six months have I mentioned race,\u201d he said. The crowd went silent. \u201cAs far as race, it\u2019s not my concern. I got hit by a man, period.\u201d The judge asked McGraw whether he wanted to say something, too. \u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry this happened,\u201d McGraw said, and when the judge told him to explain it to Jones, not him, he turned to Jones and took a step toward him. It was the closest they\u2019d been to each other since the rally. \u201cThis was between two men. You know what you did. And I know what I did. I\u2019m not going to say you were wrong or I was wrong,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cYou and I both know what occurred, and I hate it worse than anything else in the world.\u201d He stepped closer to Jones and raised a finger. \u201cWe got caught up in a political mess today,\u201d he said. His jaw began to tremble. \u201cAnd you and me, we got to heal our country.\u201d \u201cAll right, man,\u201d Jones said after a moment. He reached out to pat McGraw on the shoulder, and he seemed surprised by the contact. He put out his hand. Jones grasped it, and, as a few claps in the audience grew into an applause, the two men embraced. The sentence McGraw received was one year probation, and after the judge was done and the case was over, McGraw had one more thing to say to Jones. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stick together,\u201d he quietly told Jones. \u201cWe can\u2019t let them come between us.\u201d Then he walked toward a side exit and put on his cowboy hat, and Jones went in another direction, toward a friend who had been with him the night of the rally. \u201cIt was a slap in the face, man,\u201d the friend, Ronnie Rouse, told Jones. \u201cWhat messed me up here was the guy didn\u2019t apologize.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Jones said and nodded his head. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cIf it was me? Ninety days, five-year probation, $1,000 fine. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d Rouse said, and a few minutes later, standing outside with Jones, he looked back at the courthouse. \u201cHe really believes in how he acted. He\u2019s just a stubborn old man.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s real life,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhat you see is what you get.\u201d What he got when he returned to the trailer park that day were outraged messages and online comments. As news spread, more people started calling him a sellout for forgiving McGraw. They told him he was wrong to shake his hand, that he was wrong to hug him. But he had spent nine months thinking about McGraw and the Trump rally and believed, with the election weeks past, it was time to let it go. So when McGraw, now in his own trailer, unexpectedly phoned him the next day to see how he was doing and to thank him for his decency, Jones listened awhile and told him he appreciated the call. Rakeem Jones, right, shakes hands with John McGraw and pats his back during their hearing at the Cumberland County courthouse in Fayetteville, N.C. McGraw pleaded no contest to charges that he assaulted Jones at a Donald Trump rally in March.

    "text": "Indeed, Rousey\u2019s future in the sport is clearly in question. The biggest star in the women\u2019s game, who left the arena without giving an interview, is likely considering retirement shortly before her 30th birthday. \u201cThat\u2019s it for her,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cFor sure, she\u2019s going to retire.\u201d Referee Herb Dean stopped the bout with Rousey still on her feet, and Rousey briefly protested the stoppage before leaving the cage in her mother\u2019s arms. Nunes put her finger to her lips and circled the cage after the stoppage, pausing to taunt Rousey\u2019s much-maligned coach, Edmond Tarverdyan. \u201cHer coach put some crazy things in her head, and her career started going down,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cI\u2019m the real striker here.\u201d Ronda Rousey: \"I want to build something that survives me\" Cody Garbrandt won the men\u2019s bantamweight title in the penultimate bout at UFC 207, battering champion Dominick Cruz to earn a surprising decision victory at T-Mobile Arena in the promotion\u2019s traditional end-of-the-year show in its hometown. But the sellout crowd left shocked when Rousey couldn\u2019t compete in her first fight since losing her belt to Holly Holm 13 months ago in her first career defeat. Rousey became arguably the world\u2019s most famous female athlete and a combat sports trailblazer while she rocketed atop the UFC, but a year away from the sport apparently did little to heal the holes in her game. She made a guaranteed $3 million for her comeback bout, while Nunes\u2019 guaranteed payday was just $200,000. \u201cI knew I was going to beat (Rousey),\u201d Nunes said. \u201cI\u2019m the best on the planet.\u201d Ronda Rousey: Stereotypes about women in MMA are \"upside down\" Rousey hadn\u2019t fought since November 2015, when Holm stopped her with a head kick in one of the biggest upsets in MMA history. Rousey had never lost or been in much trouble while the former Olympic judo medalist earned a series of one-sided victories, but Holm\u2019s veteran striking made Rousey look unprepared. Rousey\u2019s return fight was similar, but even quicker. Nunes claimed the belt at UFC 200 in July with a violent stoppage of Miesha Tate, who had beaten Holm in March. Nunes made an impressive ascent after losing three fights earlier in her career to opponents beaten easily by Rousey. Rousey nearly vanished from public view after her first loss, taking time away from the gym and attending to her acting career. The UFC also was sold during her absence to WME-IMG, the entertainment conglomerate that also represents Rousey\u2019s career. UFC fighter Ronda Rousey on weight and feeling sexy But Rousey refused to promote this pay-per-view show, leaving Cruz, Garbrandt and Nunes to do most of the work. While Rousey\u2019s media blackout will hurt her cut of the pay-per-view revenue, it didn\u2019t affect her guaranteed payday, which matched Conor McGregor for the biggest disclosed check in UFC history. Earlier, Garbrandt (11-0) remained unbeaten with a virtuoso performance to claim the belt held for the past 11 months by Cruz (22-2), who ended up with a gaping cut over his left eye. Garbrandt used precise striking, multiple takedowns and remarkable charisma to win over the judges, who all favored him by scores of 48-46, 48-46 and 48-47. Cruz hadn\u2019t lost an MMA fight since March 24, 2007, winning 13 straight bouts in a career marked by multiple comebacks from major injuries. The 25-year-old Garbrandt is a native of Uhrichsville, Ohio, who trains in the Sacramento-area gym of veteran fighter Urijah Faber. Cruz and Garbrandt taunted each other repeatedly during the promotion of their bout, and their genuine dislike translated into a frenzied five-round fight. Garbrandt lived up to his boundless promise with a resourceful effort against Cruz, who was favored to defend his belt. \u201cIf you don\u2019t lose, you don\u2019t grow,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe\u2019re all competitors here, and it\u2019s a game of inches. He beat me by a couple of inches tonight, and that\u2019s OK. ... There wasn\u2019t one second of this fight I wasn\u2019t trying to win. I chased him around the cage the whole night.\u201d While Cruz threw 100 more strikes, Garbrandt landed a higher percentage of his shots and did more damage. Both fighters landed significant strikes in the first two rounds, but Garbrandt turned the fight in his favor early in the third during the exchange that opened the cut on Cruz\u2019s face. Garbrandt put on a performance in the fourth round, repeatedly knocking down Cruz when he wasn\u2019t dancing away from the champion. After receiving his belt, Garbrandt wrapped it around the waist of Maddux Maple, a 10-year-old leukemia survivor from northern Ohio who has been his motivational talisman. Garbrandt\u2019s first title defense could be against T.J. Dillashaw, who dominated John Lineker in a unanimous-decision victory moments earlier at UFC 207, winning 30-26 on all three cards. Dillashaw (15-3) showed off precise striking and a superior ground game to trounce the Brazilian brawler. \u201cCome try me!\u201d Garbrandt shouted at Dillashaw afterward. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Image Gallant's beautiful debut album \u201cOlogy\u201d is rooted in 1980s-inflected experimentation. CreditMike Windle/Getty Images for Coachella Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week\u2019s most notable new songs and videos \u2014 and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. You can listen to this playlist on Spotify here . Like this Playlist? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com , and sign up for our Louder newsletter (coming soon!) here . Noname, \u2018Yesterday\u2019 Interactive Fatimah Warner, who records as Noname, starts her mixtape \u201cTelefone\u201d with \u201cYesterday,\u201d a song about her grandmother\u2019s funeral and a lot more : celebrity, memories, insubordination, self-doubt, nostalgia, gratitude. Noname is from Chicago and has appeared on tracks by Chance the Rapper; her delivery is all her own. She\u2019s sometimes rhythmic, sometimes spoken-word conversational, sometimes sung and always calmly assured. The smooth backup track of \u201cYesterday\u201d hints at Stevie Wonder and gospel-R&B;, with twinkly electric piano and a hip-hop backbeat, but her vocal comes at it from every angle, cannily destabilizing it to make herself heard. JON PARELES Roberto Fonseca, \u2018Family\u2019 Interactive The Cuban pianist Roberto Fonseca's 2016 album, \"ABUC,\" put vintage Cuban styles through assorted time warps. \"Family,\" with its genre billed as \"Doo-wop/Electro Arag\u00f3n,\u201d is the nuttiest of them. Mr. Fonseca takes frisky solos on organ, and the tune layers the kind of rock that might have shown up in a mid-1960s TV theme with a raucous New Orleans horn section, vocals from members of the Cuban institution Orquesta Arag\u00f3n a bridge that down-shifts into a slow cha-cha and a street-parade coda. It ends up somewhere between Santana and Buena Vista Social Club, and a long way from tradition. A live version on YouTube is fun, too. J.P. Bayonne, \u2018Appeals\u2019 Everything loops and tinkles in \u201cAppeals\u201d by Roger Sellers, a.k.a. Bayonne, a one-man band \u2014 not only in the studio but also live \u2014 who assembles dizzying pop songs that all segue together on his album, \u201cPrimitives.\u201d He\u2019s clearly a disciple of pioneering tape-loop Minimalists like Terry Riley and Steve Reich using far more modern gear. And he\u2019s probably well aware of Animal Collective; he exults in percussive, hypnotic consonance. Like much of the album, \u201cAppeals\u201d is full of sounds that plink and ping \u2014 pianos and bell tones, high and low \u2014 and vocals stacked into dazed mantras over rock drums and guitars. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine how it made you feel/nothing is real and nothing appeals,\u201d he sings. Is it the isolation of the self-sufficient music geek? J.P. Charly Black, \u2018Gyal You a Party Animal\u2019 A prototypical dancehall reggae slow-burner. First released in 2014, this song, a peppy celebration of a girl who can \u201cflip it like a Flipagram,\u201d became one of this year\u2019s most uplifting and cheerful anthems. It\u2019s uncommonly smooth \u2014 the beat is the Jambe-An riddim (produced by DJ Kurt Riley) \u2014 and found wide acceptance, whether on the New York hip-hop station Hot 97, or in the world of reggaeton, where artists including Maluma , Daddy Yankee and Farruko made remixes. JON CARAMANICA DJ Luke Nasty, \u2018Might Be\u2019 Anderson.Paak released \u201cMight Be\u201d in 2015 \u2014 it was gentle, lush, a careful whisper. It received a little notice, but not much. This year, DJ Luke Nasty did something between a cover and a remix of it, remaking the song as a steroidal come-on, amping up the drums and the bawdiness. It went to No. 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. Glean from that what you will. J.C. DJ Q, \u2018Sonic\u2019 A blistering yet bubbly grime instrumental built out of Sonic the Hedgehog sound effects. Clever and inevitable and a refreshing shock. J.C. William Michael Morgan, \u2018I Know Who He Is\u2019 Interactive In the emergent field of gentleman country \u2014 an antidote to the bros of the last few years \u2014 William Michael Morgan stands tall, with good posture and a modest mien. This song is one of the best from his sturdy, reflective debut album, \u201cVinyl.\u201d It\u2019s a throwback to the temperate wisdom of midcareer George Strait, and a needed breather after all the pickup trucks break down and all the lakeside parties get broken up. J.C. Gallant, \u2018Bourbon\u2019 A sterling modern quiet-storm anthem with mystic lyrics: \u201cI'm a headless horseman on quilted sand dunes/With my neck wide open, I pray for refuge.\u201d This is the most bracing song on Gallant\u2019s beautiful debut album \u201cOlogy,\u201d a collection of spacious R&B; rooted in 1980s-inflected experimentation. J.C. Elysia Crampton feat. Chino Amobi, \u2018Children of Hell\u2019 Interactive The most provocative and unstable songs on Elysia Crampton\u2019s \u201cElysia Crampton Presents: Demon City\u201d are with Chino Amobi, especially \u201cChildren of Hell,\u201d a jumble of gothic doom, soul whimsy, and industrial crunch that sounds like it\u2019s at war with itself, with several rhythmic ideas shouting over each other to be heard. J.C. Jim Black Trio, \u2018Song H\u2019 Interactive The drummer and composer Jim Black is known for hair-trigger volatility, but in his smart acoustic trio, with Elias Stemeseder on piano and Thomas Morgan on bass, he also finds cause for deep sonority and rustling reflection. Last spring the band rolled into Le Poisson Rouge to provide a tantalizing preview of its third album , \u201cThe Constant,\u201d which was released in August. The album deserved more attention than it has received: it appeared on hardly any year-end lists, which seems in retrospect like an oversight. For a picture of the album in brief, hear \u201cSong H,\u201d which compresses a lot into a five-minute track: a prickly prepared-piano line, a mournful near-chorale, a resonant bass solo. And a groove that dissolves and hardens again. NATE CHINEN Wolfgang Muthspiel Quintet, \u2018Father and Sun\u2019 Wolfgang Muthspiel, an Austrian guitarist with a graceful and lyrical style, put together a legitimate all-star team for his new album, \u201cRising Grace.\u201d Along with the unsurpassable rhythm team of Larry Grenadier on bass and Brian Blade on drums, which he has enlisted before, he brought in the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire and the pianist Brad Mehldau. The album errs a bit on the side of shadowy beauty \u2014 it\u2019s an ECM release, and seems to take that fact seriously \u2014 but there\u2019s a spark in this band that should be sustained. Judge for yourself with this video, a live performance of one of the album\u2019s best tracks, \u201cFather and Sun.\u201d N. Catherine Russell, \u2018You\u2019ve Got the Right Key But the Wrong Keyhole\u2019 Interactive Jazz Age revivalism has many shining stewards, but no one more to-the-manner-born than Catherine Russell. That\u2019s an actual fact: Ms. Russell\u2019s parents, Luis Russell and Carline Ray, were notable figures in jazz during the 1930s and \u201940s. Her own career has hardly followed a straight line \u2014 she has toured with David Bowie, and provided background vocals to dozens of other pop acts \u2014 but she can give the impression of having sung throwback standards, without distraction, for all her life. \u201cHarlem on My Mind\u201d is her latest album, and it transcends any novelty airs even on a song like \u201cYou\u2019ve Got the Right Key But the Wrong Keyhole,\u201d about which no more need be said. N.C. Justin Carter, \u2018Know It All\u2019 If you know Justin Carter, you probably know him as a D.J., one-half of the Brooklyn dance label and party host Mister Saturday Night. \u201cThe Leaves Fall,\u201d a forthcoming solo album, reveals another side of Mr. Carter, as a singer-songwriter enamored of chiming British psych-folk. \u201cKnow It All\u201d is the album\u2019s lead single, released digitally and as a seven-inch single. It features pizzicato cello and a subtle growl of organ, along with lyrics that revel in comeuppance. Catch up with the song, which was released a few months ago, and you\u2019ll also have a leg up on the album, due out on Jan. 27. N.C. The Cookers, \u2018The Call of the Wild and Peaceful Heart\u2019 Hard bop has no greater present-day vessel than the Cookers, a collective of seasoned travelers in the style, like the pianist George Cables and the drummer Billy Hart. The band, which is closing in on a decade of work, released another strong and searching album this year, \u201cThe Call of the Wild and Peaceful Heart.\u201d The title track was composed by Billy Harper, who originally released it just over 40 years ago. But there\u2019s nothing dated about its sound here, especially as Mr. Harper tears into a tenor saxophone solo, around the five-minute mark. N.C. And for good measure, seven more thumpers ",

Watt AJ Mast / Associated Press Penn State running back Saquon Barkley (26) makes a 18-yard touchdown catch against Wisconsin's T.J. Watt (42) during the second half of the Big Ten championship game. Penn State running back Saquon Barkley (26) makes a 18-yard touchdown catch against Wisconsin's T.J. Watt (42) during the second half of the Big Ten championship game. (AJ Mast / Associated Press) Zach Helfand Monday\u2019s Rose Bowl will be as it almost always has been. Parade goers will settle in to watch a Pac-12 Conference team play one from the Big Ten Conference. There will be, as usual, an efficient offense behind a line of prodigious size. The other team will offer a familiar contrast, a speedy spread capable of shredding a defense on one big play. The only difference is which team is which. \u201cI don't think it's the proverbial slow Big Ten versus fast Pac-12 matchup,\u201d USC offensive coordinator Tee Martin said. \u201cThese guys are very athletic, they're fast, they have size.\u201d USC and Penn State have flipped the Rose Bowl archetypes. Penn State abandoned three yards and a cloud of dust for great big chunks of yardage, run out of an up-tempo, no-huddle offense. \u201cYou'd think they were a Pac-12 team,\u201d linebacker Michael Hutchings said. \u201cJust with a little bit more explosion, honestly.\u201d Penn State's offense ranked fifth nationally in explosiveness, according to footballstudyball.com. It ranked only\u00a082nd in efficiency. The dynamic was flipped for the Trojans, who still have the athletes that have come to define their program but whose offensive footprint veers closer to the typical Big Ten style: methodical, balanced and efficient. USC ranked only\u00a084th in explosiveness, but 10th in efficiency. Linebacker Uchenna Nwosu compared Penn State\u2019s offense to last season\u2019s Oregon team, which scored 48 points against USC. But the familiarity, Coach Clay Helton said, is comforting. \u201cIt's something that we see on a weekly basis in the Pac-12,\u201d Helton said. \u201cIt gives you a little bit better sleep at night. The thing you're scared about is the amount of athletes that they have on the field.\u201d Much of Penn State\u2019s offensive regulars would not seem out of place on a\u00a0Pac-12 team. Quarterback Trace McSorley can be a dangerous runner. Running back Saquon Barkley, at 223 pounds,\u00a0ran the team\u2019s fastest 40-yard-dash time in the spring. Defensively, Penn State has had mixed results against speedier teams. Penn State cornerback John Reid said USC\u2019s offense was, \u201ca little bit of Ohio State , a little bit of Indiana.\u201d Indiana put up 31 points in a loss to Penn State. Ohio State managed only\u00a021 \u2014 half its season average \u2014 in Penn State\u2019s upset victory. ",

    "text": "Dec 31 2016, 7:21 pm ET Texas Judge Halts Federal Transgender Protections by The Associated Press advertisement AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 A federal judge in Texas has ordered a halt to another Obama administration effort to strengthen transgender rights, this time over health rules that social conservatives say could force doctors to violate their religious beliefs. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor on Saturday granted a temporary injunction that stops federal health officials from enforcing rules that are intended to ban discrimination by doctors and hospitals against transgender persons. O'Connor wrote in a 46-page ruling that the rules \"likely violate\" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. O'Connor is the same judge who sided with Republican-controlled states earlier this year over transgender protections in public schools sought by the Obama administration. That lawsuit centered on a federal directive requiring schools to let transgender students use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. The lawsuit in which O'Connor issued the injunction Saturday contends that the rules, which were finalized in May, could force doctors to help with gender transition contrary to their religious beliefs or medical judgment. Transgender rights advocates called that a far-fetched hypothetical, saying a person would not approach a doctor who lacked suitable experience and expertise. Joining Texas in the lawsuit were Wisconsin, Kentucky, Nebraska and Kansas, along with the Christian Medical and Dental Association and Franciscan Alliance, an Indiana-based network of religious hospitals. The Obama administration finalized the regulations around the time it issued its directive to public schools regarding transgender students. Thirteen states signed on to fight that directive, including three involved in the latest lawsuit, and won a temporary injunction in August from U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor.

    "text": "Can Congress put aside differences in the new year? The Senate plans to begin repealing Obama\u2019s health care law on Tuesday, Congress\u2019 very first day, with consideration of a procedural measure that will shield from Democratic filibusters legislation annulling much of that statute. Lawmakers will then spend the next few months working on legislation canceling broad swaths of the law. Likely to go are its mandate that people buy health insurance or face IRS fines, and its expansion of Medicaid coverage to more lower-earning Americans. Some elements of the repeal likely wouldn\u2019t go into effect for two to four years. Republicans will then begin the more complicated task of building a new system. The GOP will have to craft new programs for the nation\u2019s $3 trillion health care system and make sure insurance markets don\u2019t collapse while the transition is under way. --- TAX OVERHAUL Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, want a massive overhaul of the tax system with the goal of simplifying a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants as well as corporations that can easily shift profits and jobs overseas. It would be the first major tax overhaul in 30 years. Mr. Trump has also advocated a tax overhaul, but with fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all. --- SUPREME COURT Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died 11 months ago, but the Senate still hasn\u2019t considered a replacement. That\u2019s because McConnell blocked consideration of Obama\u2019s nominee , Judge Merrick Garland, saying the next president should make the pick. The strategy paid off, and the Republican Senate will consider whomever Mr. Trump nominates. --- MEDICARE CHANGES Ryan is the most powerful advocate in Washington for an overhaul of Medicare and a premium-support approach that would, over time, remake it into a voucher-like program that could force some seniors entering the program to buy health insurance on the open market instead of getting coverage through the traditional open-ended program. But his ideas likely will run into a political reality. Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail that he wouldn\u2019t cut the program, and Senate Republicans haven\u2019t been as enthusiastic either. Candidate Trump also initially promised not to cut Medicaid - the federal-state health insurance program for low-income and severely disabled people. During the campaign, Mr. Trump seemed to shift, backing \u201cblock grants\u201d that limit federal funding. --- ",

USA TODAY Sports Top-ranked Crimson Tide will play for second consecutive championship and fifth in eight years after dispatching Huskies Washington Huskies wide receiver John Ross (1) fumbles against the Alabama Crimson Tide during the first quarter in the 2016 CFP semifinal at the Peach Bowl at the Georgia Dome. (Photo: John David Mercer, USA TODAY Spor) ATLANTA \u2014\u00a0Breaking down No. 1 Alabama\u2019s 24-7\u00a0win over No. 4 Washington in Saturday\u2019s College Football Playoff national semifinal game at the Peach Bowl. THE BIG PICTURE: Alabama is exactly who we thought it was. The Crimson Tide defense was and is relentless, aggressive and quick, its offense inconsistent. But this team is so dominant defensively, offensive struggles \u2014 be it with play calling or penalties \u2014 tend not to ultimately affect the game\u2019s outcome. When the front seven applied pressure to Washington quarterback Jake Browning, it forced him to either keep the ball for minimal gains on scrambles, throw the ball away \u2014 or, worst yet \u2014 give the ball directly to the Alabama defense, which he did with his game-changing pick-six in the second quarter. Saturday\u2019s Peach Bowl was competitive for about a quarter, with Washington\u2019s creative yet methodical scoring drive giving the Huskies an early lead, and forcing Alabama true freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts to respond with a touchdown drive of his own, which he did in impressive fashion. But once Washington\u2019s offense began to sputter with three-and-outs over and over again, the game\u2019s outcome was never close to being in doubt, despite some head-scratching Alabama offensive play calling, and some poorly timed offensive penalties. Washington just couldn\u2019t muster any sort of offense that could lead to actual, tangible points. WHAT WE\u2019LL BE TALKING ABOUT: Alabama DL Jonathan Allen (93) celebrates with teammates after a tackle. \u00a0(Photo: Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports) Whether the winner of the Fiesta Bowl even has a shot against this Crimson Tide team. No offense to either Ohio State or Clemson, but after watching the beatdown that was the Peach Bowl, it\u2019s hard to imagine a team that can withstand the following well enough to win: \u25ba\u00a0The relentless nature of the Alabama front seven, whose physicality and speed are hard to fathom until you see it up close. That also means it\u2019s hard to simulate for opponents in practice ahead of time. \u25ba The ability for Nick Saban\u2019s defense to adjust almost instantaneously. When Washington found success with a rarely used screen play on its touchdown drive in the first quarter, Alabama immediately identified it and how to stop it on subsequent drives. Alabama running back Bo Scarbrough (9) had more rushing yards than Washington as a team. \u00a0(Photo: Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports) \u25ba\u00a0Bo Scarbrough, technically the backup tailback to Damien Harris, continues to add a different dimension to the Tide run game. And, well, it\u2019s a crazy good dimension. Scarbrough was the most dynamic\u00a0player on either offense all game,\u00a0accounting\u00a0for 180\u00a0yards on 19\u00a0carries for two\u00a0touchdowns. \u25ba\u00a0The wear-down factor. There\u2019s a reason\u00a0Scarbrough was able to break off his biggest run of the day in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s the same reason Browning and co. could barely sustain drives with positive yardage much of\u00a0the second half.\u00a0Alabama wears its opponents down and puts them away late. Fin. THE TURNING POINT: Trailing by just three late in the second quarter, on second and 10 from Washington\u2019s own 32-yard line, Browning threw an ill-advised pass \u2026 directly to Alabama linebacker Ryan Anderson, who snatched it and ran it into the end zone for a score. It was a huge momentum shift about 70 seconds before halftime, giving Alabama the double-digit lead it deserved to that point. THE HIGHLIGHT: Scarbrough\u2019s insane 68-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run. Seriously, you\u2019ve got to see this: \u2014 Dr. Saturday (@YahooDrSaturday) December 31, 2016 KEY STAT: Anderson\u2019s pick-six in the second quarter was the Crimson Tide\u2019s 11th defensive touchdown of the season. It also brings the total of non-offensive touchdowns up to 15 (!!). HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE PEACH BOWL: ALABAMA VS. WASHINGTON ",

    "text": "News Local news Breaking News Families of 2016 slain bear crosses down Magnificent Mile Over 700 crosses were erected and carried along Michigan Avenue on Dec. 31, 2016 \u2014\u00a0one for each person killed in 2016 in Chicago. Greg Zanis, of Aurora, constructed the crosses with the help of volunteers and distributed them to families of the victims. Marwa Eltagouri Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The crosses were heavy. Each one was about four feet tall, formed from two hefty wooden planks nailed together. A name was scribbled on each one. And an age. And a number. Like Madison Watson, 4 years old, No. 456. Or Donald Carter Brunson, 28 years old, No. 522. Each cross was for one of the more than 750 homicide victims in Chicago in 2016. They were numbered to represent where the death fell on the year's homicide count. No. 1, for example, was the cross for Deandre Holiday, shot to death Jan. 1., 2016, two hours into the new year. And on Saturday, the last day of 2016, as hundreds marched down Michigan Avenue with the crosses held high, some were surprised by how much strength it took to carry them. The crosses were heavy, people agreed. But not as heavy as a casket. \"We're protesting violence. Who are we calling to get involved? Everyone,\" said the Rev. Michael Pfleger of St. Sabina Catholic Church, who organized the march with the help of Greg Zanis, an Aurora-based carpenter known for installing crosses at the sites of tragedies around the country. (Jeremy Gorner) \"Every elected official, every government agency, every business and corporation, every mosque, every synagogue and church, every law enforcement official, every parent, neighbor and resident, and every citizen \u2014 from children to elders. Everyone. We are calling on all of Chicago to take a stand against violence,\" Pfleger said. Before the march, Pfleger and his fellow organizers unloaded the crosses from a truck and lined them up numerically along Pioneer Court, so that families could locate the cross for their loved one based on the day they were killed. \"There!\" a girl\u00a0cried out, sprinting toward the group of crosses marked \"April, Numbers 101 to 188.\" She lifted up one holding a young man's photo and carried it to a crowd of crosses held by others who, like her, had experienced irreversible loss in 2016. Elsewhere, Daisy Villarreal, 19, smiled down at the cross she was about to carry. It bore her brother's name: Jesus Valois. He was 24, and he died Aug. 21 after being shot near his home in the Homan Square neighborhood. Before his death, he was excited by the news that he'd be a father, Villarreal said. Her niece or nephew is due Sunday, on New Year's Day. The family hopes Valois might live again through his child. Perhaps the baby would grow up to be an artist, like his or her father. \"I'm glad to be here,\" Villarreal said. \"A lot of people here are here for the same reason. It's a way to know that it's OK for me to feel this way.\" Families of homicide victims carry over 700 crosses Over 700 crosses were erected and carried along Michigan Avenue on Dec. 31, 2016 \u2014\u00a0one for each person killed in 2016 in Chicago. Greg Zanis, of Aurora, constructed the crosses with the help of volunteers and distributed them to families of the victims. (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) Over 700 crosses were erected and carried along Michigan Avenue on Dec. 31, 2016 \u2014\u00a0one for each person killed in 2016 in Chicago. Greg Zanis, of Aurora, constructed the crosses with the help of volunteers and distributed them to families of the victims. (Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) See more videos The march itself was mostly silent but for the soft sound of a woman reading off the names of the more than 750 homicide victims. The names filled 29 pages, Pfleger said. While most marchers held crosses, some carried framed photographs of their deceased loved ones or strung those photos around their necks. Pedestrians halted their shopping as the marchers passed, and a few retail workers huddled behind the windows of their stores, watching through the glass. During the reading of April's victims, as the crowd was crossing Ontario Street, Lisa Rauckinas, who had traveled from Naperville to spend the day downtown with her husband, Paul, began to cry. She felt shaken by the sight of all the crosses, all the victims' photos. It all made her feel terrible, she said. One of the marchers broke from the crowd to give Rauckinas a hug, and tell her that she appreciated her compassion. \"It's just so powerful. So quiet,\" said Rauckinas, 48. \"These people are literally carrying their burdens.\" ",

Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson expressed condolences to those who lost loved ones, as the city took over from the U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday after an extensive search effort ended in disappointment and became a recovery operation. A dive team was called in to begin the preparations, but by afternoon, officials said weather and water conditions would not allow for the operation to get started until the next morning.\u00a0 Private and U.S. Marine Corps divers are helping in the recovery mission,\u00a0 CBS Cleveland affiliate WOIO reports . A timetable for the mission is unknown, says Khalid Bahhur, commissioner for Burke Lakefront Airport.\u00a0 Police chaplains are also walking Lake Erie\u2019s shores in search of debris, Bahhur said. If any is found, it will be handed over to the National Transportation Safety Board, he said. The Coast Guard will rejoin the search if debris is discovered, WOIO reports. The Coast Guard only takes part in search and rescue missions, which is why the city has stepped in. John T. Fleming, chief executive of a Columbus-based beverage distribution company, was piloting the plane. His wife, Suzanne, their two teenage sons, Andrew and John - who goes by \u201cJack\u201d - and two neighbors whose names have not yet been released were aboard. Fleming\u2019s father, John W. Fleming, told The Columbus Dispatch the family and friends were attending a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game. \u201cWe\u2019re just in shock,\u201d he told the newspaper.\u00a0 The aircraft was headed to Ohio State University Airport, northwest of downtown Columbus. The Coast Guard suspended its search for the plane on Friday. Capt. Michael Mullen, chief of response for the Coast Guard 9th District, said in a statement that \u201cthe decision to suspend a search is never easy.\u201d\u00a0 The statement said that by the time the search was suspended at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, it would have covered more than 128 square miles of Lake Erie and spanned more than 20 hours. Tracking service FlightAware logged only three location pings for the plane after takeoff from the airport, and the last one indicated rapid altitude loss. Authorities have said there were no distress signals from the pilot. They expected three vessels, all equipped with sonar technology, to be on the water Sunday. Bahhur said such accidents are a rare occurrence for the airport. A twin-engine Beechcraft Baron with one person aboard crashed into Lake Erie after taking off from Burke in 2008. Fred Szabo, interim director of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, recalled search efforts to recover the body of the pilot took five or six days. He said the safety of the divers and others involved in the recovery will be weighed as the effort proceeds. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything possible,\u201d Bahhur said. \u201cLike I said, the boat\u2019s in the water right now and the dive team is preparing themselves to go out. It\u2019s going to be on a day-to-day basis.\u201d The aircraft took off westward from Burke on Thursday, then turned north across the lake, according to the tracking service flightradar24.com. The departure procedure at Burke could take an aircraft over the lake before turning south toward a destination, Mullen said. The plane, which had made the roughly half-hour trip from Columbus earlier in the day, was registered to a limited liability company under the same Columbus address as Superior Beverage Group, the company where Fleming was president and CEO. The Federal Aviation Administration said the Cessna Citation 525 plane left Burke at 10:50 p.m., and the Coast Guard said it was notified about the missing plane by air traffic control at Burke about 30 minutes later. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

She said their son is the most influential person in her life, even though they\u2019ve never met. P.J. Wolf\u2019s parents, Jack and Sheila, said their \u201cblonde, blue-eyed, little handsome man-child\u201d was selfless and always looked for ways to help others. He even offered to donate his kidney after watching a news report as a young child. \u201cP.J. came in and he said, \u2018You know, Mom, I\u2019ve got two kidneys and I only need one,\u2019\u201d Sheila recalled. He was killed while riding his bike in 1991. Organ donor P.J. Wolf\u2019s parents say their son was selfless and always looked for ways to help others Close Courtesy of the Wolf family \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any doubt. We knew what this little boy wanted,\u201d Sheila said. His parents donated his organs. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t help our baby but we could help someone else\u2019s baby,\u201d Sheila said. Portell was born with congenital heart defects. She endured two heart surgeries, but they were only temporary solutions. Then at just 4 years old, she underwent open-heart surgery, receiving a donor heart valve that changed her life. It was P.J.\u2019s. \u201cMy entire life from that moment was a gift from my donor,\u201d Portell said. Mother uncovers lasting impact of son\u2019s organ donation She always wanted to thank the family. She tracked down old hospital records and through a medical organization then sent them a letter. \u201cFor some reason I always imagined my donor was older, had lived more life than that. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Portell wrote. \u201cIn your worst moment, you selflessly thought of others and that is why I\u2019m alive today. \u2026 He is the most influential person in my life, my angel and my hero.\u201d The two families exchanged notes for six months. Then they were invited to ride together on the Donate Life float in this year\u2019s 128th Rose Parade.\u00a0 The Wolf family who\u2019s given the ultimate gift feels they\u2019ve also received so much in return. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever underestimate that you are our hero.

Fleming proposes at toast following the tapping of the first Dublin Stout Keg at Brazenhead in Dublin, Ohio. A flight-tracking service shows that a plane piloted by the Ohio executive with five other people onboard quickly lost altitude after taking off from Cleveland's lakeshore airport. The parents of Superior Beverage Company executive John T. Fleming confirmed he was piloting the Columbus-bound plane when it vanished late Thursday, Dec. 29, 2016, over Lake Erie. (ThisWeek Newspapers/The Columbus Dispatch via AP) 0 Shares Email Recovery efforts are expected to begin Sunday for a small plane carrying six people that disappeared over Lake Erie near Cleveland's shores. Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson expressed condolences to those who lost loved ones, as the city took over from the U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday after an extensive search effort ended in disappointment and became a recovery operation. A dive team was called in to begin the preparations, but by afternoon, officials said weather and water conditions would not allow for the operation to get started until the next morning. John T. Fleming, chief executive of a Columbus-based beverage distribution company, was piloting the plane. His wife, Suzanne, their two teenage sons, Andrew and John \u2014 who goes by \"Jack\" \u2014 and two neighbors whose names have not yet been released were aboard. The Associated Press Fleming's father, John W. Fleming, told The Columbus Dispatch the family and friends were attending a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game. \"We're just in shock,\" he told the newspaper. The Coast Guard suspended its search Friday for the plane that vanished shortly after takeoff Thursday night from the city's lakeshore airport. Tracking service FlightAware logged only three location pings for the plane after takeoff from Burke Lakefront Airport, and the last one indicated rapid altitude loss. Authorities have said there were no distress signals from the pilot. They expected three vessels, all equipped with sonar technology, to be on the water Sunday.

The new parents fed their latest addition throughout the day, and continued to incubate the second egg, which has yet to hatch. The first eaglet broke free of its shell early Saturday. But just how hard is it for baby eagles to survive in the wild? According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , though eagles are natural predators, the mortality rate during their first year of life is greater than 50 percent . Occasionally, eaglets are killed in the nest by other eagles fighting over territory, and in rare instances owls can prey on the chicks. Eagles can also crush their eggs if startled or if they step on them accidentally, but they generally take care when entering and exiting the nest. But it's man-made hazards, including lead poisoning, that continue to pose a significant threat to the U.S. eagle population, according to the National Eagle Center . Eagles are carrion birds and often ingest lead by eating bullet fragments or contaminated fish. Even the smallest amounts of lead can damage birds' nervous systems and cause organ failure, potentially killing eagles within days, the center warned. After the eaglets hatch, both parents take turns caring for their newest additions. Male eagles typically spend most of their time hunting and defending the nest, while females feed the new chicks by offering them small strips of fish, which they swallow whole, according to the Center for Conservation Biology. The largest eaglet usually gets the most food, and when food is scarce, the chicks sometimes fight to establish dominance, according to the conservation. This is to ensure that the strongest eagle survives. Related: Eagle Cam Watch: First of Two Eaglets Hatches in Florida Bald eagles are usually read to fledge \u2014 or fly for the first time \u2014 by 9 to 10 weeks of age, the wildlife service said. By then, they are close to being full grown and can weigh as much as their parents. After weeks of strengthening their wings by flapping, young eagles typically make their first flight by gliding to a nearby tree or branch. Eaglets that are reluctant to fly are sometimes forced from the nest by their parents. But even after they learn to fly, eaglets continue to depend on their parents for food. As they grow and their flying improves, chicks begin to harass their parents by stealing food from them. This helps them learn how to hunt and become more independent. After about six months in the nest, the wildlife service says the bonds between baby eagles and their parents begin to fade and the eaglets \u2014 now fully grown \u2014 strike out on their own in search of their own territory and feeding grounds.

Ross Johnson, former CEO of RJR Nabisco, dies at 85 Ken Sweet, AP 5:22 p.m. EST December 31, 2016 A package of Oreos, the iconic Nabisco cookie. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) NEW YORK \u2015 F. Ross Johnson, the former RJR Nabisco CEO depicted as the epitome of corporate greed in the bestselling book and movie Barbarians at the Gate,\u00a0has died. He was 85. The Aycock-Riverside Funeral and Cremation Center in Jupiter, Fla., said Johnson died Thursday. Born in Canada in 1931, Johnson became CEO of RJR Nabisco in 1986, which at the time was the largest consumer goods company in the world, maker of both Oreos and Camel cigarettes. Johnson controversially elected to move RJR Nabisco\u2019s headquarters to Atlanta, from its historical home in Winston-Salem, N.C. In October 1988, Johnson and a group of investors proposed taking  RJR Nabisco private, which started a month-long fierce bidding war for the company among Johnson\u2019s group of investors, Wall Street banks and major private equity companies, including Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts. KKR eventually won the bidding war, paying nearly $25 billion or RJR Nabisco. It was the largest private equity deal in history at the time and helped bring private equity firms, once a small part of Wall Street, into mainstream knowledge. Wall Street\u2019s fierce bidding war, as well as Johnson\u2019s notoriously opulent lifestyle, was dramatized in the book Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco,\u00a0a best-seller later made into a made-for-TV movie. Johnson was depicted as an example of corporate greed and vanity, with RJR Nabisco owning several corporate jets for Johnson\u2019s private use, and numerous country club memberships paid for by the company. And even though Johnson failed to take RJR Nabisco private, he walked away with an estimated $50 million in salary and bonuses as a golden parachute. Johnson never ran a major company after he left RJR Nabisco and effectively retired to Florida. RJR Nabisco was eventually split into two companies in the late 1990s. Nabisco is now owned by Mondelez International, and RJR became the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a subsidiary of Reynolds American. Johnson is survived by two sons and two granddaughters as well as his wife Susan. 3371 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 22 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iQCFOW NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Wilson Ring/AP A Vermont utility company says it found Russian malware on one of it's computers. The discovery came after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security alerted utilities to the code associated with Grizzly Steppe, the name for what the Obama administration has called a Russian hacking operation. Burlington Electric, the municipally-owned utility in Vermont's largest city, issued a statement saying the malware was detected in a single laptop not connected to the company's grid system. \"We took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alerted federal officials of this finding. Our team is working with federal officials to trace this malware and prevent any other attempts to infiltrate utility systems. We have briefed state officials and will support the investigation fully,\" the statement said. Obama Announces Sanctions Against Russia In Response To Alleged Hacking Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin lashed out at the Russian government, saying in a statement, \"Vermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world's leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality-of-life, economy, health, and safety.\" Vermont Public Radio reported on the hacking incident, quoting the state's Public Service Commissioner as saying the hack never threatened the power grid.

Jon C. Ogg, 24/7 Wall St. 6:33 p.m. EST December 31, 2016 The New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) With 2016 behind us, some investors are looking backward to see what worked and what did not. With a 14% rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) this year, the more important issue to consider is what investors should expect for 2017. The Dow has been within 1% of 20,000 for several days now. What if the Dow actually manages to hit 22,000 in 2017? It may be far more possible than most investors might imagine. 24/7 Wall St. has evaluated many of the preliminary views for key companies and industries ahead. Regardless of which candidate voters favored, it is now very hard to find investors who do not view the markets more favorably and more pro-business with higher growth environment. After all, the 8.5% rally in the Dow since the Nov.\u00a08 election is almost unprecedented and is too large to merely assign as a coincidence or as a relief rally. Investors have bought every major market pullback for about six years now, and the bull market is rapidly approaching eight\u00a0years old. Investors are looking for value and overlooked growth, and they are even looking for upside in popular names that simply have more upside to run. It turns out that many of the 30 DJIA stocks have a consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters that calls for substantial upside in the next 12 months. And then investors get to add in the dividends as well. The pro-growth strategies laid out ahead have been a boom for infrastructure companies tied to all sides of major engineering projects and those that process or mine materials. Then there is a lower-regulation and higher-rate environment driving financials and cyclicals. And of course those companies ready to repatriate over $1 trillion in overseas cash are expected to face a much more reasonable corporate tax environment versus other countries. Before just assuming that Dow 20,000 will come and turn into 22,000, it is important to reflect on some real issues. Rallies of this magnitude are rarely, if ever, followed by a straight line higher. Many investors put off traditional year-end profit taking due to expecting lower capital gain taxes in 2017. Many Dow and S&P stocks are now also valued above or very close to their consensus analyst target prices. Many of the Trump-beneficiary stocks also have rallied to the point that much or all of the good news for 2017 already may have taken place. What if the Federal Reserve raises rates more than expected? Will the political infighting of the past decade continue ahead? Also, and sadly, analysts can simply end up being wrong. And we almost never hear about geopolitical risks right now. All of these are risks to the rally not facing a pullback. 24/7 Wall St. showed a preliminary\u00a0 bull-bear case for the Dow in 2016 at 19,700 . The Dow was valued just above 19,200 on Dec.\u00a06 when we first looked at a Dow 20,000+, and the Dow has now hit a high of 19,987 as of Dec.\u00a029. Here are some of the key driving forces that could help the Dow Jones Industrial Average get closer to 22,000 in 2017. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs Group\u00a0( GS ) already has risen to above $240.00 in 2016, and the shares are up 32% just since Nov.\u00a08. Its stock price has passed its $229.00 consensus analyst price target. One reason the Dow has outperformed the S&P 500 since the election is that the Dow\u2019s price-weighted valuation (rather than market cap-weighted for other indexes) is dominated by Goldman Sachs\u2019 8.3% index weighting, almost three-times the average Dow stock\u2019s weighting. It has accounted for close to one-fourth of the Dow\u2019s post-election gain. The Best CEOs of 2016 Some analysts see even more bright skies ahead for Goldman Sachs. Outside of the company landing two top positions in the upcoming administration, HSBC is calling for a $250 target and Deutsche Bank now has\u00a0a $255 target. If lower regulation allows for more trading, Goldman Sachs\u2019 profit history could dictate even better earnings and far more upside than its paltry 1% dividend yield. Apple Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) was last seen trading at close to $116, and its 52-week high is just $118.69. Apple\u2019s consensus price target is now up at $132.00 and has climbed slowly higher for months. Apple\u2019s 2% dividend yield could rise handily if the company repatriates its massive overseas cash sum of close to $200 billion, and Apple is valued at only about 11 times next year\u2019s earnings estimate. Credit Suisse just on December 6 reiterated its Outperform rating and $150 price target for Apple with hopes of iPhone 8 super-cycle. Recent reports of the big product being an iPhone 7s in 2017 could jeopardize that, but Apple has the largest cash trove of all companies (by far) and it buys back large amounts of stock. Apple\u2019s 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $118.69, its market cap is $622 billion and its weighting of 4.03% in the Dow is ranked just 10th out of 30 index components. Cisco Systems Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO ) has recovered to $30.22, and its consensus analyst target is $33.11. It also has close to a 3.4% dividend yield, and the company is a monster when it comes to buying back shares. Cisco shares are valued at 12 times forward earnings. They\u00a0are still about 10% shy of its 2007 high, and the share price is still less than half of its all-time back in the tech bubble peak in 2000. The 52-week range here is $22.46 to $31.95, and the market cap is $153 billion. RBC just named it\u00a0 among the top tech picks for 2017 \u00a0and the firm is calling for a $35 share price for Cisco. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Co. ( KO ) has been a sleeper, but what if 2017 is the breakout year for the sugar-water giant? Its $41.46  share price is well shy of the consensus price target of $45.75, and the 3.4% dividend yield would imply north of 15% upside. The stock is valued at 20 times expected earnings per share. Despite being more dependent on sugary beverages than rival Pepsi, the reality is that Coca-Cola has been diversifying away from its name brand for years. The stock has been a sleeper for so long, and it mostly has been in a $39 to $44 trading band for the past three years. Coca-Cola still has global expansion opportunities and cost containment opportunities ahead, and it is possible that value investors will begin to focus on what may be a defensive stock with limited downside. Coca-Cola also has raised its dividend for more than 50 years and has a market value of close to $180 billion. Home Depot Home Depot Inc. ( HD ) has recovered to $134.08  as of December's end, and its consensus price target now has risen to $147. That and its 2% dividend yield would generate upside of over 10%. The stock is valued at 18 times expected earnings for next year. Home Depot ran into some issues after peaking in the summer. But\u00a0weak consumer and a slowing in housing have now been replaced by a euphoric consumer and expectations for a strong housing market to continue. It seems hard for Home Depot to not participate in this retail and housing upside. Home Depot has a 52-week range of $109.62 to $139.00 and a market cap of $164 billion. Intel Shares of Intel Corp. ( INTC ) were last seen trading at $36.30, and its consensus price target is now almost $40. Intel\u2019s dividend yield is also close to 3%, and it is valued at less than 13 times 2017 earnings. America's 25 Thriving Industries What has occurred is that the personal computer\u00a0market finally has come back due to gaming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intel also has expanded well beyond desktops; it is deep in servers and the Internet of Things, and it is even a growing partner for many chip companies now. Intel\u2019s market cap is $174 billion, and it has traded in 52-week range of $27.68 to $38.36. Nike Nike Inc. ( NKE )  was the worst stock of 2016, down 17% for the  year. With shares last seen at nearly $51, the consensus price target is $62, and that implies 20% upside \u2014 with lots of room for its mere 1% dividend yield to grow, on top of share buybacks. Nike is the leader in the athletic apparel market and there have been concerns that \u201cathleisure\u201d has peaked. Brands like Under Armour, Adidas and Reebok also want their piece of Nike\u2019s market. What is amazing about all the negativity here is that analysts expect Nike to grow sales to $41 billion in 2019 from about $32 billion in 2016, with earnings growth expected to be about 40% over the same period. What if everyone has been too negative here? Nike\u2019s 52-week trading range is $49.01 to $68.19, and it has a market cap of $85 billion. Pfizer Pfizer Inc. ( PFE ) was trading at $32.35, and its consensus price target of $37.65 implies upside of 16.4%, even before considering a dividend yield of almost 4%. Pfizer shares are valued at only about 12 times forward earnings. 2016 has been a dud for Pfizer, with a gain of just 4%, versus a 16% gain so far for rival Merck. Pfizer had been torn in long-term efforts, like whether to move or acquire overseas, deciding if the restructuring would lead to a break-up, and deciding whether to sell some assets. There was also the overhang of political pricing pressure on drug prices. While cheap underperforming stocks are that way for a reason, what if Pfizer has become too cheap versus Merck, or what if it releases some unexpected news or makes a great acquisition in 2017? Pfizer\u2019s market cap is $196 billion, and its shares have a 52-week range of $28.25 to $37.39. Procter & Gamble Last seen trading near $84, Procter & Gamble ( PG ) has a consensus analyst upside of $91.00. This is still almost 10% in implied upside, without even considering its 3% dividend yield. The consumer products giant has restructured and pared down its brands, but it is still valued at 19.5 times forward earnings. Procter & Gamble has raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years now. One issue is that it has faced is harder overseas sales comps due to that strong dollar, and it seems hard to imagine that the company can shrink its brands back into a growth company. Still, this is a company that remains quite friendly to shareholders. Perhaps its endless list of brands should just speak for itself. The 52-week range is $74.46 to $90.33, and its market cap is $225 billion, making the company\u00a0larger than its top three consumer products peers in the United States combined. UnitedHealth UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH ) was trading at $160.04, and the consensus price target has lifted to $179 now. This implies upside of 11%, before considering its 1.5% dividend yield. What is amazing about the expected upside is that UnitedHealth shares have risen almost 40% in 2016, and 13% of those gains have come since the election. The largest insurer of them all is valued at about 17 times expected 2017 earnings. Being a health insurer under Obamacare turned out to be fine for UnitedHealth, and now it seems that analysts have little fears around a Trump effort to replace Obamacare. It has vacated most exchange operations and is focused on the group market and other value-added opportunities. How the health insurer ultimately will be treated under a regime in which Obamacare gets dismantled remains to be seen. Still, even the lowest analyst price target would imply a 5% drop and the highest analyst target is $200. UnitedHealth has a market cap of over $150 billion, and its weighting is 5.5% of the Dow\u2019s 30 components. Visa Visa Inc. ( V ) was last seen at $78.02, and it has a consensus price target of $94.20, for an implied upside of 20%. Its dividend yield of less than 1% could have exponential upside, as it is less than one-fourth of earnings. Visa could be a huge winner from repatriation efforts, and a strong consumer spending environment should allow it to ring the register as it wins each time there are credit card transactions. Visa shares are well off of prior highs, but it is still valued at almost 20 times forward earnings. Many investors think of Visa a financial powerhouse now that it is a newer Dow component, but Visa is actually a platform provider with massive room to boost its weak dividend. Still, every company under the sun seems to want a piece of payment technology, and that has weighed at least some on Visa\u2019s dominance. If analysts are right, then Visa shares have pulled back too far from its 52-week high of $83.96. Its shares are actually down since the election, and they\u00a0have risen less than 2% so far in 2016. Again, there are many circumstances that have to occur for this recent enthusiasm to last. It would only be prudent to expect that some of the typical year-end profit-taking being delayed into next year might bring some selling early on. And it is possible that the strength of the post-election rally has already borrowed from the 2017 upside. Many analysts are certain to update and issue more formal 2017 targets after the start of the year. The formal bull-bear case for 2017 has to be followed by policy and structural changes in Washington, D.C., and a return to more rapid economic growth. The Dow has risen about 8.5% since November 8 alone, and the year-to-date gains in 2016 have been just over 14%. For a relative value between these Dow stocks and the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 was last seen valued at 17.3 times expected 2017 earnings per share and at 18.7 times its 2016 estimated earnings per share. 24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Koji Sasahara/AP hide caption toggle caption Koji Sasahara/AP Bubbles float over visitors during a New Year's Eve celebration event a Tokyo hotel. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gave a speech at Pearl Harbor about the power of reconciliation in the waning days of 2016. Koji Sasahara/AP The final days of 2016 made for a dramatic time in diplomacy. A quick roundup: The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank; Israel (and President-elect Donald Trump) admonished the U.S. for allowing the vote to pass; John Kerry reiterated his disapproval of the settlements in a blunt speech; and British Prime Minister Theresa May in turn admonished Kerry , though the U.K. was a key broker in the deal. Then there were the sanctions the White House announced in response to Russia's alleged interference in the U.S. election, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's response that he, er, would not respond \u2014 for now. Thanks To Russia, 2016 Isn't Really Going To End For Obama And Trump There were some bright spots on the world stage, though: There is an effort to end violence in Syria that the U.N. supported Saturday with a new resolution. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe became the first Japanese leader to visit Pearl Harbor. He delivered a powerful message of reconciliation. Other world leaders offered messages for the new year on Saturday. President Vladimir Putin reportedly congratulated the Russian people for persevering through a difficult year, according to The Wall Street Journal. Putin also extended his congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, meanwhile, is well-known for his active Twitter presence. which was often a source of criticism during the election season \u2014 prompting rumors that his staff took away his tweeting privileges in the final days of the campaign. On New Year's Eve the president-elect tweeted an unusual holiday message. Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2016 President Obama gave his weekly address Saturday morning, taking the opportunity to wish everyone a happy new year and look back on his presidency: \"Twenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance. Our kids' high school graduation rate is at an all-time high. We've brought 165,000 troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, and took out Osama Bin Laden. Through diplomacy we shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program, opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba, and brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our kids.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

    "text": "Revelers around the world say hello to 2017, goodbye to a year of conflicts (Tribune news services) As 2016 drew to a close, revelers around the world bid a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts and deaths of legendary celebrities. Here's a look at how people ushered in the new year: NEW YORK CITY An estimated 1 million people ushered in the new year in Times Square, screaming and kissing as the glittering crystal ball dropped. New Year's Eve revelers began to fill Times Square hours before midnight. They braved cold temperatures and strong winds at the Crossroads of the World to greet 2017 amid heavy police protection. Maria Raimilla, from New Jersey, said 2016 was rough. \"Everything is going to be new,\" she said at midnight. \"I just want to find happiness this year and leave all the bad things behind.\" Lori Haan, from Tucson, Arizona, and her husband were on their first trip to New York. She said she's looking forward to what 2017 brings. \"This is a great start to the new year,\" she said. \"We are doing something new and exciting, and I hope that it's a theme for the rest of the year.\" Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand blocked off streets leading to the celebration zone to avoid the possibility of a truck attack like those in Germany and France in recent months. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, were on guard.

Fireworks explode around the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge as New Year's celebrations get underway in Sydney, Australia, Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016. (Rick Rycroft / AP) AUSTRALIA Sydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016's fallen icons with a New Year's Eve fireworks display honoring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. The glittering display over Sydney's famed harbor and bridge featured Saturn and star-shaped fireworks set to \"Space Oddity,\" the classic song by Bowie \u2014 one of the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. Wilder was also honored as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colors while a song from Wilder's famed film \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" played. TURKEY New Year's celebrations turned deadly when an armed assailant believed to have been dressed as Santa Claus opened fire at a nightclub in Istanbul , killing dozens of people. Istanbul's governor said at least 35 people were killed and 40 others were wounded. Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty, some camouflaged as street vendors. Ankara and Istanbul have been targeted by several attacks in 2016 carried out by the Islamic State group or Kurdish rebels, killing more than 180 people. Neslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighborhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with \"unrest and death.\" \"2016 affected everyone badly,\" she said. BRAZIL More than 2 million people have welcomed 2017 at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach. Twelve minutes of fireworks amazed many of the more than 860,000 tourists who traveled to Rio for the party. The event was more modest than last year due to the city's recession. Still, tourists and Brazilians enjoyed a festival of sounds, including two sets of drums from popular samba schools.

(Michael Sohn / AP) GERMANY In Berlin the mood was more somber than celebratory. \"I don't like the way politics is going,\" said Daniel Brandt. \"Fears are being fanned and people are so angry with each other.\" The tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. Two Israeli tourists, on a visit to the German capital, seemed at a loss when asked about their wishes for 2017. \"Peace on Earth. Just happiness, really,\" said Nathan and Libat, declining to give their last names. Walking by the Reichstag, Germany's Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. \"I came to Germany from Afghanistan,\" he said. \"Life is better here.\" Birgitta Bergquist, a recent retiree visiting Berlin from Sweden, said she looked forward to spending more time with her 3-year-old granddaughter. \"And we hope the family stays healthy.\" Nicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: \" Brexit , Trump, Erdogan \u2014 it's all getting worse. \"I'm a convinced European and I hope Europe doesn't collapse in 2017,\" she said. Later, police said they arrested a man who shouted \"bomb, bomb, bomb\" at Berlin's massive open-air New Year's party. Using the hashtag \"#nichtlustig\" \u2014 meaning \"not funny\" \u2014 Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man \"is now celebrating #Welcome2017 with us.\" Russia Alexander Zemlianichenko Jr / AP Fireworks explode over the Kremlin in Red Square, which was blocked by police, during New Year celebrations in Moscow, Russia, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017.

(Alexander Zemlianichenko Jr / AP) RUSSIA President Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year's Eve remarks to the nation. \"Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,\" Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia's 11 time zones. \"To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret,\" he said. New Year's Eve is Russia's major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations.

Pope Francis kisses a statue of the Divine Infant as he celebrates a new year's eve vespers Mass in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016. (Andrew Medichini / AP) THE VATICAN Pope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of \"a culture that idolizes youth\" and yet has made no place for the young. Francis said during vespers marking New Year's Eve that young people have been \"pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.\" More than responsibility, the pope said the world owed young people a debt, saying it has deprived them of \"dignified and genuine work\" that would allow them to take part in society, instead condemning them \"to knock on doors that for the most part remain closed.\" JAPAN Temple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. Kami Miyamoto, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, traveled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. Miyamoto's mother was preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year's Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. CHINA Residents in Beijing and Shanghai, China's two largest cities, passed New Year's Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. The Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai's waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his New Year's Eve address his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China's territorial rights.

Buddhists light candles during New Year celebrations at Jogye Buddhist temple in Seoul, South Korea, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. (Ahn Young joon / AP) SOUTH KOREA Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park's impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. The evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul's traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. The city's mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking, and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan's World War II military. Park Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. \"So many unbelievable things happened in 2016. It didn't feel real; if felt like a movie,\" protester Lee Huymi said about the bizarre scandal that brought Park down. \"So I hope 2017 brings a movie-like ending to the mess.\" INDIA For most people in India, New Year's Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. The western city of Mumbai was to host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money \u2014 India's recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. PHILIPPINES The Philippines' notorious tradition of dangerous New Year's Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. Powerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. Duterte's southern Davao City hasn't been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city's crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. Before New Year's Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days, mostly children under 15. ROMANIA New Year's is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands of people flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017. Former Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, traveling to the mountain town of Sinaia, said Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood. \"People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,\" he said. \"Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.\" Early Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats, a New Year symbol, while waving wands made of dried flowers.

(Jon Gambrell / AP) UNITED ARAB EMIRATES In Dubai, hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks shoot from the sides of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. There was no repeat of the chaos of last year, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at a skyscraper nearby. FINLAND CENTENARY Finland has kicked off celebrations for 100 years of independence from Russia. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Helsinki for a concert and a huge fireworks display to celebrate the beginning of festivities marking its independence. Throughout 2017 there will be hundreds of events in the Nordic nation of 5.5 million, from films, dance parties and environment-related events to concerts and activities linked to its renowned sauna tradition. Celebrations will culminate on Dec. 6, the day Finnish Parliament declared independence in 1917 amid the turmoil of the Russian Revolution. Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday congratulated Finland for its centenary in a phone conversation with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. MEXICO CITY Thousands of people in Mexico City are expected to turn out for a New Year's Eve concert at the Monument to Independence, better known as The Angel. Workers spent several days setting up a stage and a booming sound system along a stretch of the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard. Streets were blocked off in the area, and 2,000 police officers were on hand for security. The lineup includes a mix of Latin pop and balladeer Jorge \"Coque\" Muniz, with cumbia band Los Angeles Azules heating things up after a midnight fireworks show. Associated Press ",

Cooper is seen here with his wife, Kristin, at an election night rally in Raleigh. Gerry Broome/AP A North Carolina judge is temporarily blocking a law that would have limited the power of the state's incoming governor. Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper defeated incumbent Republican Pat McCrory in November in a tight race. After the election, the Republican controlled Legislature passed two laws to limit the governor's power, in what Democrats called a \"power grab.\" The law put on hold Friday would, as we reported earlier this month , remove the State Board of Elections from the governor's control by reducing the number of members on the board from five \u2014 three of whom could be from the governor's party \u2014 to four members, evenly split between the parties. N.C. Republicans Move To Limit Powers Of Incoming Democratic Governor The Associated Press reports that law is now on hold: \"Wake County Superior Court Judge Don Stephens ruled Friday that the risk to free and fair elections justified stopping the law from taking effect this weekend until it could be reviewed more closely. Stephens plans to review the law Thursday.\" The AP reports that Cooper filed the lawsuit earlier on Friday \u2014 and got the temporary reprieve just days before he is set to take office. Cooper's term begins on Sunday. Meanwhile, a second law, passed two weeks ago, also puts a check on the incoming governor's power . It would require Cooper's Cabinet secretaries to receive Senate confirmation, significantly reduce the number of administrative positions in the executive branch, strip the governor of his right to appoint trustees to the University of North Carolina and take away some of the governor's power to oversee schools in the state. Republicans still hold large majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature. Article continues after sponsorship ",

Michael Mullen of the U.S. Coast Guard answers questions during a news conference at Burke Lakefront Airport on Dec. 30, 2016, in Cleveland. (Tony Dejak / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter A dive team was assembled in Cleveland on Saturday to begin recovery efforts for a small plane carrying six people that disappeared over Lake Erie near Cleveland's shores. Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson expressed condolences to the family and friends of those who lost loved ones, as the city took over from the U.S. Coast Guard after an extensive search effort ended in disappointment. John T. Fleming, chief executive of a Columbus-based beverage distribution company, was piloting the plane. His wife, Suzanne, their two teenage sons, John \"Jack\" and Andrew, and two neighbors whose names have not yet been released were aboard. Fleming's father, John W. Fleming, told The Columbus Dispatch the family and friends were attending a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game. \"We're just in shock,\" he told the newspaper. The Coast Guard suspended its search Friday for the plane that vanished shortly after takeoff Thursday night from the city's lakeshore airport. Officials said divers and other marine experts were meeting to set a recovery strategy to be run out of a unified command center at Burke Lakefront Airport. They planned to begin the search at the last point of contact with the small aircraft. Tracking service FlightAware logged only three location pings for the plane after takeoff from Burke Lakefront Airport, and the last one indicated rapid altitude loss. Authorities have said there were no distress signals from the pilot. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story With the sitting president calling Russia a national security threat and the incoming one praising Mr. Putin, many American voters, long accustomed to being suspicious about Russia, are understandably confused and uneasy. Russia was an enemy on Friday morning, and a friend by the afternoon. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe are in a whiplash moment right now, and I think it is unprecedented in several respects,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk assessment firm in Washington, and a former State Department official from the Clinton administration. \u201cThe most important one is that the baton is about to be passed from an administration with a very hard line on Russia to one that is very much more sympathetic.\u201d No clear agreements or even offers are on the table yet, however, bringing uncertainty. \u201cRussia\u2019s relations with the U.S. are currently up in the air \u2014 both sides have no clear strategy about how to move them forward,\u201d said Aleksandr Morozov, an independent Russian political analyst. Until the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and even for years afterward, matters were more black and white. A young American diplomat stationed in Moscow named George F. Kennan established the parameters of the relationship for decades with a famous 1947 policy paper. The Soviet Union was bent on expansion, he wrote, so the main element of any United States policy had to be containment. Thus began a long roller coaster ride for the two countries, full of periodic upswings as friends when d\u00e9tente was in vogue, inevitably followed by precipitous plummets as foes that left the world shuddering about the prospects of a nuclear Armageddon. Tensions eased periodically, but it never seemed to last. President Ronald Reagan, an implacable anti-Communist, surprised the world by reaching out to the man who turned out to be the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, to begin negotiations for far-reaching arms control agreements between the two sides. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Russian Federation that emerged entered into an extended period of decline and, inevitably, friendship with the United States as a kind of junior partner. That \u201cjunior\u201d aspect rankled, however, particular after Mr. Obama went from seeking to reset relations to dismissing Russia as a \u201cregional power.\u201d The latest crisis began in 2014, with a revolution in Ukraine that Mr. Putin labeled an American plot \u2014 he, as many Soviet leaders have, sees the hidden hand of Washington everywhere. Mr. Putin annexed Crimea and armed rebels in eastern Ukraine, prompting Western economic sanctions, which Mr. Trump has disparaged. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The last confrontation under the Obama administration between Moscow and Washington came to a head this fall after American intelligence agencies concluded that hacking by their Russian counterparts had breached national security, cracking open the computers of the Democratic National Committee to reveal emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump initially encouraged the Kremlin to hack even more, breaking with all precedents, not least the Republican tradition of painting Russia as the evil empire, as Mr. Reagan called it. Mr. Obama waited to react until last week, and it looked as if he might leave his successor a diplomatic tempest, until Mr. Putin, long the master of the unexpected stroke, defused it. Mr. Trump suddenly gained room to maneuver . \u201cTrump\u2019s spirit is already here, and already changing Russia\u2019s policies,\u201d said Igor M. Bunin, the director of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow research institute. \u201cThis will be a great plus for future relations.\u201d There are still potential pitfalls, however, not least that Congress does not share an affectionate view of Mr. Putin. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, plans to open hearings on Thursday on Russia\u2019s efforts to manipulate the presidential election. Much of the Republican establishment in Congress endorsed the new sanctions imposed against Russia, putting them at odds with Mr. Trump. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, was with Mr. McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, last week to tour the Baltic States, which fear being the next target of the Russian military. \u201cThe Russian cyberattack, and the misinformation and propaganda \u2014 they have been living with this for decades,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview. American voters have heard Mr. Trump praise Russia, and some in the far right have hailed Mr. Putin as a hero for espousing conservative values. Yet old instincts die hard. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI worry about what our relationship with other countries is going to be with a Trump presidency, if we buddy-buddy up to Russia and a leader who is not so democratic in nature,\u201d said Alexis Matter, 35, walking through a Denver shopping mall. In Sandy Springs, Ga., Chase Williams, 26, the manager of a pet supply store, said that Russia had fallen off the radar in recent years. His fears now were less of the old Cold War over a nuclear weapons attack than a sense that Mr. Putin could outfox the American administration. \u201cWhen I say Russia scares me, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m scared of them coming over here and doing something,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m scared when I see a chess player playing checkers \u2014 and we are checkers.\u201d Mr. Putin has made no secret of the fact that he would like to re-establish the consensus reached with the United States at the 1945 Yalta conference that carved the globe into spheres of influence. Russia no longer has the might needed to assert its right to be a superpower, analysts say, but if nothing else, cyberattacks have underscored that you do not need nuclear weapons or a strong economy to assert global influence. Some Russian analysts wonder what Mr. Putin can offer Mr. Trump. A former K.G.B. agent, he tends to view the world order as a series of special operations, coming from a different arena than Mr. Trump\u2019s world of business deals. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Putin has a plan,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political analyst and former media adviser to Mr. Putin. \u201cI think that he is stunned by the number of bonus points that he has gotten.\u201d In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad is on the verge of reasserting control over much of the country, thanks largely to Mr. Putin\u2019s intervention. Ukraine presents some problems, but has essentially boiled down into the kind of frozen conflict that Russia uses to destabilize independent-minded neighbors. And all of the attention on the cyberattacks made Mr. Putin look strong. In those successes, analysts see fodder for Mr. Putin to offer Mr. Trump a manner of foreign policy victory that would give the American leader something tangible to crow about at home in an arena where he lacks experience.

Mr. Trump has stated that he wants to join forces with Russia in crushing the jihadists. Or the Kremlin could offer some sort of cyberspace deal. \u201cI think that Putin is in a strong position,\u201d said Nicolai Petrov, a Russian political scientist. \u201cHe looks strong in relation to the United States and he has freedom to maneuver, and he can do what he wants to demonstrate that the United States should recognize that Russia is not a regional power but a great power that should be taken into account.\u201d So, for the moment, Mr. Putin appears a potential friend to Mr. Trump. Few expect it to last, however. First of all, Mr. Trump is unpredictable. And fundamentally, the two countries are destined to be at odds, because they view the world through different lenses. Russian policy in recent years has been trying to sow doubt and undermine public faith in Western governments. The Kremlin has relied on a variety of levers \u2014 disinformation campaigns, buying influence , cyberattacks \u2014 which many analysts expect to show up in crucial elections in the coming year in France and Germany. \u201cThey are trying to create more of a level playing field not by raising Russia up, but through a declining West,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Putin is out to make America great again.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow, Alan Blinder from Sandy Springs, Ga., Julie Turkewitz from Denver, and Noah Weiland from Washington.

    "text": "Debbie Reynolds: A trouper all the way Mourning David Bowie requires tremendous energy because there are so many David Bowies to mourn. The lost cosmonaut. The alien balladeer. The pansexual glamourpuss. The rake. The maestro. The fashionista. The freak. He was humanity\u2019s ultimate and most giving rock star. A chameleon bearing gifts. For five decades, Bowie \u2014 who died Jan. 10\u00a0at age 69 \u2014 reimagined himself over and over again, colorfully implying that music should change while quietly insisting that human beings can change. In that sense, Bowie\u2019s mutations were a manifestation of his generosity. Being yourself is fine, but being every iteration of yourself is living. Renewal is possible. Still. Always. He made sure that we learned that big lesson with our eyes as well as our ears. As rock\u2019s greatest shape-shifter, Bowie always had fresh ideas about love, alienation, pleasure and progress churning beneath each new haircut. With an imagination deeper than his wardrobe, he was an omni-star, casually drifting across a vast terrain at high speeds.

Frustrated, he told his buddy, Glenn Frey, to give it a try. And with a single phrase \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford\ufffd? \u2014 Frey invented the California country-rock sound and launched one of the biggest bands of all time. \u201cTake It Easy,\ufffd? recorded by the Eagles and released in 1972, rose to No. 12 on the pop charts and introduced the world to the Detroit-born singer with the bloodshot eyes and outlaw moustache. The song also marked the beginning of the sometimes glorious, sometimes dysfunctional reign for the Eagles, a band that would go on to sell more than 150 million records. Read complete story (AP) Maurice White: Shaping the essential playlist of black lives By Lonnae O\u2019Neal | Feb. 4 My kids can always tell when I\u2019m listening to a song by the \u201cElements of the Universe, ladies and gentlemen,\ufffd? as the jocks on old black radio would sometimes introduce Earth, Wind and Fire. I\u2019d close my eyes and twist up my face. I\u2019d tighten my fists as the horns would rise. By the time the lyrics settled about my head, I was already gone. Singing along. Feeling a sacred pull in all my secular places. It was: You need devotion. Bless the children. It was: If you look way down in your heart and soul, don\u2019t hesitate \u2019cause the world seems cold . . . It was: Now, I\u2019m craving your body, is this real? Temperatures rising, I don\u2019t want to feel. I\u2019m in the wrong place to be real. When my husband called to say that Maurice White, 74, who founded Earth, Wind and Fire in the late 1960s had died of Parkinson\u2019s disease Feb. 4, I was already grieving. White wrote many of the hits for the group, which won six Grammy Awards, sold 90 million records worldwide and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But they meant so much more than that. It\u2019s impossible to pick your favorite Earth, Wind and Fire song, because it\u2019s always the one that\u2019s playing right now. We grew up listening, putting our needles on their records with our brothers and sisters. \u201cThey took it to the cosmic,\ufffd? my husband, Tom, said, and he\u2019s right about that. Read complete story (AP) How Harper Lee lost control of her legacy By Ron Charles | Feb. 19 The sadness of Harper Lee\u2019s death Feb. 19\u00a0in Monroeville, Ala., is deepened by the painful controversies that attended the last few years of her life. Long adored as the author of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\ufffd? Lee found herself caught in a morass of claims and counterclaims about her competency to manage her own literary legacy. \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\ufffd? is still devoured by countless new and repeat readers around the world. Teenagers study the Depression-era story of Scout and Jem every year. Lawyers routinely say that Scout\u2019s father, Atticus Finch, inspired them to study law. But ironically, lawyers and legal ambiguities eventually threatened to overshadow Lee\u2019s life and work. What a shame. There was, for decades, something ineffably pure about Lee\u2019s singular American classic, published in 1960. The author\u2019s reluctance to give interviews, her resistance to all the self-promotional schemes of modern publishing, and especially her refusal to write another novel contributed to the mythos of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\ufffd? Unfettered by any distractions except Horton Foote\u2019s glorious movie version, the story of Scout\u2019s moral awakening and her father\u2019s brave fight against bigotry remained preserved in the Mason jar of our collective consciousness, a tribute to the better angels of our nature.

By Geoff Edgers | March 8 Yes, Sir George Martin accomplished so much as the fifth Beatle, from the crunch of those early records to the experimentation of \u201cRevolver\ufffd? and beyond, but there\u2019s one important moment I\u2019d like to remember: The time Martin wasn\u2019t involved in making Beatles music. Those are the 1994 sessions during which the remaining three took John Lennon\u2019s late-\u201970s demos for \u201cFree as a Bird\ufffd? and \u201cReal Love\ufffd? and tried to produce them up into a so-called reunion. \u201cFree as a Bird\ufffd? was certainly a hit, cracking the top 10 shortly after its 1995 release. It also served as a key marketing tool for the launch of the Beatles \u201cAnthology\ufffd? series. It also sounded terrible.

Across two jouncing verses, Phife Dawg explains why his \u201cblood pressure\u2019s blowin\u2019 up\ufffd? in priceless detail. Smash-and-grabbers lift the stereo out of his car. A flakey girl stands him up for a date. His kid brother throws a hissy-fit in the aisles of a KB toy store. And then, adding insult to injury, some referee tosses his favorite shooting guard out of the Knicks game: \u201cTo top it off, Starks got ejected.\ufffd? Amazing that all of this high-spirited self-deprecation could still spark smiles on Tuesday as news spread across the internet that Phife \u2014 born Malik Taylor \u2014 had died earlier in the morning. He was 45 years old, and while the cause of death wasn\u2019t immediately announced, it\u2019s widely known that Phife underwent a kidney transplant in 2008 after being diagnosed with diabetes in 1990.

Works of comedy are now often judged on their \u201ccringeworthiness,\ufffd? which is a shorthand way of describing an exact combination of hubris and humiliation, in situations that are once absurd and yet universal. Its ingredients include neurosis, self-absorption and the certitude that hell really is other people. It involves being a kind of loser, but never a clown.

Frank Lloyd Wright made it to 91 and I.M. Pei is still alive at 98, the same age that Philip Johnson died. So it was a shock to hear that Zaha Hadid, the first woman to win the prestigious Pritzker Prize, died March 31 at age 65, in Miami, where she was under treatment for bronchitis. It was especially shocking because Hadid was one of the most forceful personalities in contemporary architecture, renowned as a trailblazer and an imperious maverick who didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly. It will take years, if not decades, to sort through Hadid\u2019s legacy. Among her most high-profile projects were the Aquatics Center for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the 2010 Guangzhou Opera House in China and the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center in Baku, Azerbaijan, finished in 2012. But many of Hadid\u2019s most ambitious projects are still underway, including plans for a stadium in Qatar to host the 2022 soccer World Cup. And Hadid embodied what many felt were the worst impulses of the most recent age of architectural exuberance: designs that indulged sculptural excess over logic and efficiency and the cultivation of celebrity status, which often seemed to insulate her from constructive criticism. She spoke the airy language of architectural theory, with all its utopian overtones, but she vigorously branded consumer products from candles to tableware to neckties. She worked regularly, and enthusiastically, in countries with authoritarian governments, designing them spectacular and expensive cultural centers and other vanity projects.

A few months earlier, Haggard had been named a Kennedy Center honoree, and I had been sent to a casino parking lot in Lake Charles to interview the country legend about his life and times. Stepping aboard his tour bus, I immediately realized I was speaking with a wounded man. Haggard was 73. A cancerous chunk of his lung had been removed in 2008 and he was just now recovering from a related infection that burned deep in his chest. When I told him that it seemed insane for a man in his state to be out on the road, he nodded in solemn agreement. He said that touring was a compulsion, an obligation, a trap he didn\u2019t feel that he deserved to get sprung from.

As the camera pans across the crowd, we see Jheri-curled funk dudes, Aqua Net glam girls, mulleted wastoids, preps and punks. And that\u2019s exactly who Prince wanted to see when he looked out into this vicious world: a radical congregation of disparate individuals being different, being together, being free. Whether we\u2019ve gotten any closer to that purple paradise over the past three decades is up for debate, but here\u2019s what isn\u2019t: Modernity has produced no greater pop star than Prince. The unexpected news of his death April 21 at age 57 certainly felt cruel to anyone who has ever believed in music as a force of enlightenment. This man was a superhero who summoned humanity onto a new dance floor with an effortlessly utopian swirl of funk, soul and rock-and-roll. He was a visionary songwriter, a top-shelf guitarist, a master-architect of rhythm, a breath-stealing vocalist and an unparalleled tornado of a live performer. Since his auspicious debut in 1978, he projected a mysterious, enduring invincibility. And now he\u2019s gone. The shock is enough to make your brain go blank. Read complete story (S. Karin Epstein for The Washington Post) Edward Albee: The last of the giants By Peter Marks | Sept. 16 \u201cI try to, but I can\u2019t control the world,\ufffd? Edward Albee once said. He was being modest \u2014 and uncharacteristically so. Because in the world of his creation, a world in which the stage churned with resentment and bubbled with anxiety and simmered in ambiguity, Albee was consummately in control. A maestro of linguistic control of international caliber, to be sure, on a par with his fellows in the pantheons of modernism and absurdism, Ireland\u2019s Samuel Beckett and Britain\u2019s Harold Pinter. Both of those giants were awarded Nobel Prizes for literature, and how Albee eluded the Nobel Committee\u2019s similar approbation is a puzzlement that leaves, in the wake of his death Sept. 16 at the age of 88, a lamentable missing passage on an extraordinary r\u00e9sum\u00e9.

    "text": "advertisement Thirty-five people were killed after a gunman opened fire on an Istanbul nightclub during New Year's celebrations, the governor said, in a shooting that was described as an act of terror. Forty others were wounded in the attack targeting the popular Reina nightclub in Istanbul's Ortakoy district, Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said according to CNN Turk. Special forces were sealing off a 2-mile radius around the nightclub, and security at the venue told NBC News the attacker was still believed to be inside. Ambulances transport wounded people after a gun attack on Reina, a popular night club in Istanbul near by the Bosphorus, early morning in Istanbul, Turkey on Jan. 1, 2017. STR / EPA The attacker killed a police officer and a civilian before entering the club at around 1:15 a.m. local time, Sahin said according to state media Anadolu Agency . \"He then carried out this violent and cruel act by spraying bullets on innocent people who were celebrating the New Year,\" Sahin said according to Anadolu Agency. The attacker was carrying a \"long barreled weapon,\" Sahin said. He did not say which group if any was suspected in the attack, and it did not appear that any group has immediately claimed responsibility. There were more than 500 people inside the club at the time, private NTV television reported. Ten of the wounded were in critical condition, Sahin said. Thirty-four of those killed were civilians, and one of the dead was a police officer, the governor said. People flee as ambulances are on the site of a reported attack on an Istanbul nightclub on January 1, 2017. IHLAS NEWS AGENCY / AFP - Getty Images Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, state news agency Anadolu reported. Ankara and Istanbul have been targeted by several attacks in 2016 carried out by ISIS or Kurdish rebels, killing more than 180 people. Earlier this month two bombings near a stadium in the city killed 38 people, mostly police officers, and injured 155 others. A Turkey-based Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility for that attack. Cities around the world stepped up security in anticipation of New Year's and following the truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin and other terror attacks. New York City Police Department officials said Saturday they were redeploying some counter-terrorism teams and patrols to nightclubs as that city prepared to celebrate New Year's. The police officials cautioned there is no new specific or credible threats to New York. Phil Helsel ",

Officials estimated as many as a million celebrants would descend upon the Crossroads of the World, braving cold temperatures and strong winds to ring in the New Year amid heavy police protection. Stefania Moran, from Puebla, Mexico, and five friends, who are nannies for families in the United States, traveled to New York to secure a coveted spot in one of 35 metal pens where re-entry is prohibited. \"I've always wanted to come to New York, and this is one of the must-dos before you die,\" she said. Laura Ribera, from Bolivia, said people told her she was crazy for coming. \"But we wanted to be in New York,\" she said. \"Even the people in our hotel were asking us why we would go out there. But I feel safe.\" For more than two decades, security has gradually been tightened for the event. Recent deadly truck attacks in Germany and France brought about another security upgrade this year. Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand are blocking off streets leading to the celebration zone. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, are on guard, police said. \"We're well prepared,\" police Commissioner James O'Neill said. \"All New Yorkers should feel safe, especially if you're in Times Square. It is going to be the most protected place in the city.\" This year, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has the honor of pushing the Waterford crystal button that begins a 60-second countdown to 2017. Mariah Carey is the headline performer in Times Square for \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest\" on ABC. Other featured acts include pop-rock band DNCE, country star Thomas Rhett and Gloria Estefan and the cast of her Broadway musical, \"On Your Feet!\" After the crowd leaves, cleanup will be left to a small army of city employees including 235 sanitation workers, 45 police officers and two deputy police chiefs. Last year, the crews removed more than 44 tons of debris. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "\u201cI like to say that you almost can\u2019t overmarket Texas to Texans,\u201d said Fred M. Diaz, a Nissan North America executive and a native Texan. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I met Mr. Diaz at the supreme manifestation of the state\u2019s truck mania: the Texas Truck Rodeo. It is the Oscars for pickup trucks. The auto journalists who make up the Texas Auto Writers Association steer dozens of trucks and S.U.V.s through rocky, muddy off-road trails, critique the vehicles\u2019 appearance and performance, and vote on the winners. There are numerous categories, but the top prize is the Truck of Texas. Each year, the auto writers group blesses a truck brand with the title at the end of the two-day rodeo, and the winner takes out billboards, runs TV and magazine ads, revels in the industry buzz and shows off the sterling silver trophy at car shows and auto plants. \u201cI have seen manufacturers cry when they\u2019ve won \u2014 literally \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen manufacturers cry when they lose,\u201d said Sue Mead, a freelance journalist and member of the auto writers group. Photo Brian Rathsburg of Ford celebrating the selection of the Super Duty as the Truck of Texas. Credit Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times This year\u2019s rodeo, held in October at the Longhorn River Ranch here in Dripping Springs, in the Hill Country outside Austin, left me with a new appreciation for the word truck-a-thon. Mr. Spell, a former president of the auto writers group and a founder of the rodeo in the early 1990s, drove 38 vehicles in 48 hours. At one point, I was at a cocktail social with auto executives sorting through my bag of truck swag (the Ram cup koozies were clever). At another, I was gripping the grab handle inside a Ford F-150 Raptor as it chewed up the countryside when I made the mistake, midbump, of asking the driver how fast we were going. Seth Goslawski, the Ford engineer behind the wheel, had no idea. \u201cLooking at your gauges,\u201d he explained, \u201cgets you in trouble.\u201d I learned later we were doing at least 90 miles per hour. The Nissan Titan XD had been named the Truck of Texas in 2015, and there was a lot of chatter at the rodeo about whether it would repeat, but my stuntman-style ride with Mr. Goslawski gave me a bias toward the Raptor. It kept me alive. I liked it a whole bunch. In 2011, Ms. Mead and her co-driver sped a Raptor 6,000 miles through South America and won their class at the Dakar Rally, the world\u2019s longest, toughest off-road race. I, on the other hand, had trouble making my way back to the hotel in my sedan on Day 1 of the rodeo and smacked into a deer. We both survived, but let\u2019s just say there was some nervousness at the rodeo as I got behind the wheel of a Ram Power Wagon and a Nissan Titan. I was worried about damaging the trucks until Nissan\u2019s Mr. Diaz told me that a rodeo journalist once took an S.U.V. off the off-road and plunged it, purposely, into a river. Indeed, my time on the most rugged hilltop trail was surprisingly luxurious. We could have towed 18,000 pounds, but with our leather-wrapped heated steering wheels, chrome grilles and computer-controlled driving aids, it seemed we were selecting the Yacht of Texas. At the outdoor awards ceremony, everyone gawked at the two-handled Truck of Texas trophy. In the end, it went to the 2017 Ford Super Duty. A mere five voting points separated the Titan from the Super Duty. John Rieger, Ford\u2019s Super Duty brand manager, gave the trophy a long kiss in the glow of the headlights.

    "text": "Court Reinstates Kennedy Cousin Skakel's Murder Conviction By dave collins, associated press HARTFORD, Conn. \u0097 Dec 31, 2016, 2:47 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Thursday, Nov. 21, 2013, file photo, Michael Skakel reacts to being granted bail during his bond hearing at Stamford Superior Court in Stamford, Conn. A divided Connecticut Supreme Court on Friday, Dec. 30, 2016, reinstated Kennedy cousin Skakel's murder conviction in the 1975 killing of Martha Moxley, rejecting a lower court ruling in an appeal that his trial lawyer didn't adequately represent him. (Bob Luckey/Hearst Connecticut Media via AP, Pool, File) 0 Shares Email Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel faces a possible return to prison after the state Supreme Court reinstated his murder conviction in the killing of Martha Moxley in 1975 when they were 15 years old and neighbors in a wealthy enclave. The court issued a 4-3 decision Friday that rejected a lower court's ruling that Skakel's trial lawyer didn't adequately represent him. Justice Peter T. Zarella wrote that the majority of the court concluded Skakel's lawyer \"rendered constitutionally adequate representation.\" It was unclear if Skakel, now 56 years old, will be sent back to prison or allowed to remain free if he appeals or asks the high court to reconsider. His appellate lawyer Hubert Santos said he was reviewing the ruling. Skakel, a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy , was convicted of murder in 2002 and was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison in the killing of Moxley, who was bludgeoned with a golf club, in Greenwich. His cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been a top advocate and this year released a book that argued he's innocent. Skakel was freed in 2013 on $1.2 million bail after a judge granted him a new trial based on claims his trial lawyer, Michael Sherman, made a series of poor decisions in representing him. The judge found Sherman failed to argue that Skakel's brother could have been responsible for the crime and failed to present a key alibi witness for Skakel. Sherman had defended his work. The case has drawn international attention because of the Kennedy name, Skakel's rich family, numerous theories about who killed Moxley and the brutal way in which she died. Several other people, including Skakel's brother Tommy Skakel, have been mentioned as possible killers. Moxley's brother, John Moxley, said he was \"a little shocked\" by Friday's court ruling. \"I think it's the right decision,\" he said. \"It's going to take a while to sink in, but I hope this is the end of it.\" Moxley's mother, Dorthy Moxley, who's in her mid-80s, added, \"This is the way it should be. I am very, very happy. It is sinking in, and I could not be more excited, more pleased.\" Chief State's Attorney Kevin Kane, the state's top prosecutor, didn't return messages seeking comment. The case was considered a big challenge for prosecutors because of issues including the age of the crime and the lack of forensic evidence. Michael Skakel was convicted after a trial that focused on testimony that he confessed or made incriminating statements over the years. During arguments before the state Supreme Court, prosecutor Susann Gill told the justices that Sherman did a competent job investigating and trying the case and that Skakel's appellate lawyers had not met the high burden under case law to prove ineffective counsel. She also stood by the state's position that there was \"substantial\" evidence that Skakel killed Martha Moxley. Santos argued that Sherman made numerous poor decisions, including not focusing on Skakel's brother as a possible suspect. Santos told the justices, \"This defendant did not get a fair shake. The weight of the evidence is that Tommy Skakel killed Martha Moxley.\" Santos also said Michael Skakel had an alibi on the night of the killing at 10 p.m., when he said evidence shows Moxley was killed. He cited testimony that Skakel and some relatives left the neighborhood at about 9:30 p.m. to go to his cousin's house 20 minutes away to watch a Monty Python movie. Santos also said there was no forensic or physical evidence linking Skakel to the killing. Tommy Skakel's attorney has said his client had nothing to do with the slaying. Tommy Skakel was an early suspect in the case because he was the last person seen with Moxley. Santos said Tommy Skakel admitted to investigators hired by his father that he had a sexual encounter with Moxley in which he unbuttoned her jeans and pulled them down between 9:30 and 9:55 p.m. on the night of the killing. Moxley was found dead the next day with her pants pulled down. But prosecutors have said that highlighting Thomas Skakel's relationship with Moxley would have bolstered their argument that Michael Skakel killed her in a jealous rage. 0 Shares ",

Time Medics and security officials work at the scene Jan. 1, 2017, after an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul. (Photo: AP) An assailant believed to be dressed as Santa Claus opened fire in an Istanbul nightclub filled with New Year's Eve revelers early Sunday, killing at least 35 and wounding 40 others,\u00a0authorities said.. The city's governor described the mass shooting as a terror attack, the latest to shake\u00a0Turkey, and it was not immediately clear\u00a0whether one attacker\u00a0or several participated. Gov. Vasip Sahin said the attacker, armed with a long-barreled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the club before entering and firing on people partying inside. He did not say who may have carried out what he called a \"terror attack.\" \"Unfortunately, (he) rained bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people who were there to celebrate New Year's and have fun,\" Sahin told reporters. The White House issued a statement condemning the attack. \"That such an atrocity could be perpetrated upon innocent revelers, many of whom were celebrating New Year's Eve, underscores the savagery of the attackers. We offer our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those killed, and a speedy recovery to the wounded,\" the statement read. Turkish security forces have\u00a0been on particularly high alert in the past weeks. On\u00a0Dec. 20, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was killed while attending an art exhibition. The Russian diplomat, Andrei Karlov, was shot dead by off-duty Turkish policeman Mevlut Mert Altintas as he was giving a speech in Ankara,\u00a0the capital.\u00a0The killer shouted that the murder was in retaliation for Russian involvement in the ongoing conflict in the Syrian city of Aleppo. In the latest attack, media reports say\u00a0the assailant entered the popular Reina nightclub, in Istanbul's Ortakoy district on European side of the Bosphorus River, at 1:45 a.m. local time, eight hours ahead of Eastern Time, dressed in a Santa Claus costume. More than 500 people were inside the club at the time, private NTV television reported. A New York Times\u00a0 report \u00a0suggested the possibility of multiple attackers. Among many tweets posted about the shooting was one from Israel News Online, which included a short, grainy video clip that appeared to show a man wearing a Santa hat clutching what appears to be a weapon.

Footage from the scene outside\u00a0the Reina nightclub showed at least six ambulances with flashing lights and civilians being escorted out. NTV said police had cordoned off the area and an operation to capture the assailant was ongoing. An AP photographer said police cordoned off the area about 2 miles away from the nightclub and reported multiple ambulances passing by. \"This attack is, of course, a horrible development, but not shocking to many Turks who chose to stay inside this New Year's Eve,\" Aykan Erdemir, former member of the Turkish Parliament, told CNN.\u00a0\"Turkey is known to host these big parties to celebrate New Year's. But this year most citizens were wary of Islamist attacks, so they chose to celebrate it at home with their friends.\" He said the attack seemed similar to what happened at the Bataclan, a Paris concert hall that gunmen attacked in 2015. \"This is an attack on the Western lifestyle. This is an attack on Turkey's secular, urban way of living. And this will simply fuel the ongoing cultural clashes, the ongoing polarization in Turkey,\" Erdemir said. Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, state news agency Anadolu reported. Ankara and Istanbul have been targeted by several attacks in 2016 carried out by the Islamic State group or Kurdish rebels, killing more than 180 people.

An overnight manhunt for the suspect ended Saturday morning when police found 32-year-old Jason Robison at an unoccupied mobile home in the area, authorities said. Cpl. Adam Reed, a state police spokesman, said Robison refused orders and threatened officers on the scene, leading police to shoot him. His death was confirmed at about 10:30 a.m. Earlier on Saturday, state police had said on social media that Robison had died. HUNTINGDON COUNTY: UPDATE.   ** Robison is deceased; more information to follow. **  The Pennsylvania State Police is... Posted by PA State Police on\u00a0 Friday, December 30, 2016 Robison had been arrested more than a dozen times in the county, on charges that included making threats, assault, theft and driving on a revoked license. Robison last appeared in court on Dec. 16, when he was released on theft and driving charges after posting $10,000 bail. Details of the complaint that Weaver was responding to when he was shot were not immediately available, and Reed did not immediately know who owned the home where Weaver was killed.\u00a0 Weaver enlisted in the Pennsylvania State Police in December 2015 and was assigned to the Patrol Unit in Troop G in Huntingdon. He\u2019s the 97th member of the Pennsylvania State Police to be killed in the line of duty.\u00a0 Gov. Tom Wolf said in a statement that \u201cLandon will always be remembered for his bravery, his sacrifice, and his willingness to serve.\u201d \u201cTrooper Weaver\u2019s life and service to our commonwealth ended far too soon \u2013 may we never forget his sacrifice,\u201d\u00a0 Wolf said . \u00a0\u00a0 Wolf also commended the Pennsylvania State Police and all law enforcement involved for swiftly ending the manhunt and preventing harm to other residents.\u00a0 \u201cI thank the troopers and their counterparts who worked through the night and put their lives on the line,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

A Wallingford, Connecticut police spokeswoman said that officers responded to reports of shots fired outside the Oakdale Theatre after rapper Meek Mill performed. Officers found two dead and say the other two with non-life-threatening injuries were taken to hospitals. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) 0 Shares Email Four men were shot -- two of them fatally -- outside a Connecticut concert venue where rapper Meek Mill had performed Friday night, police said. Police in the town of Wallingford -- about 14 miles north of New Haven -- said the concert appeared to be winding down when shots were fired outside the Oakdale Theater. Police did not explicitly tie the shooting to the concert or Meek Mill, whose real name is Robert Williams. The two males who survived the shooting have non-life threatening injures and were transported to Hartford Hospital and Yale New Haven Hospital, Wallingford Police Lt. Cheryl Bradley told reporters. Lt. Bradley did not provide any information about the deceased victims. She also said it is unclear if the victims knew each other or what prompted the shooting. As of early Saturday morning, no one was in custody. Lt. Bradley explained, \"We received a 911 call from an employee at the Oakdale Theatre ... The caller reported that he was outside of the Oakdale with a victim who was shot in the leg. Our units responding determined that there were actually 4 victims, 2 with non-life-threatening injuries ... 2 victims determined to be deceased. Everything occurred outside of the Oakdale, it appeared to be near closing, the closing of the event.\" She added, \"At this time, we are looking into possible leads, suspect vehicles, descriptions.\" ABC News' Brendan Rand and Matt Foster contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

By Erin Cunningham and Kareem Fahim January 1 at 9:37 AM Follow @erinmcunningham Follow @kfahim ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkish authorities were hunting for a lone gunman who opened fire on a New Year's celebration early Sunday at one of Istanbul's most popular nightclubs, killing dozens of people, many of them foreigners, and wounding scores more in one of the deadliest attacks on civilians in the city. The victims include an Iraqi architecture student, a Turkish policeman and an Israeli woman celebrating the new year with her friends. At least 39 people were killed and 70 people wounded, and citizens of five other countries were believed to be among the dead, officials said. The assault, which began with a spray of gunfire from a single assailant around 1 a.m., was the latest in a string of deadly attacks that have shaken Turkey as it faces threats both at home and from the civil war next door in Syria. Sunday\u2019s incident was the fourth major attack in Turkey in less than a month, including the high-profile assassination of the Russian ambassador by a Turkish policeman, and a brazen car bomb attack against riot police at a soccer stadium in Istanbul. That attack was claimed by separatist Kurdish militants, who have waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. Officials on Sunday called the nightclub attack a \u201cmassacre\u201d and an act of terrorism. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the attack was meant to \u201ctrigger chaos.\u201d (Haberturk Gazetesi Yildirim) We \u201cwill never give passage to these dirty games,\u201d Erdogan said in a statement posted on the presidency's website. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Solu said the assault on the Reina Club \u2014 a sprawling venue on the edge of the Bosporus strait, popular with Istanbul's elite \u2014 was carried out by a single gunman who has not yet been identified. Speaking to reporters outside an Istanbul hospital, Soylu said the attacker changed clothes to escape the scene. \u201cOur security forces have started the necessary operations\u201d to find the attacker, Soylu said. He said at least 15 of the 20 victims identified were foreign nationals. Later, Turkey's minister of family and social policies said that the victims included Saudi, Moroccan, Lebanese and Libyan citizens. Israel's Foreign Ministry confirmed that one Israeli woman, 19-year-old Leanne Nasser, was killed. Lebanese media also reported that one of its nationals was also confirmed dead. The attack, which targeted a club popular with international clientele, appeared to echo the massacres at Bataclan, a Parisian concert venue, in 2015, and a gay nightclub in Orlando last June. In both cases, one or more gunmen used assault rifles to shoot revelers at cosmopolitan venues in the heart of each city, killing scores from countries around the globe. Those attacks were claimed by the Islamic State. There has been no claim of responsibility, however, for the Istanbul attack. Witnesses and officials described at least one gunman storming the club with a long-barreled rifle, and stampedes of panicked patrons scrambling for cover at the waterside. The assault began when the gunman shot and killed a police officer who was guarding the door, according to Istanbul Mayor Vasip Sahin, who spoke to reporters in front of the club about two hours after the shooting. After killing the policeman, the gunman \u201cbrutally and violently attacked innocent people who came here to enjoy themselves,\u201d Sahin said. Sefa Boydas, a professional soccer player who was at the club, described the scene on Twitter . He said he did not see who was shooting but that the attack happened quickly. Police arrived soon after, he said, and he carried his girlfriend, who was wearing high heels, out of the club to safety. The U.S. Embassy issued a statement Sunday denying reports that the U.S. government had information about threats to specific venues, including Reina. The nightclub's owner, Mehmet Kocarslan, had told the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet that there had been increased security at the club for a week or more, because of warnings from \u201cAmerican intelligence.\u201d \u201cThe U.S. Government did not warn Americans to stay away from specific venues or neighborhoods,\u201d the embassy statement said. Turkey's top cleric and head of the government's presidency for religious affairs, Prof. Mehmet Gormuz, also condemned the shootings Sunday, saying such an attack would be just as heinous if it took place in a mosque. \u201cThe targets of terrorists are not places but the people, the country, the nation, and humanity overall,\u201d Gormuz said in a statement distributed by the prime minister's office. Such an attack, he said, \u201cno Muslim conscience can accept.\u201d The mass killing at the nightclub was at least the fourth major attack in Turkey in less than a month, raising questions about the ability of the government, a NATO member and critical regional ally of the United States, to counter threats stemming from the war across Turkey\u2019s border in Syria, as well as an escalating conflict with Kurdish militants inside Turkey. At least one of the recent assaults \u2014 a suicide bombing at a soccer stadium in central Istanbul \u2014 was claimed by a Kurdish militant group. Authorities are still investigating who might have planned other attacks, including the Dec. 19 assassination of Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey, by a police officer who denounced the carnage in Syria\u2019s civil war. [ Turkish police officer, invoking Aleppo, guns down Russian ambassador in Ankara ] Turkey recently took a central role in trying to halt the hostilities in Syria, in coordination with Russia, which is allied with the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A recent cease-fire announced by Turkey and Russia was endorsed by several Syrian rebel groups but not others, including radical Islamist groups that might seek to retaliate against Erdogan\u2019s government because of its cooperation with Russia. The attacks have come despite a widening security dragnet by authorities and a broad crackdown by the government on those whom officials have branded terrorists. Ned Price, a White House National Security Council spokesman, released a statement condemning the attack. \u201cThat such an atrocity could be perpetrated upon innocent revelers, many of whom were celebrating New Year\u2019s Eve, underscores the savagery of the attackers,\u201d the statement said. President Obama was briefed on the assault and has \u201cdirected his team to offer appropriate assistance to the Turkish authorities,\u201d said Eric Schultz, White House deputy press secretary. At the time of the attack early Sunday, according to local media, hundreds of people were inside the club. Patrons reportedly jumped into the water to escape the gunfire, and dozens of ambulances could be heard heading in the direction of the club in Istanbul\u2019s Ortakoy district. \u201cWe were there, we were having fun, when all of a sudden people started running,\u201d club patron Sinem Uyanik told Hurriyet. Uyanik was waiting outside a hospital, where her husband, who had also been at the club, was being treated for gunshot wounds. \u201cIt was so horrible. It smelled like gunpowder,\u201d Uyanik said. At some point, she fainted, and then \u201cwoke up and saw my husband covered in blood,\u201d she told the paper. \u201cSo many people were covered in blood,\u201d she said. Security forces later stormed the nightclub, Uyanik said. Police in riot gear and armored vehicles blocked the area around the venue, the Associated Press reported. Photos published by the state-run Anadolu news agency showed ambulances lined up outside the building. Turkish authorities issued a temporary gag order on reporting from the scene. The order also barred media outlets from publishing any information on potential suspects, unless released through official statements. Such bans are frequent in Turkey, where the government has embarked on a far-reaching crackdown on the news media . Still, images of the carnage circulated on social media early Sunday. Fahim reported from Cairo. ",

    "text": "NBCUniversal extends deadline, averting a Charter-Spectrum blackout \u2014 for now Charter Spectrum truck Charter cable TV, phone and Internet service is sold under the Spectrum brand. Charter cable TV, phone and Internet service is sold under the Spectrum brand. (Charter Communications) Media giant NBCUniversal has granted an extension in its carriage talks with cable television provider Charter Communications , averting a New Year\u2019s Eve blackout of NBC-owned channels in nearly 16 million homes in the U.S. with Spectrum service. NBCUniversal announced the extension late Saturday afternoon. \u201cNegotiations with Charter Spectrum for the NBCUniversal portfolio of networks have been extended,\u201d NBCUniversal said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to negotiate in good faith so that Charter Spectrum customers can continue to receive NBCUniversal\u2019s valuable networks and we hope to be able to reach a deal.\u201d\u00a0 The current pact was set to expire at 9 p.m. Pacific time. The truce suggests that the two companies are making progress in their efforts to strike a comprehensive carriage deal for more than a dozen NBC channels. NBC declined to specify the length of the extension. NBCUniversal declared an impasse in the contract talks Thursday, but negotiations resumed Friday and continued Saturday. Both companies appear motivated to resolve their differences and hammer out a new deal without an outage of popular TV networks during a long holiday weekend during which\u00a0millions of people are at home watching television. Such a blackout would have affected more than 1.6 million homes with Spectrum\u00a0service in the Los Angeles region. Those customers would have lost coverage of KNBC-TV Channel 4, which is scheduled to televise Sunday\u2019s high-profile NFL match-up between the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions on \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d\u00a0 In addition to KNBC, NBCUniversal owns the Spanish-language Telemundo network and cable channels USA, Syfy, Bravo, E!, NBC Sports, Golf Channel, MSNBC and CNBC.\u00a0 Charter, which declined to comment, is the largest pay-TV\u00a0provider in Los Angeles. The Connecticut company\u00a0acquired Time Warner Cable in May, and rebranded its\u00a0cable TV, phone and broadband Internet service as Spectrum. Contentious carriage contract negotiations have become more common in the media industry. Pay-TV operators face an increasingly fraught environment as more consumers cut\u00a0the cable cord in favor of lower-cost alternatives, such as SlingTV, Netflix and Hulu. Distributors do not want to risk alienating more customers by continuously raising their rates. At\u00a0the same time, media companies such as NBCUniversal have been\u00a0shelling out more money for programming, particularly for sports. NBC, for example, pays the NFL more than $1 billion annually for rights to televise \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and a handful of Thursday night games. Media companies have demanded higher fees from\u00a0distributors to help pay for the programming \u2014 prompting a more tenacious tug\u00a0of\u00a0war between the two sides. NBC executives also have been laboring for years to raise their\u00a0programming fees, which are\u00a0below industry averages.\u00a0When the previous round of deals was\u00a0struck about\u00a0six years ago, NBC was owned by General Electric Co. The NBC broadcast network was in the ratings cellar\u00a0\u2014 in fourth place among the big broadcast networks. NBC\u00a0had less bargaining power than\u00a0rivals such as Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC,\u00a0ESPN and the Disney Channel. Philadelphia cable giant Comcast Corp. \u00a0bought NBCUniversal in 2011. NBC now is a top network and has more leverage in negotiations with pay-TV companies, such as Charter.

The New York Police Department\u2019s special operations division posted a photo of the unusual tourist on its Twitter account Saturday morning. The whale was seen swimming along the shores of Manhattan\u2019s upper East Side, close to Gracie Mansion, where the mayor lives. #Harbor spotted another whale in the E.

A Wallingford police spokeswoman tells the Record Journal that officers responded to reports of shots fired outside the Oakdale Theatre after rapper Meek Mill performed. Officers found two dead and say the other two with non-life-threatening injuries were taken to hospitals. Police haven\u2019t released the names and ages of the four victims. The spokeswoman says no one is in custody. Authorities didn\u2019t immediately release information on suspects or vehicles.\u00a0 The shooting took place not long after 11 p.m. as the concert was letting out, CBS Hartford affiliate WFSB reported . Police said gunfire rang out near the theater in a parking lot adjacent to the venue. The number of shooters remains unclear. Police believe that those involved attended the concert. Meek Mill was not injured and isn\u2019t believed to be connected to those involved.\u00a0 Mill, whose real name is Robert Williams, was recently under house arrest after violating probation for the fourth time in eight years. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story On Thursday, the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia to retaliate against what American intelligence agencies say was the use of cyberattacks to meddle in the presidential election. But while the hacking focused attention on one particularly stealthy, intrusive way of influencing other states, it is just one lever that the Kremlin pulls. Photo Martin Nejedly, center, the chief adviser to Mr. Zeman, with the head of Russian Railways at the time, Vladimir I. Yakunin, left, in Prague last year. Credit Michal Kamaryt/Czech News Agency, via Associated Press The others include disinformation campaigns across a range of Russian-financed media outlets, support for violent fringe groups and even occasional plots against high-profile government critics. And in some cases, experts say, the Kremlin and its allies resort to an old-fashioned but highly effective technique: trying to buy seats at the table of mainstream politics, never sure where or when their support might pay off. One overarching question about Russian influence in Europe is whether President Vladimir V. Putin has just been lucky that some politicians echo his thinking, or whether the Kremlin has manipulated that trend. For many analysts, somewhere between pure luck and outright manipulation lies opportunism, and they call that a Kremlin specialty. \u201cThe Russians systematically fill any open space, and they try to expand it,\u201d said Martin Stropnicky, the Czech defense minister. \u201cThey have years of practice, and they are not in a hurry.\u201d Moscow did not construct public disenchantment with either the European Union or liberal immigration policies, for example, but it exploits such issues, analysts said. The Kremlin seeks to weaken what it considers alliances arrayed against it, like the European Union and NATO, especially as it sees them spreading through its natural sphere of influence in the former Soviet bloc. \u201cEvery country that was successful in moving away from Communism toward an open, prosperous society based on law is a real threat to them,\u201d said Ivan Gabal, deputy chairman of the Security Committee in the Czech Parliament. Advertisement Russia\u2019s funding of political movements or individual politicians is nothing new, analysts say. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, all manner of payments from Moscow came to light, including subsidizing of the antinuclear movement. Photo Mr. Zeman with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the Kremlin in 2015. Credit Sergei Chirikov/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images \u201cThe behavior is so close to Soviet behavior it is ridiculous,\u201d said Martin Kragh, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs in Stockholm. \u201cIt is like they picked up an old handbook and just dusted it off.\u201d Gleb Pavlovsky, a political consultant who served as a Kremlin spin doctor for 15 years before 2011, said the main difference now was that while the Soviet Union had sought out ideological allies, the modern Kremlin looked for anyone who could serve its purposes. \u201cI am certain that they pay a large number of different people,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Kremlin they see this as the normal ways of the market. I think that they always have some money, a line item in the budget, to help in creating advantageous positions.\u201d A Czech Leader\u2019s Path Back As prime minister from 1998 to 2002, Mr. Zeman was the key official in negotiating the Czech Republic\u2019s entrance into the European Union, lauding it as his country\u2019s return to its Western roots. Then he lost a presidential bid in 2003, withdrawing to a remote village and passing summer days floating in a rubber dinghy on a local lake. Most Czechs forgot about him. The Russians did not. He was invited to an annual forum used as a platform to attack Western institutions by Vladimir I. Yakunin, head of Russian Railways and a former Soviet intelligence officer at the United Nations. At least one Russian ambassador dropped in to visit as well, according to several Czech journalists. Mr. Zeman made a comeback in 2013, winning the presidency in a victory partly engineered by Mr. Nejedly, the key financial official for the campaign. Mr. Nejedly remains a shadowy figure \u2014 serving the president as a private adviser, not on the government payroll. He spent most of the 1990s working in Russia, telling one Czech reporter in a rare interview that he promoted Opel cars. He eventually returned to the Czech Republic and in 2007 founded Lukoil Aviation Czech, a Lukoil subsidiary, becoming its general manager. The company won no-bid contracts to supply aviation fuel at several Czech airports, including Prague\u2019s. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the business failed, running up almost $7.5 million in debts, according to commercial records kept by the Prague Municipal Court, including a $1.4 million fine Mr. Nejedly owed to the Czech state over a fuel deal gone sour. The records were first unearthed in November by the MF DNES newspaper. Lukoil liquidated its subsidiary. Court records indicate that Mr. Nejedly, who owned 40 percent of Lukoil Aviation Czech, paid nothing. Fostering ties with energy middlemen who owe their fortunes to Russia and exert considerable political influence is a classic Russian method seen in Germany, Ukraine and other countries. Such links might not be forged by the Kremlin directly, but by individuals or companies seeking to please Mr. Putin. Mr. Nejedly displays his Russian sympathies plainly enough \u2014 a recent picture published in the Czech media showed him holding his cellphone with a picture of Mr. Putin on the back. Relations between Russia and the European Union deteriorated sharply in 2014 after Russian used its military to annex Crimea and to destabilize Ukraine. In the aftermath, Mr. Zeman proved notably friendly toward Russia. He repeatedly criticized Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia, and denied that the Kremlin had deployed troops in Ukraine. The latter prompted Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister at the time, to remark in September of 2014: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the Czech Republic has an intelligence service. It does? Then he should ask them.\u201d Photo Protesters displayed red cards like those that indicate ejection from a soccer game during a protest against Mr. Zeman in 2014. Credit Filip Singer/European Pressphoto Agency Mr. Zeman was among just two or three European Union leaders who attended the May 2015 Victory Day parade in Moscow commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Mr. Putin greeted him warmly. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt is a pleasure to know that there are politicians in Europe who are capable of directly expressing their viewpoint and of asserting and conducting an independent policy,\u201d the Russian president said, according to the Kremlin\u2019s website. Mr. Nejedly, though lacking a Czech government security clearance, was one of just two aides in the meeting, a move Mr. Zeman defended because of Mr. Nejedy\u2019s role as an economic adviser. Since that time, Mr. Zeman has continued backing pro-Kremlin policies. He endorsed the Russian intervention in Syria, and last summer called for a \u201cCzechxit\u201d referendum like the British vote to withdraw from the European Union. Debate Over Influence There is a debate in the Czech Republic over the extent to which the Kremlin influences the president. Some accuse him of accepting Russian money for his campaigns, while others say his statements reflect the sentiments of a public increasingly fed up with the European Union. Then there are those who argue that he has long espoused a role for the Czech Republic as an East-West bridge. Some observers also note that as president, Mr. Zeman has a loud megaphone but little real power. The prime minister and the cabinet, who set policy, have remained staunchly pro-Western. The president\u2019s spokesman, Jiri Ovcacek, said in a text message that he would not respond to questions about alleged Russian influence. Mr. Zeman tends to dismiss his critics, including the press, as \u201cPrague whiners\u201d or \u201cPrague cafe society.\u201d Photo Vagit Alekperov, the head of the Russian oil company Lukoil, told a Czech newspaper years ago that the company was privately owned and entirely independent of Russian politics. Credit Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Mr. Nejedly, reached by telephone, railed briefly about the court fine levied against Lukoil Aviation Czech, before asking to see any questions in writing. He did not answer them. The Russian Embassy also asked for questions in writing and did not respond. Lukoil\u2019s Moscow headquarters said it had liquidated the company and paid off its debts in accordance with Czech law, noting that it had appealed the fine and lost. Mr. Zeman previously denied that Lukoil was among his sponsors, and Vagit Alekperov, head of the company, told a Czech newspaper years ago that Lukoil was privately owned and entirely independent of Russian politics, according to translations from The Fleet Sheet, an English-language news service. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is difficult to prove that the Kremlin buys influence. Even in the rare cases when the payments are obvious, cause and effect are not black and white. Various Czech politicians and analysts argued that President Zeman merely reflected the popular mood at home. Zdenek Ondracek, a member of Parliament for the Communist Party, said many Czechs were nostalgic for the days before 1989, when the Soviet model offered greater stability, income equality and relative ease. \u201cThe socialist state offered its citizens many guarantees, and no one would find themselves facing hardships on their own,\u201d Mr. Ondracek said, wearing a black T-shirt printed with words \u201cI was born in the CSSR,\u201d the old initials for the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. In some cases, old ties may be more potent than any website pumping out false stories, said Mr. Randak, the former intelligence chief. He noted that many such personal links existed from the more than four decades that the Soviet Union controlled Czechoslovakia. Russian businesspeople, journalists and others have longstanding social or commercial ties here, and some undoubtedly work for Russian intelligence, he said. Photo Karel Randak, the former head of the Czech foreign intelligence service, in 2012. He said that Russian businesspeople, journalists and others had longstanding social or commercial ties in the country, and that some undoubtedly worked for Russian intelligence. Credit Czech News Agency, via Associated Press The Russian Embassy also tried to recruit members of the 40,000-strong exile community as agents of influence, setting up the Coordinating Council of the Russian Compatriots in the Czech Republic, according to two Russian leaders of expatriate groups, Alexej N. Kelin, the coordinating council\u2019s former head, and Igor Zolotarev. At first the exiles thought the embassy outreach was to learn how the Czech Republic transitioned away from Communism. \u201cThis illusion disappeared at the time when Putin came to power and the whole interest of Russia in its citizens abroad was treating them as a channel to exercise Russian foreign policy abroad,\u201d said Mr. Zolotarev, the founder of an expatriate group called Russian Tradition. In addition, Prague is teeming with Russian spies. The 2015 annual report by the domestic intelligence service stated that the extraordinary number of Russian diplomats accredited to the embassy here meant many were working as intelligence officers. The number of Russian Embassy diplomats is generally pegged at 120 to 140, compared with about 40 Foreign Service officers for the United States. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Puppet organizations and other Russian operations \u201ccan be used to destabilize or manipulate Czech society or the political environment at any time, if Russia wishes to do so,\u201d the report said. In January, the Interior Ministry will start a Center Against Terrorism and Hybrid Threats meant to expose disinformation and the like. Analysts suspect the Kremlin is the main Russian entity that tries to buy influence, but hardly the only one. Oligarchs and companies are guilty of the same behavior. \u201cA lot of this is not at the direct behest of Putin,\u201d said Alina Polyakova of the Atlantic Council, editor of a recent study on Russian influence in Europe. \u201cThere are individuals who try to seek favoritism, who want to bring something good to the czar.\u201d Hana de Goeij contributed reporting.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The next president may be able to roll back some, or even most, of those actions, a point that Mr. Obama\u2019s top aides concede. But every step the current president takes requires Mr. Trump to overcome one more legislative or procedural hurdle as he seeks to change direction in Washington. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Obama is continuing to fill the ranks of the government with his own appointees; since Election Day, he has named 103 people to senior Civil Service jobs, boards, key commissions and oversight panels, including the National Council on Disability, the Amtrak board of directors, the Holocaust Memorial Council and the boards of visitors at military academies. He is also pushing ahead with his goal of freeing nonviolent drug offenders from federal prisons. In the last few weeks, he has commuted the sentences of 232 federal inmates and pardoned 78 others. And on Wednesday, he will meet with Democratic lawmakers to discuss ways to protect the Affordable Care Act from efforts by Mr. Trump and Republicans to dismantle it. To many conservatives, Mr. Obama is acting out of spite as much as conviction. \u201cHe\u2019s doing all this stuff as his legacy,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, comparing Mr. Obama to a petulant god in a Wagner opera. \u201cIf he goes through three more weeks of this stuff, who is the country going to think is the extremist? Trump or Obama?\u201d White House aides note that many of the president\u2019s last-minute actions were put in motion months or even years before the outcome of the election was clear. And none break from the ideological approach Mr. Obama took during his eight years in office. But they represent a determination by the 44th president to squeeze in every last Obama-era achievement before Mr. Trump \u2014 who has vowed to dismantle those achievements \u2014 takes over. That has cheered some of Mr. Obama\u2019s liberal allies, who wish he could do even more. \u201cThe Republicans are freaking out because all of a sudden Obama is doing a lot of governing,\u201d said Matt Bennett, the senior vice president for public affairs at the Third Way, a liberal think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t like it. I get that. But he\u2019s in his right to do it, and he should do it. Is he trying to box Trump in? You bet \u2014 and he should.\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s actions have not gone unnoticed by Mr. Trump and the people working frantically to assemble the new administration. A day after Mr. Obama allowed passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution criticizing Israeli settlements, Mr. Trump angrily wrote on Twitter that the move would \u201cmake it much harder to negotiate peace.\u201d Mr. Trump added, optimistically: \u201cToo bad, but we will get it done anyway!\u201d Two days later, in a sign of his growing frustration with Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump posted again on Twitter, saying he was doing his best to \u201cdisregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story He continued, \u201cThought it was going to be a smooth transition \u2014 NOT!\u201d That Twitter message apparently prompted a phone call from Mr. Obama the next day, when the president and president-elect tried to re-emphasize their cooperation. Mr. Obama\u2019s spokesman issued a statement calling the discussion positive, saying both men had pledged to \u201cwork together to effectuate a smooth transition of power on January 20th.\u201d That evening, from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Mr. Trump insisted that the transition was going \u201cvery, very smoothly\u201d and said his talk with Mr. Obama had been a \u201cvery, very nice\u201d conversation. \u201cOur staffs have been getting along very well, and I\u2019m getting along very well with him other than a couple of statements that I responded to,\u201d Mr. Trump said. White House officials are quick to insist that Mr. Obama has ordered all levels of government to cooperate fully with Mr. Trump on the mechanics of the transition. That directive stands, they said, regardless of the ideological gulf that divides the two men. Nonetheless, it is not uncommon for a departing president to take actions in the waning days of his administration that limit the options for a successor from the other party. In mid-December 2008, President George W. Bush signed a multiyear status-of-forces agreement with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of Iraq that called for all American troops to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. Concerns about security and instability in Iraq in 2011 led the Obama administration into talks with Iraqi leaders to leave some American forces beyond the deadline, but the negotiations broke down and Mr. Obama ended up following the timeline he had inherited from Mr. Bush. \u201cTalk about tying your successor\u2019s hands,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cBush was fully within his rights and powers. These are big, very important matters of national security and foreign policy. We have one president at a time. He\u2019s got to act like the president.\u201d Something similar transpired with the actions Mr. Obama took this past week at the United Nations. By abstaining on the settlement resolution, the United States paved the way for its approval. Conservatives viewed the president\u2019s actions with disdain. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cObama and John Kerry are like tenants who trash a place as they are being evicted,\u201d Erick Erickson, the author of a prominent conservative website, said on Twitter. Mr. Obama\u2019s most permanent action may be his order banning oil drilling off the Atlantic coast, a decision rooted in a 1953 law that experts say will be legally difficult for Mr. Trump to reverse. Environmental groups and other liberal advocacy organizations are hoping for more such moves by Mr. Obama, up until his last moments in office. \u201cThe Constitution lays out that the president is president to Jan. 20 at noon,\u201d said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. Ms. Tanden said Mr. Obama\u2019s actions were bolstered by approval ratings significantly higher than Mr. Trump\u2019s, a historical oddity. Most modern incoming presidents bask in the glow of postelection polling, while those leaving the White House have worn out their welcome. Mr. Obama is \u201cappropriately reading that as full steam ahead,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cThe president rightly sees that the American people are supporting the actions he is taking.\u201d White House officials said Mr. Obama would continue to take actions he deemed necessary until Mr. Trump was sworn in. \u201cThe president is dedicated to using each of his remaining days in office to build on and solidify\u201d his policies, said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman. But officials also say Mr. Obama is unlikely to satisfy the demands of liberal activists who want him to go even further. In a news conference in mid-December, Mr. Obama noted that tension in his late-term responsibilities in response to a question about the violence in Syria. \u201cI will help President Trump \u2014 President-elect Trump \u2014 with any advice, counsel, information that we can provide so that he, once he\u2019s sworn in, can make a decision,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters. \u201cBetween now and then, these are decisions that I have to make based on the consultations I have with our military and the people who have been working this every single day.\u201d Shortly after the news conference, Mr. Obama headed to Hawaii for his last vacation there as president.

    "text": "New Year's Eve will find Margaret Mead in Switzerland, Arthur Murray in Honolulu, Carmine Lombardozzi in jail, Charles Atlas in Brooklyn and Malcolm X in Queens\u2014with\u00adout a drink. \u201cI shall stay home contem\u00adplating some of the disasters ahead in 1965,\u201d Malcolm X said yesterday. Charles Buckley has no plans for tonight. Neither does Clay Blair, the editor who led the revolt this year on The Satur\u00adday Evening Post. Neither does Traffic Commissioner Henry Barnes, who \u201cwill take a pill and go to bed early.\u201d But most New Yorkers \u2014despite the shortage of taxi\u00adcabs, despite the desperate gaiety of the evening \u2014 plan to be in the middle of some noisy scene come midnight. Cleveland Amory, in fact, has received invitations to 13 parties tonight. They include the Milton Caniffs', the Howard Lindsays', the Clyde Newhouses', the Robert Gardiners', the Vincent Prices' (in California), and also parties at Delmonico's, the Plaza, the St. Regis and the Sheraton\u2010East. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The hosts and hostesses at the Sheraton\u2010East will include Mr. and Mrs. Huntington Hart\u00adford, Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Pier\u00adpont 3d, Mr. and Mrs. Theodore L. Cross\u2014and a. live baby pink elephant wearing diapers and representing the New Year. It is not known precisely where Mayor Wagner will spend New Year's Eve, although five hosts say he will be at their parties, and there is a chance\u2014if the Mayor attends the Town Club party at the Wal\u00addorf\u2010Astoria\u2014that he'll run into Carmine G. De Sapio. But not if he can help it. Mr. De Sapio has received about four invitations for to\u00adnight's parties, his wife says. Yogi Berra, who was dropped as Yankee manager this year, has received one invitation. He has accepted. He did not dis\u00adclose the name of the host, but it is not Whitey Ford\u2014who did not invite him. Mrs. Ford, who plans a party in Great Neck for 30 guests, said none of them are ball players. \u201cWe see ball players during the season,\u201d she ex\u00adplained yesterday. It should be a mild, clear evening tonight, according to the Weather Bureau. It is esti\u00admated that 1.5 million cars carrying more than 4.5 million people will be moving this way and that through the metro\u00adpolitan New York area, and Toots Shor's (which has a park\u00ading lot inside) boasts that it is the only place where it is pos\u00adsible to have a drink and smash up a car without leaving the premises. Free coffee will be given to motorists departing tonight from two midtown garages operated by the Kinney System; free coffee will be served motorists along the New York State Thruway (paid for by seven oil companies and four restaurants), and a \u201changover clinic\u201d will be set up tomorrow at Longchamps Restaurant at Madison Avenue and 49th Street. The clinic is under the super\u00advision of the Physician's Wine Appreciation Society of New York, which is composed of 200 From 1 to 4 P.M., Dr. Gould said, members of the society will be served a hangover \u201ccure,\u201d a French 75 made with three ounces of French champagne and one ounce of cognac. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cChampagne and cognac, when mixed together, are known throughout the civilized world for their effect in helping re\u00adstore energy and vigor and in combating indications of melan\u00adcholy and depression,\u201d Dr. Gould said. \u201cJust the thing for New Year's day.\u201d The party in Brooklyn being thrown by the muscle\u2010builder Charles Atlas will be without alcohol. It will feature carrot juice, and other sober sippings. Twenty people are expected to attend\u2014200 less than the crowij expected to attend an alcoholic affair at the Actors Studift given by Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It is a $100\u2010a plate Actors Studio benefit dinner party with entertain\u2010ment by Judy Garland and her, daughter, Liza Minelli. As usual, the ball\u2010lowering ceremony will take place in Times Square starting 45 sec\u2010onds before midnight atop the Allied Chemical Tower (former\u2010ly the Times Tower). Dance halls may be swinging, all night\u2014provided their pro\u00adprietors have obtained special permits from City License Com\u2010missioner Joseph C. DiCarlo. Alternate\u2010side\u2010of\u2010the \u2010 street\u2010parking rules will not be en\u2010forced tomorrow, New Year's Day. This article can be viewed in its original form .

The twin attacks hit al-Sinak, a busy market selling car accessories, food and clothes as well as agricultural seeds and machinery. Minutes after the first suicide bomber detonated his explosives-laden belt, the second one struck amid the crowd that gathered, according to the officials. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks in al-Sanak in a statement posted by its Aamaq news agency, confirming that the blasts came from a pair of suicide bombers. Later on Saturday, three separate attacks in and around Baghdad killed eight people and wounded 17. Those killed included one policeman. 0 Shares ",

The infected laptop is not connected to the Burlington Electric Department's electricity grid systems, the municipal utility said in a statement. \"We took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alerted federal officials of this finding,\" the statement said. \"Our team is working with federal officials to trace this malware and prevent any other attempts to infiltrate utility systems.\" Cars pass by the headquarters of the Russian spy agency FSB, grey building at center, in downtown Moscow, Russia. Alexander Zemlianichenko / AP The Washington Post reported earlier Friday that the code associated with Grizzly Steppe had been detected in a Vermont utility. The newspaper cited a senior Obama administration official among its sources. The intent is not clear, but the discovery raised fears about the vulnerabilities of U.S. electric grid to cyber-attacks and whether the code is in other systems, a U.S. official told the newspaper. The Department of Homeland Security is investigating the incident. \"While our analysis continues, we currently have no information that indicates that the power grid was penetrated in this cyber incident,\" said Todd Breasseale, department assistant secretary for public affairs. Related: Trump Says Putin 'Smart' for Not Retaliating Over U.S. Sanctions Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin said he was outraged at what he called the attempted hacking of the electric grid and called on the federal government to ensure it does not happen again. \"Vermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world's leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality-of-life, economy, health, and safety,\" Shumlin said in a statement. \"This episode should highlight the urgent need for our federal government to vigorously pursue and put an end to this sort of Russian meddling,\" Shumlin, a Democrat, said.

    "text": "AP December 31, 2016, 4:49 PM Pilot fired in Indonesia after alleged attempt to fly drunk Footage appears to show a pilot stumbling through security. Email JAKARTA, Indonesia -- An Indonesian budget airline has fired a pilot suspected of trying to fly a plane while he was drunk, and two of its executives are resigning. Citilink President Director Albert Burhan announced Friday that he and the airline\u2019s production director would resign over the impropriety. Citilink is a subsidiary of national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia. Passengers became suspicious when they heard slurred words and unclear announcements from the cockpit. Some of them left the plane and asked for a replacement of the pilot they believed to be either drunk or under drug influence. Citilink assigned a new pilot to fly the Airbus A320 about an hour behind schedule. The flight had 154 passengers but a number reportedly decided to cancel. The flight on Wednesday was heading from Surabaya, Indonesia\u2019s second-largest city, to the capital, Jakarta. Aviation is a main mode of travel in the sprawling nation of 17,000 islands, and the incident has raised safety concerns. Footage posted on YouTube showed the pilot appearing to stagger through a metal detector at a security checkpoint. Security guards picked up his belongings that were falling on the floor as he seemed out of control.\u00a0 \u201cThe pilot had committed serious violation of standard operation procedure that endangered passengers,\u201d Burhan said. \u201cWe apologize for the discomfort. I have to be responsible for that and therefore I and my production director resign.\u201d The airline previously had dismissed reports that the 32-year-old pilot Tekad Purna was drunk, saying initial tests of drug and alcohol were negative. Director General of Air Transportation Suprasetyo has asked Citilink to make sure the pilot underwent a medical check. Purna is under investigation for possible drunkenness or drug use. Minister of Transportation Budi Karya has banned him from flying pending the outcome of the investigation. If proven, his license would be revoked. In December last year, three crew members - a pilot and two flight attendants were arrested for allegedly consuming crystal methamphetamine, known locally as shabu-shabu, at a hotel.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Donald Trump's newest branding endeavor: the economy Donald Trump President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters Wednesday in Palm Beach, Fla. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters Wednesday in Palm Beach, Fla. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Michael A. Memoli Contact Reporter Throughout his campaign for president, Donald Trump painted a gloomy picture of the American economy, scoffing at employment data that he said masked the truth. \u201cOur jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby,\u201d the Republican said at an election-day\u00a0rally\u00a0in Michigan, lamenting how he saw global competitors like China outmaneuvering\u00a0the U.S. economically. \u201cThey take our money. They take our jobs. They build their plants. They build their factories. We end up with unemployment and drugs.\u201d But his stunning election win seemed to change his \u2014 \u00a0and to some extent the public\u2019s \u2014 outlook.\u00a0The media-conscious president-elect has quickly adopted a role as the greatest cheerleader for an economy that was already on the rebound. \u201cThe U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points,\u201d Trump crowed in a tweet this week, noting in all caps that it reached a 15-year high. He added, with characteristic immodesty: \u201cThanks Donald!\u201d Donning the mantle of economic optimist is a time-honored tradition for presidents, who are seen as perhaps the most singularly influential person over the economy. Trump\u2019s outlook, however, is notable for the reversal from the campaign\u00a0and for his promotion of the unproven assertion that he himself is having a\u00a0positive influence on the economy, even before he takes office.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s been a bounce in sentiment since the election,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cNow, is that because he won the election or just because people are happy the election\u2019s over? That\u2019s impossible to know.\u201d The statistics Trump touts fit well into his view of a world divided into who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down, winners\u00a0and losers. In place of the\u00a0daily trickle of state and national political polls that dominated his campaign remarks, he has turned to the Consumer Confidence Index as well as the daily stock market closings for what he sees as his successes.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Like he did with polls, Trump has cherry-picked economic data.\u00a0The Consumer Confidence Index did not suddenly rise\u00a0after Trump\u2019s election; it\u00a0has, like other indicators, trended upward since bottoming out shortly after the 2008 economic collapse. Its first major spike came shortly after the inauguration of President Obama , and saw a similar uptick after his reelection in 2012. Additionally, it is a volatile index, subject to negative pressure from political circumstance as well \u2014\u00a0most notably a 2011 battle over raising the nation\u2019s debt limit that pushed the country to the brink of a historic default. And another key part of his economic message, the touting of new jobs\u00a0as if he were\u00a0singularly responsible for their creation, ignores that they usually resulted instead from efforts already underway. On Wednesday, he trumpeted news that telecom company Sprint and technology start-up OneWeb would hire a total of 8,000 workers in the U.S. \u2014 \u00a0calling it \"very good news\" for the economy.\u00a0 But OneWeb, which is building a network of satellites to deliver high-speed Internet access,\u00a0 said nine days earlier \u00a0that it expected to create\u00a0nearly 3,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next four years after securing $1.2 billion in funding, mostly from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.\u00a0And the head of\u00a0SoftBank, which owns Sprint, had said on Dec. 6 that the company\u00a0 had agreed to invest \u00a0$50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 jobs here. Earlier, Trump assumed credit for Carrier Corp.\u2019s decision\u00a0to keep a portion of its workforce in the state in return for state economic incentives and an agreement to hold off on potential new import tariffs on its goods. The chief executive of Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies, said conversations with Trump had helped spur the deal. At an event in Iowa this month during his a thank-you tour, Trump touted the Carrier deal and said he\u2019s been calling chief executives of other companies who have planned to outsource jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great success. You\u2019ll be seeing a lot more success,\u201d he told the crowd. But by tying himself so closely to any economic good news, Trump risks bearing the blame for any downturn. Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who has conducted numerous surveys and focus groups since the election, said he has been struck by the changing attitude of Trump voters toward the economy. \u201cIf you were a Trump voter, you really felt America was going to hell, and you were very skeptical that anything could be done to stop it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re still skeptical now. But you believe that things have begun to turn around.\u00a0It\u2019s like the rainbow after the storm. Everything\u2019s still wet. But you know that something better\u2019s coming.\u201d That puts pressure on Trump ultimately to deliver tangible results, Luntz added, but he says his supporters likely will give him time. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give the impression that they think happy days are here again. Because they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they think now that someone is listening.\u201d Trump\u2019s boosterism is a marked contrast with Obama\u2019s more theoretical and analytical approach, said\u00a0Matt McDonald, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and a Republican strategist. \u201cThe working-class voters who rallied behind him, this is what they want to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to see someone fighting not for a good policy environment where business can create jobs;\u00a0they wanted someone fighting for their job at their factory more concretely.\u201d ",

By David Filipov December 31 at 4:45 PM Follow @davidfilipov MOSCOW \u2014 In a New Year\u2019s address that came off like a victory lap, Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked his country Saturday in the wake of a wildly successful 2016 that saw the Kremlin leader shore up Russia\u2019s standing abroad and acquire a host of powerful geopolitical friends. Putin heads into 2017 on a strong note, having brokered a cease-fire in Syria that sidelined the United States and having won the praise of President-elect \u00adDonald Trump by declining to retaliate in response to the Obama administration\u2019s decision to punish Moscow over its alleged interference in the U.S. election. \u201cWe are working, and working successfully, and we are achieving much,\ufffd? Putin said in the nationally broadcast address. \u201cI would like to thank you for the victories and achievements, for your understanding and trust, and for your true, sincere care for Russia.\ufffd? [ Putin says he won\u2019t deport U.S. diplomats as he looks to cultivate relations with Trump ] Putin is as popular as ever at home, and his stature abroad has been bolstered by Russia\u2019s leading role in the Syrian peace process, the rise in countries in the Western alliance of nationalists who favor better ties with Moscow, and the impression that the Kremlin can tip elections with its hackers, trolls and political spin machines. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Even at the height of the Soviet Union\u2019s power, the notion that Moscow could intervene in a U.S. presidential election to try to influence the outcome was something reserved for Cold War fantasy; now, the CIA says it just happened. It might be tempting to look at the list of victories in Putin\u2019s ledger over the past 12 months and assume that nothing can stop the Kremlin. But Russia is not the Soviet Union, this is not the Cold War, and Moscow is not looking for world domination. Putin\u2019s goal is limited to reducing U.S. influence while ensuring Russia\u2019s vital interests, and the power he can project is still limited by a weak economy and a global reach that pales in comparison to that of the United States. He can\u2019t act anywhere he wants, he can\u2019t do it alone, and a lot still depends on whether and how far President-elect Donald Trump decides to go along with him. [ Trump and Putin: A relationship where mutual admiration is headed toward reality ] For the moment, Trump is coming off as a closer friend to the erstwhile Russian adversary than the political establishment he is about to head up in Washington, as evidenced by the tweet of approval the president-elect sent over the way Putin handled the Obama administration\u2019s sanctions. \u201cPutin is trying to articulate new rules for the world with a little help from Western troublemakers,\ufffd? said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cBut economically, Russia is still very weak, and politically, it is fragile.\ufffd? Indeed, Russia is a poorer country than it was three years ago, when Putin took on the West in the conflict in Ukraine. According to figures published in the Moscow Times , Russia\u2019s gross domestic product reached a peak of $2.2\u00a0trillion in 2013 and has since declined to $1.3\u00a0trillion, lower than Italy, Brazil, and Canada, while the per capita gross domestic product is below $9,000, according to the International Monetary Fund . The country remains dependent on the export of natural resources; structural reform of the economy and privatization of state industry has stalled . The percentage of Russians who had any savings fell from 72\u00a0percent in 2013 to 27\u00a0percent in 2016, according to a year-end analysis published on gazeta.ru . For the first time in seven years, Russians are spending more than half their money on groceries. \u201cPutin has one Russia; many Russians have another. The two don\u2019t really intersect much,\ufffd? observed Alexei Gusarov, who hosts a talk show on Ekho Moskvy radio. Why does this matter? Because all of Russia\u2019s power moves, at the moment, depend entirely on Putin, because the Russian president has so effectively consolidated power. \u201cIn Russia, only one individual decides what is in Russia\u2019s national interest and what is not. There is no institutional or public input to take into account,\ufffd? commented Vladi\u00admir Frolov, a Moscow-based political analyst. Putin\u2019s decision-making has kept his popularity rating in the 80s for months on end, according to the Levada Center . But just 53\u00a0percent of Russians think the country is headed in the right direction. Putin looks poised to win reelection in 2018, should he decide to run, but it remains to be seen whether increased economic pain will erode that certainty. [ Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s grand inquisitor and \u2018fixer-in-chief\u2019 ] Meanwhile, Putin\u2019s ship of state sails on, and much like that undersize, smoke-belching aircraft carrier that changed the balance of power in Syria, its success depends on other countries letting it be successful. Putin has succeeded because he only picks fights with the United States when Russian vital interests are stake and Russia has a reasonable chance of prevailing, said Simon Saradzhyan, founding director of the Russia Matters Project at Harvard\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Saradzhyan argues that the primary consideration here is whether the\u00a0United States is willing to commit its full might: In Ukraine, U.S. vital interests were not at stake, and ultimately, he said, the Obama administration decided they were not in Syria, either. \u201cSoviet leaders sought to counter the United States everywhere and anywhere,\ufffd? Saradzhyan said. \u201cPutin has a much more limited outlook shaped by capacities of his country\u2019s economy, demographics and other components of national might.\ufffd? Putin said as much at his nationally broadcast annual news conference, when he responded to Trump\u2019s call to expand the U.S. nuclear arsenal by saying that Russia\u2019s upgrades were intended to overcome any aggressor but not to enter into an arms race \u201cthat we cannot afford.\ufffd? Not long ago, Russian defense officials floated the idea of restoring Soviet-era bases in Cuba and Vietnam to go along with the newly acquired foothold in Syria. That went nowhere fast. Even as Putin steams into 2017 at the height of his power, the question is what happens to Russia\u2019s standing the moment Trump takes control of the world\u2019s most powerful nation. While Moscow is likely to continue to push to expand its influence where it can at the expense of the United States, co-opting the new administration \u2014 for example, in the fight against terrorism \u2014 wherever it is feasible, Putin is unlikely to act in a way that openly challenges the new U.S. president. \u201cI think Moscow\u2019s expectation of Trump is that he would hit back hard enough to hurt Russia and thus it is better not to goad him unnecessarily,\ufffd? Frolov said. Read more\u00a0 ",

State Department officials block the entrance to a Russian compound Dec. 29, 2016, near Centreville, Md. (Brian Witte / Associated Press) Matt Pearce Contact Reporter It wouldn\u2019t be a bad opening for a Tom Clancy novel about the Cold War: Without warning, American agents descended\u00a0on a Russian-owned compound in rural Maryland. A similar surprise unfolds at\u00a0an estate on New York\u2019s Long Island. Both\u00a0locations are accused of\u00a0hosting Russian spies on American soil, and once again, two nuclear powers stand at each other\u2019s throats. Except there\u2019s no need to dramatize, nor any need to set the story in the past. All this happened Thursday, as\u00a0American officials punished the Russian government on allegations of hacking Democratic officials to influence the recent presidential election. The measures ordered by President Obama included the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomatic officials accused of working as intelligence officers, plus sanctions against Russian cyberagents and firms accused of supporting hacking of the Democratic National Committee. But it\u2019s\u00a0Obama\u2019s order to shut down two Russian-owned mansions \u2014 best known as quiet getaways for diplomatic apparatchiks \u2014 \u00a0that has\u00a0raised eyebrows the most. Russian compound in Centreville, Md. Michael Robinson Chavez / Washington Post A no-trespassing sign stands at the entrance to the road leading to a Russian diplomatic compound outside Centreville, Md. A no-trespassing sign stands at the entrance to the road leading to a Russian diplomatic compound outside Centreville, Md. (Michael Robinson Chavez / Washington Post) On Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, about 60 miles east of the nation\u2019s capital, a three-story, red-brick mansion and almost a dozen cottages\u00a0sit\u00a0on the banks of the Corsica River. The Soviet Union bought the property in 1972 and transferred it to the Russian Federation in the 1990s, and the\u00a045-acre compound also holds tennis courts, a swimming pool and playground equipment.\u00a0It\u2019s mostly known to the local community of Centreville for hosting parties and sailing regattas on Labor Day,\u00a0if it\u2019s known at all. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know they were here, you wouldn\u2019t know they were here,\u201d said George Sigler, president of Centreville\u2019s town council and a retired Marine, describing the compound as a place where Russians working in the embassy in Washington\u00a0could \u201ccome to let their hair down and relax.\u201d The ordered shutdown of the compound caught Sigler by surprise. He had never recalled hearing of anything suspicious happening there, nor of Russian guests misbehaving in the community, where they would shop, eat, get haircuts and buy groceries and alcohol; one local liquor store had stocked up on vodka to serve Russian customers. Sigler recalled visiting the property for a Labor Day picnic last year and \u201cdrinking copious amounts of Russian vodka.\u201d Sigler said he mentioned to the Russian ambassador that he didn\u2019t think he could\u00a0get vodka like that in the U.S.\u00a0The next day, a Russian aide arrived at Centreville City Hall with a couple of bottles. \u201cThey\u2019re good neighbors, and have been\u00a0the whole time they\u2019ve been there,\u201d Sigler said. After Obama ordered the compounds closed Thursday, a woman who flashed an FBI badge and a man who said he worked for the State Department shooed people away from the Maryland property, the Baltimore Sun reported. A 14-acre property in Upper Brookville, Long Island, was also ordered closed. Russia compound on Long Island Alexander F.

A fence encloses an estate in the village of Upper Brookville on Long Island, Dec. 30, 2016. The Obama administration closed this compound for Russian diplomats in retaliation for spying and cyber-meddling in the U.S. presidential election. (Alexander F. Yuan / AP) At a news briefing , Obama administration\u00a0officials did not give details on what kind of spying allegedly happened at the compounds in Maryland and Long Island, except that they \u201cwere used for intelligence collection activities\u201d as well as for recreation. (Part of the administration\u2019s justification for the mansion closures included complaints that U.S. diplomats were being harassed and mistreated in Russia.) Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin complained that the sites were popular getaways for diplomats\u2019 families. \"I think it's quite scandalous that they chose to throw out our kids,\" Churkin said, according to The Associated Press. \"They know full well that those two facilities they mentioned, they are vacation facilities for our kids, and this is Christmas, and this is vacation time for our schools. This is the time when the kids go to those facilities. So to close our access to them just while those holidays were starting, to me was rather silly.\" During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet Union restricted the movements of each others\u2019 visiting diplomats, requiring them to stick to certain parts of the countries. A\u00a0high-ranking Soviet defector, the diplomat Arkady N. Shevchenko,\u00a0said at least one of the Russian-owned\u00a0mansions on Long Island served double duty as electronic surveillance posts for the Soviet Union\u2019s intelligence agency, the KGB. \u201cWhen I first came to the United States in 1958, there were three or four KGB communications technicians and their gear sharing the former servants' quarters in the attic,\u201d\u00a0Shevchenko wrote of the Soviets\u2019 Killenworth mansion on Long Island\u00a0in a 1985 memoir, \u201cBreaking with Moscow.\u201d Rusian compound in Glen Cove, N.Y.

Killenworth is an estate in Glen Cove, N.Y., built in 1913 for George du Pont Pratt and purchased by the former Soviet Union in 1951. (Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / AFP/Getty Images) \u201cBy 1973, the specialists in intercepting radio signals numbered at least a dozen, and they had taken over the whole floor,\u201d wrote Shevchenko.\u00a0\u201cTheir equipment occupied so much space, in fact, that one of the two large unused greenhouses had been commandeered to store it. These quarters were off limits to other personnel.\u201d Shevchenko, who died in 1998,\u00a0also told the Norwich Bulletin newspaper that the Soviets were pleased after buying the Maryland compound in 1972 and added that the property\u2019s location\u00a0was \u201cnot accidental.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI'm not privy to the details, but I remember how happy they were when they bought this estate,\u201d\u00a0 Shevchenko reportedly said . If there was spying going on in Maryland, it may have gone both ways. Soviet officials once complained to U.S. officials\u00a0 that they found a special cable and a special device attached to the compound\u2019s internal phone system in 1977. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the sanctions package \u201cprovocative and\u00a0aimed at\u00a0further weakening the\u00a0Russia-U.S. relationship.\u201d But this was not the same old Cold War story.\u00a0While Putin\u2019s foreign\u00a0minister\u00a0had called for Russia to expel an equal number of American diplomats and close their dacha outside Moscow in addition to another facility,\u00a0Putin\u00a0said he would not retaliate, instead hoping to \u201crestore Russian-U.S. relations based on\u00a0the\u00a0policies of\u00a0the\u00a0 Trump administration.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump responded by pinning a congratulatory tweet to the top of his Twitter page: \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!\u201d The Russian embassy in the U.S., in turn, retweeted\u00a0Trump\u2019s message. In Centreville, Md., comments on the residents\u2019 Facebook page were mostly critical of Obama\u2019s decision to shut down the Russian compound, according to Sigler, who also had his doubts about the spying claims. \u201cWere they spying on anybody? I wouldn\u2019t know why. It\u2019s just a sleepy little town on a sleepy little river,\u201d Sigler said, adding,\u00a0\u201cOnce this all blows over, they\u2019ll probably come back.\u201d ",

This drives me. Perhaps I am addicted to it. . . . The field work gives me this chance or opportunity to \u2018reset\u2019 and take a new look at what I thought I knew or I knew I did not understand.\u201d Keith Nicholls, left, and Andreas Muenchow look out of the helicopter to check the condition of equipment they had installed a year earlier. Nicholls, meanwhile, is an expert in his own sort of extreme pursuit \u2014 using hot water to drill holes hundreds of feet through the enormous ice shelves of Antarctica and now Greenland, and then analyzing data from the ocean beneath them. They first worked together in 2015 as part of a major National Science Foundation-sponsored ship voyage to Petermann, where Muenchow was taking ocean measurements and Nicholls was busy drilling through the ice. Now, they had returned as part of a much smaller mission to recover data and determine why their instruments had gone dead. Two Washington Post journalists accompanied them with the support of the foundation which, in keeping with its policies, provided transportation and accommodations. Their expedition began a day earlier from the United States\u2019 Thule Air Base and the small village of Qaanaaq, Greenland\u2019s most northern permanent settlement. This time they sought to reach Petermann by helicopter. The 300-mile journey was so long they had to break it in stages, picking up fuel from caches they strategically placed a year earlier when they had visited aboard a foundation-supported icebreaker. A deep gulley with rushing water feeds into a river on Petermann Glacier. The shelf has reached a record low size after losing pieces larger than Manhattan in recent years..                                                                            (Whitney Shefte / The Washington Post) CHAPTER 2 The data stopped coming As they crossed the desolate landscape, their Air Greenland chopper finally emerged from a series of inland canyons into the air above the ice shelf, which was streaked with thick veins of blue ice amid a sea of white, the landscape covered with meltwater pools. It was as though a fly had suddenly buzzed in through the window of a cathedral. The ice shelf was its sprawling floor, and it was rimmed on either side by enormous, symmetrical mountain walls sculpted into shapes resembling flying buttresses. Along the shelf\u2019s central aisle ran one of Petermann\u2019s most distinctive features \u2014 a 30-mile-long meltwater river. A year ago, Muenchow and Nicholls had established three scientific data-collection stations on its banks \u2014 drilling through the football-field-thick ice and extending ocean sensors, attached to a long cable, into the dark and half-mile-deep waters beneath the shelf. These were to detect whether warming ocean water was causing a double-whammy of damage to Petermann by melting it from below, even as the warm air temperatures melt it from above. But the main station had stopped feeding back any data in February. Now, Muenchow and Nicholls were here to see what had happened. Muenchow sat in the second row of seats in the helicopter with earphones on to muffle the noise. His chief fear, he had explained before the trip, was that this might just be a mop-up mission: That the flowing ice might have damaged the stations beyond repair, snapping the cables extending into the ocean below, and that there would be no data to retrieve. Muenchow said he had prepared himself to be devastated if the data was lost. But he said he would give himself about \u201c15 minutes\u201d to mourn before adjusting to see what could be salvaged. Watching the shelf shrink CHAPTER 3 Opinion evolves with evidence As nervous as he was about their equipment, Muenchow was much more in his element here than he had been in 2010, testifying before Congress. Then, Muenchow\u2019s scientific caution and compunction for rigor didn\u2019t translate very well for a political audience. Petermann glacier had just lost a chunk of its ice shelf, and NASA satellite images of the enormous ice \u201cisland\u201d were circulating widely. At the hearing, Jay Inslee (D), then a congressman and now the governor of Washington, pressed Muenchow to be more outspoken about what was happening to the planet. The scientist demurred. The evidence \u201cdoes not conclusively prove that this specific event is global warming,\u201d Muenchow testified. The logic was simple \u2014 breaking off large pieces might just be something Petermann glacier does occasionally, if you go back far enough in time. But two years later, another vast island of ice cleaved from Petermann. That\u2019s when Muenchow began to change his mind. The shelf had by then lost 23 miles of its prior length, reaching a record low in size. \u201cIt\u2019s two extreme events in six years, so something is happening,\u201d Muenchow said. In science \u2014 unlike in politics \u2014 being hesitant when you don\u2019t know something, and being willing to change your mind in the face of new evidence, are virtues. He has since joined a growing wave of researchers working to learn more. Climate change doubters have continued to suggest \u2014 from a distance \u2014 that Petermann\u2019s huge ice losses are just normal glacier behavior. Muenchow himself, no dogmatist about the matter, can still entertain the case for skepticism, in part because the glacier has never been as well observed as it now, by scientists and satellites. Conceivably, it lost as much ice during previous periods as it has lost in the present. Muenchow doubts that \u2013 the idea that the glacier has shifted to a new state, he says, is supported by the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d Petermann is looking suspicious again: At its front edge near the ocean, it features several additional cracks, including one that penetrates further toward the center than the others, arcing inward toward the central river and the shelf\u2019s thinnest region. \u201cI already see the beginning of a third break-up,\u201d Muenchow said. Cross section of Petermann Glacier Grounding Ocean water Diagram is schematic Scientists hope temperature data collected underneath the shelf will help determine if warm waters are a bigger threat to the glacier than the rising air temperatures that are driving Petermann\u2019s surface melt.

AP hide caption toggle caption AP Several previous cease-fires have collapsed after a matter of days,\u0080\u0094 but there is hope that this one will hold. On Saturday the U.N. Security Council supported the efforts by Russia and Turkey to end the violence. AP The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Saturday in support of the efforts by Russia and Turkey to end the violence in Syria and \"jump-start\" a political process. The resolution also reaffirms the U.N.'s commitment to Syria's sovereignty, and notes that the \"only sustainable solution to the current crisis\" is through an \"inclusive and Syria-led political process.\" The U.N. also reiterated its calls for humanitarian aid to have \"rapid, safe, and unhindered access throughout Syria.\" Earlier this week, a cease-fire in Syria was brokered by Russia and Turkey . As NPR reported at the time: \"Pointedly lacking a role in the announcement was the United States, which has provided arms and other support to rebel groups opposed to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. has not been present at recent meetings of Russian, Turkish and Syrian officials discussing a way to bring the conflict to an end.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

John Sellinger, 34, of Tampa, went into \"distress\" after being detained Wednesday by deputies who sprayed him with pepper spray and shocked him with a stun gun twice, according to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office. Sellinger died Thursday at a hospital. Autopsy results are pending. The Tampa Bay Times reported ( http://bit.ly/2iASeek ) that Sellinger was reported missing by his wife Wednesday. The sheriff's office said Sellinger then was the subject of multiple 911 calls about a reckless driver and attempts to steal a car and a motorcycle. Sellinger tried to steal the motorcycle from a 70-year-old man and was trying to choke him before bystanders intervened, authorities said. Sheriff's officials said that when deputies caught up to Sellinger, he refused to follow their commands and tried to fight them. Officials said Sellinger continued to struggle with deputies after being sprayed with pepper spray and shocked twice with the stun gun. According to the sheriff's office, Sellinger went into \"distress\" before medical assistance could arrive at the scene. Deputies attempted to revive him before paramedics took him to a hospital. The Tampa Bay Times reported that Sellinger's wife and mother declined to comment Friday. Sellinger's wife, Laura, also an Air Force veteran, posted a message Thursday to the social networking website LinkedIn that her husband had not been suicidal. Sellinger's neighbors said he had been a doting husband who was often seen pushing his 18-month-old son in a baby stroller or walking a dog. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Information from: Tampa Bay Times (St. Petersburg, Fla.), http://www.tampabay.com. 0 Shares ",

Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner 's budget office estimates the state's backlog of unpaid bills will hit a record $13.5 billion by July if the governor and Democrats who control the General Assembly remain deadlocked over a complete spending plan, a bleak reminder of what's at stake as negotiations... (Monique Garcia) Matt Bierman, interim vice president for administrative services, told state officials that with January tuition payments, the school will have enough money to meet financial obligations \"for a couple months.\" But if no assistance comes from the state, the school may have to tap into restricted funds earmarked to pay back loans used to finance construction projects. Bierman told the Tribune that Western has \"adequate cash to get through the spring semester,\" but said the school will have to make some tough decisions if state funds don't come sooner rather than later. \"We continue to believe that higher education plays a role in the future growth of the state of Illinois, and at Western we are doing everything we can to make sure we are providing a high-quality education,\" Bierman said. \"We aren't going anywhere.\" Further adding to university cash-flow problems is the lack of funding for scholarships for low-income students known as the Monetary Award Program. Most schools fronted that money last school year so students could enroll. The stopgap provided $151 million to pay back those costs but did not provide any scholarship money for the current school year \u2014 again leaving schools to decide if they can take on the extra burden or require students to make up the difference. \"It's Groundhog Day over and over again,\" said Dunn, the SIU president. \"We're basically back at zero, or even a little less than zero, and we are replaying this drama once again, putting together a number of scenarios depending on what may happen in the spring \u2026 only we're at that point of crisis even earlier than last year.\" Social services Among those hardest hit by the budget stalemate is the state's network of human service providers, the hundreds of business and nonprofits throughout Illinois that provide a variety of services for the state's most vulnerable. That includes breast and cervical cancer screenings for poor women, treatment for drug addiction, counseling for victims of sexual assault, home-delivered meals for seniors and shelters for the homeless. Many providers have long complained they are underfunded by the state, a situation exacerbated as they went nearly a year without payments before the stopgap budget was enacted. That money helped slow a wave of closures and program cuts but did not stop them. The stopgap authorized roughly $670 million for health and human services, about 65 percent of what providers normally would get. But as was the case with universities, that money had to last for 18 months instead of 12. It wasn't enough to keep a program running at the YWCA Northwestern Illinois that worked with teens who are pregnant or new parents. The program worked primarily with Latino youth, and not only taught young parents how to raise healthy children but also aimed to prevent teens from getting pregnant again. \"We had waited almost an entire year to get paid and I just could not afford to foot the bill for the state of Illinois anymore,\" said Kris Kieper Machajewski, CEO of the Rockford-based organization.

Metropolitan Family Services was forced to shut down part of its CILA program, which provides apartments for people with severe mental illnesses, due to the Illinois\u00a0budget stalemate.\u00a0 Resident Tokiko Basso, 71, sits on her bed Dec. 29, 2016, at her Community Integrated Living Arrangement apartment in Justice. Her roommate, Patricia Pusateri, 57, stands near the door. Metropolitan Family Services was forced to shut down part of its CILA program, which provides apartments for people with severe mental illnesses, due to the Illinois\u00a0budget stalemate.\u00a0 (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) \"It's just unfathomable to me that we have lived this long without a state budget, and I don't believe that they truly understand what this is doing,\" Kieper Machajewski said. \"The people we are working with, most of them hold full-time jobs, they are working toward economic independence, and we are jeopardizing that.\" In Chicago, Metropolitan Family Services shut down half of its community-integrated living arrangement program, which provided apartments for people with severe mental illnesses. The program was designed to help clients learn to live on their own, under round-the-clock supervision from staff. The group found alternative housing for the eight people who lost their apartments, but not without difficulty. Most other providers were booked or also faced cuts due to the budget impasse, and it remains unclear if the state will provide enough money to keep the remainder of the program running. \"Our clients are very vulnerable, and through no fault of their own they have ended up in a very difficult situation,\" said Jean Xoubi, program director of adult mental health at Metropolitan. \"Mental illness is no different than a physical illness and we wouldn't dream of not taking care of somebody with a heart issue or cancer \u2026 they feel like nobody cares about them.\" The organization also is struggling to keep afloat a program that provides legal help to domestic violence victims after roughly $18 million normally earmarked for victim care was not included in the stopgap budget. Of that, Metropolitan usually gets $600,000 but received just $54,000 this year, said Karina Ayala-Bermejo, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Metropolitan Family Services. \"That may seem insignificant, but it's hugely significant for the work that we do,\" Ayala-Bermejo said. \"We are in a bit of a dire situation. This year we have made huge cuts and painful decisions prior to this, and now we're talking about stripping down even further.\" What's next With no budget agreement in sight, a group of social service providers is hoping for some assistance from the courts. The Pay Now Illinois coalition sued in May, but a Cook County judge tossed the case, saying it was a matter for higher courts to decide. The suit is at an appellate court, with the group hoping the Illinois Supreme Court eventually weighs in. But that takes time and isn't a guarantee, so until then providers are bracing for even more pain. As it is, what little money they did get has been slow to arrive. The state's bill backlog is about $11 billion, meaning payments are months behind schedule. \"For people like me who are policy-driven, we look at data and polices and the best way to solve problems. If we do this now and we spend money now, we get these better outcomes,\" said Durbin, the Pay Now chair who also is CEO of the Illinois Collaboration on Youth. \"But it's impossible to comprehend what's happening in those terms because there is no policy justification for what we are doing, because what we are doing in pretty much every way is making things worse.\" ",

This burned vehicle, matching the description of the car rented by Greece's ambassador to Brazil Kyriakos Amiridis, was found with a body inside it in Nova Iguacu, but forensics experts have not yet identified the dead person. Amiridis went missing on Monday in the city of Nova Iguacu. (AP Photo/Leo Correa) 0 Shares Email Police in Brazil believe that Greece's ambassador to the country was killed by his wife's lover under her orders in a house in the Rio area and have detained three suspects, authorities said Friday. Ambassador Kyriakos Amiridis went missing on Monday in Nova Iguacu, a city just north of Rio de Janeiro, where the ambassador had been vacationing. The couple lived most of the time in the capital of Brasilia. On Friday, police investigator Evaristo Pontes Magalhaes said that 29-year-old police officer Sergio Gomes Moreira Filho had confessed to killing Amiridis, alleging self-defense. He said the policeman was having an affair with the ambassador's 40-year-old wife, Francoise. Filho's cousin, Eduardo de Melo, acknowledged taking part in the killing as a lookout, Magalhaes said. The cousin accused Francoise of offering him the equivalent of $25,000 to participate. A judge ordered the detention of Francoise, her lover and his cousin, and the three were in custody. Francoise has denied any role in the alleged plot. According to Magalhaes, Francoise said she couldn't stop Filho from killing her husband and insisted she was not at home at the time of the crime. But the police investigator said in a press conference late Friday that the \"evidence clearly puts the ambassador's wife as a co-author of the crime.\" He said she started plotting with her lover to kill the ambassador after the couple had a serious fight three days before Christmas . \"All our evidence suggests that her motivation was to use the financial resources left by the ambassador so she could enjoy life with Sergio,\" the police officer, Magalhaes said. The first signs the ambassador had been murdered emerged late Thursday, when police found blood spots believed to be his on a sofa inside the house the couple kept in Nova Iguacu, where the wife's family lives. Filho told police that he strangled the ambassador during a fight, but the blood evidence found on the scene makes his claim unlikely, Magalhaes said. Neighbors said they did not hear any shots, leading police to believe the policeman stabbed Amiridis. The investigation showed that Amiridis' body was removed from the house in a carpet at the same time that Francoise arrived with their 10 year-old daughter, who did not see the body of her dead father, Magalhaes said. Police believe a body found in a burned-out car that Amiridis had rented on Dec. 21 belongs to the ambassador, but forensics experts are still working to confirm that it is him. Brazil's government has offered its condolences to Greece over his death. The Greek Embassy website in Brazil says Amiridis started his career as diplomat in 1985 in Athens and became Greece's top diplomat in Brazil in 2016. He earlier was Greece's ambassador to Libya and worked as consul in Rio from 2001-2004. 0 Shares ",
