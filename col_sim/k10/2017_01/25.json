So I am begging the president, share with us the information you have about this or please stop saying it.\" Senate Armed Services Committee member Sen. Lindsey Graham speaks on Capitol Hill on Jan. 5, 2017. Evan Vucci / AP, file Graham, who along with Senator John McCain, R-Ariz., has been one of Trump's more outspoken Republican critics, said the new president needs to put this issue to rest \u2014 for his own good. Related: Trump Again Makes Debunked Claim: 'Illegals' Cost Me Popular Vote \"As a matter of fact I'd like you to do more than stop saying it,\" he said. \"I'd like you to come forward and say having looked at it I am confident the election was fair and accurate and people who voted voted legally. Cause if he doesn't do that, this is going to undermine his ability to govern this country.\" There are no signs that Trump intends to do that. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday afternoon that Trump has \"believed for a long, long time\" that illegal immigrants voted in the presidential election, but declined to share evidence that supports Trump's belief. When asked if Trump was planning to launch an investigation, Spicer said, \"We're here on day two. Let's not prejudge what we may or may not do in the future.\" Trump reached the White House by winning the Electoral College , but he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by a whopping 2.9 million votes, according to the certified final election results from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Graham spoke out a day after Trump reportedly spent the first 10 minutes of his bipartisan meeting with congressional leaders at the White House claiming once again that 3 to 5 million people who shouldn't have been allowed to vote cast their ballots for Clinton. It's a false claim that Trump began making back in November when it became clear that he was losing the popular vote to Clinton . \"By repeating false and unsubstantiated voter fraud allegations as the cause for losing the popular vote, President Trump is dangerously attacking the legitimacy of free and fair elections and the foundation of our democracy,\" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said. There are not \"alternative facts,\" he added. \"They are corrosive lies without any evidence,\" Padilla said. \"Even leaders in the President's own party agree there is no evidence to support his claims since they were irresponsibly made back in November.\" But in an interview Tuesday with NBC's Hallie Jackson, Trump supporter Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, insisted \"there is data out there\" to back up the president's claim \u2014 but said he believes the figure was closer to 2.4 million. King said he came up with the figure by doing \"an extrapolation calculation on how many illegals could have or could be voting in the United States.\" \"So it's plausible the number, three million sounds like it's a plausible number to me,\" he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) would not answer whether he agreed with Trump, but said \"the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true.\" \"It does occur,\" he told NBC's Kasie Hunt. \"There are always arguments on both sides about how much, how frequent, and all the rest.\" Still, said McConnell, \"most states have done a better job on this front.\" So far, just Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach \u2014 a Republican and political ally \u2014 has said Trump might have a case. And he has repeatedly cited a 2014 analysis by professors at Old Dominion University that was widely criticized by other scholars. Among those panning the Old Dominion analysis was the Cooperative Congressional Election Study at Harvard University, which supplied some of the data. The National Association of Secretaries of State, which includes many Republicans, also took issue with Trump's claim. \"We are not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by President Trump, but we are open to learning more about the Administration's concerns,\" the group said in a statement. \"In the lead up to the November 2016 election, secretaries of state expressed their confidence in the systemic integrity of our election process as a bipartisan group, and they stand behind that statement today.\" Frank Thorp V ",

The helicopter was carrying an injured person from the Campo Felice ski resort and \"came down from a height of around 600 metres,\" the agency added.

They're looking at phone calls to emergency dispatchers in particular, as Christopher Livesay in Rome tells our Newscast unit. The dispatchers \"appear to have ignored early cries for help.\" ",

Stephen Yang / Reuters, file President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders Tuesday to advance the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines.

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its allies have vigorously protested the Dakota Access project, saying it would damage cultural sites. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II told NBC News that the tribe would take immediate legal action to fight the executive order. \"The Trump administration's politically motivated decision violates the law and the Tribe will take legal action to fight it,\" said Archambault. \"We are not opposed to energy independence. We are opposed to reckless and politically motivated development projects, like DAPL, that ignore our treaty rights and risk our water. Creating a second Flint does not make America great again.\" In a statement, Greenpeace executive director Annie Leonard pledged that the same group of environmentalists, Native American activists and farmers that successfully stalled the projects in the past will continue to fight their advancement. Protesters march against the Dakota Access Pipeline in Pasadena, California on Jan. 2, after the Rose Parade. Protesters calling for Wells Fargo bank to divest from the pipeline mixed in with parade spectators leaving the venue after the parade. Robyn Beck / AFP - Getty Images, file \"Keystone, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and fossil fuel infrastructure projects like them will only make billionaires richer and make the rest of us suffer,\" she said. \"We will resist this with all of our power and we will continue to build the future the world wants to see.\" Backers of the pipelines say they will create jobs and cut energy costs. During a meeting with auto executives earlier Tuesday, Trump described himself as \"an environmentalist\" but argued that federal regulatory and permitting processes are too drawn out. \"I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist,\" he said. \"I believe in it, but it's out of control and we're going to make a very short process and we're going to either give you your permits or we're not going to give you your permits, but you're going to know very quickly.\" The Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline in November 2015, and it denied a permit for the Dakota Access project late last year.

A Saturday Night Live writer's tweet that mocked the 10-year-old has resulted in her indefinite suspension. Getty Images After her tweet about President Trump's youngest son sparked anger and resulted in her suspension, Saturday Night Live writer Katie Rich has apologized. Rich says she regrets the tweet that she now calls \"inexcusable.\" Rich, who's one of around 30 writers listed in Saturday Night Live's credits, issued her apology Monday about the tweet that was evidently meant to be humorous but was widely criticized for attacking a 10-year-old. A person familiar with the situation tells NPR that the suspension was levied shortly after Rich's tweet during Friday's presidential inauguration, and that the suspension is indefinite. Rich deleted the tweet a few hours after it was published. I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions & offensive words. It was inexcusable & I'm so sorry. \u2014 Katie Rich (@katiemaryrich) January 23, 2017 \"I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet,\" Rich wrote Monday. \"I deeply regret my actions & offensive words. It was inexcusable & I'm so sorry.\" The tweet prompted an online campaign calling for Rich to be fired. On Monday, media news site Deadline was the first to report that Rich had been suspended from her job writing for the \"Weekend Update\" news segment on Saturday Night Live, the NBC show that's often traded barbs with President Trump. Article continues after sponsorship By trying to make a joke about Trump's son, Rich broke a longstanding convention that places the children of politicians \u2014 and especially those of presidents \u2014 off-limits to ridicule or attacks. In the era of social media, that convention has been tested more frequently in recent years. In 2014, Republican congressional staffer Elizabeth Lauten resigned after she posted comments on Facebook that sharply criticized Malia and Sasha Obama for their appearance as their father conferred the traditional presidential pardon upon a turkey at Thanksgiving. After Trump took the oath of office on Friday, those who came to Barron Trump's defense over the weekend included Chelsea Clinton, who wrote, \"Barron Trump deserves the chance every child does \u2014 to be a kid.\" Barron Trump deserves the chance every child does-to be a kid. Standing up for every kid also means opposing @POTUS policies that hurt kids. ",

    "text": "Senate Confirms Trump's Nominee for US Ambassador to the UN By richard lardner, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 24, 2017, 6:25 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Jan. 18, 2017 file photo, UN Ambassador-designate, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has overwhelmingly approved Haley's nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) 0 Shares Email The Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations by a decisive margin Tuesday as Republican-led committees paved the way for three more of his Cabinet nominees to be approved just days into the new administration. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley won strong support for the U.N. post despite her lack of foreign policy experience. Senators voted 96-4 on Haley's nomination. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Haley is a proven leader who will be a \"fierce advocate\" at the U.N. for American interests. But not everyone was sold. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said Haley didn't convince him that she'll serve effectively. The U.S. ambassador to the international body should be an expert on international affairs, Coons said, \"not someone who will be learning on the job.\" A Senate vote is expected soon on Trump's choice for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson . The Foreign Relations Committee narrowly approved his nomination Monday, 11-10. No Democrats on the panel voted for Tillerson. Tillerson's bid got a key boost when Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced his support Tuesday. Manchin, who faces re-election in 2018 in a state that backed Trump heavily in the presidential election , said Tillerson's extensive business career \"will bring a unique perspective to the State Department.\" The vote on Haley capped a day when the GOP-led panels endorsed Trump's choices to lead the Transportation, Housing, and Commerce departments. Yet congressional Republicans criticized Democrats for not moving quickly enough on all of the president's selections. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, forced a one-week delay \u2014 until Jan. 31 \u2014 of the committee's vote on Trump's attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Feinstein said senators \"owe it\" to the more than 1 million women who marched in Washington and other locations on Saturday to be careful in considering Sessions' nomination and his willingness to protect equal rights. She also said the committee received 188 pages of new material that needs to be reviewed. Committee rules allow any member of the panel to delay a vote. Deliberations over two of Trump's picks turned testy as both nominees faced questions from Democrats over their personal finances. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the president's choice for health secretary, defended his decision to invest in health care companies as he testified before the Senate Finance Committee. Panel staffers found Price undervalued around 400,000 shares of stock in Australian drug company Innate Immunotherapeutics that he purchased last August. He reported the shares were valued at $50,000 to $100,000, but those shares were worth up to $250,000. Price blamed a \"clerical error\" and answered \"no\" when Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked if he'd used poor judgment. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Trump's nominee for budget director, South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, should be disqualified because he failed to pay more than $15,000 in payroll taxes for a babysitter more than a decade ago. Mulvaney said he discovered the unpaid taxes while preparing for the nominating process. He has since paid the taxes. Trump's choice for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is also being scrutinized by Democrats about her qualifications, political donations and longtime work advocating for charter schools and school choice in her home state of Michigan. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., delivered a withering critique of DeVos on Tuesday, saying he has no confidence she will fully support traditional public schools and students. The Senate Commerce Committee approved by voice votes Trump's choices of conservative billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to run the Commerce Department and Elaine Chao to lead the Transportation Department. Ross has specialized in buying distressed companies that still have a potential for delivering profits. He has known Trump for more than 20 years, was an early supporter of his presidential campaign and served as an economic policy adviser to Trump's team. Chao, an experienced Washington hand, was labor secretary in President George W. Bush's administration and deputy transportation secretary under President George H.W. Bush. She is also the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Chao is expected to play a major role in Trump's effort to fulfill his campaign promise to generate $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. Ben Carson, nominated to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, won unanimous approval from the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. The former Republican presidential candidate and celebrated neurosurgeon would lead a sprawling agency with 8,300 employees and a budget of about $47 billion. Sen. Michael Crapo of Idaho, the committee's Republican chairman, praised Carson and said the department \"will benefit from having a secretary with a different perspective and a diverse background.\" Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the panel's top Democrat, said he had reservations but welcomed Carson's promises to address lead hazards in public housing. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Joan Lowy, Stephen Ohlemacher, Alan Fram, Jennifer Kerr and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner 0 Shares ",

    "text": "A local newspaper account of the ceremony carried on the same page an advertisement for the sale of \"two likely Negro Boys and a Girl.\" Thus began the entwined histories of slavery in America and the institution that would become Columbia University. Now, some of the details of that history are publicly available. Columbia is the latest major university to publish a preliminary report and put up a website with details about its historical ties to slavery. \"From the outset, slavery was intertwined with the life of the college,\" the preliminary report by Columbia professor Eric Foner states. \"Of the ten men who served as presidents of King's and Columbia between 1754 and the end of the Civil War, at least half owned slaves at one point in their lives. So did the first four treasurers.\" Most of the original donors to the institution \"had a connection to slavery either via ownership or trade.\" At least five other elite educational institutions have released reports of their own on the topic. Brown University , Georgetown University , Harvard University , University of Virginia and Yale University all have websites with information about how the institutions historically benefited from slavery in America. Article continues after sponsorship \"The academy never stood apart from American slavery,\" Craig Steven Wilder wrote in a 2013 book on the topic. \"In fact, it stood beside church and state as the third pillar of a civilization built on bondage.\" Columbia's website, columbiaandslavery.columbia.edu , includes information about historical figures, including people who were enslaved and lived at the university in its early days. One such man , referred to in historical documents as Joe, was owned by George Washington's stepson John Parke Custis. Joe was a personal servant for the young man throughout his school years, as the report explains: \"Joe frequently traveled between Custis's school in Caroline County, Virginia, and Washington's estate at Mount Vernon, a distance of about seventy-five miles, toting books, letters, medicines, and other items. In effect, Joe often served as a private messenger between Custis and his guardian. ... \"Joe accompanied Custis to King's [College], where he lived in Custis's suite of rooms in the college. Joe prepared breakfast each morning, while in the evening, Custis dined with the faculty. In a letter to his mother, Martha Washington, Custis described his living situation at King's: 'I have a large parlour with two Studyes or closets, each large enough to contain a bed, trunk and couple of chairs, one I sleep in, & the other Joe calls his, my chamber and parlour are paper'd with a cheap tho very pretty Paper, the other is painted... I generally get up about Six or a little after, dress myself & go to chappel, by the time that Prayers are over Joe has me a little Breakfast to which I sit down very contented... .' \" Custis left college after four months, and the report says that \"a letter from Custis to Washington in 1774 indicates that Joe accompanied him and continued to serve as a family messenger. After 1774, however, Joe disappears from the historical record, so it remains unknown if he ever gained his freedom.\" The research for the project was led by Foner, a professional historian, but much of the archival information comes from the research of current students at the university who wrote research papers as part of a class offered each year by the history department and titled, \"Columbia University and Slavery.\" One research project by a student named Jordan Brewington found \"28 King's College and Columbia students and affiliates submitted 43 advertisements advertising fugitives or selling enslaved human beings.\" Georgetown Will Offer An Edge In Admissions To Descendants Of Slaves Another project by student Elana Sulakshana documented racist scientific beliefs that were taught to medical students at the university throughout the 19th century. One of the challenges for archival researchers is that Columbia's campus has moved twice in the 250 years since it was founded and that many records were lost in each move. In particular, the report notes, student and faculty found it was difficult to find \"records of the experiences of individual enslaved people who were owned by affiliates of King's and Columbia College.\" ",

Elizabeth Keatinge (@ekeatinge) has more. Time White House press secretary Sean Spicer calls on a reporter during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Tuesday. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) WASHINGTON \u2013 A Trump Administration directive ordering employees at the Environmental Protection Agency to halt external communications and posts on social media\u00a0fueled news reports Tuesday that a number of other agencies were issuing similar gag orders to their workers. But while the EPA confirmed it was freezing such activity as well as new contracts and grants, administration officials spent much of Tuesday tamping down conspiratorial rumors of wide-spread media blackouts. White House Spokesman Sean Spicer said he was aware of the news reports but not familiar with any broad edict. \u201cWe\u2019re looking into it,\u201d he told reporters during the daily White House briefing Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that when there\u2019s an administration turnover that we\u2019re going to review the policies.\u201d Horse soring restrictions among those halted by Trump ban on new rules The agencies reportedly affected in some measure included Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But spokespeople for those agencies called the reports\u00a0overblown or flatly refuted them. \u201cContrary to erroneous media reports, HHS and its agencies continue to communicate fully about its work through all of its regular communication channels with the public, the media and other relevant audiences,\u201d according to a statement from the agency. \u201cThere is no directive to do otherwise.\u201d That was in response to a Huffington Post story that officials at some smaller agencies within HHS had been told not to send \u201cany correspondence to public officials\u201d according to memos obtained by the online news site. And BuzzFeed reported that some Agriculture employees have been told not to publicly share summaries of scientific papers or tweeting through its official site. A spokeswoman for the USDA had yet to return a call for comment Tuesday afternoon. But according to a Reuters report,\u00a0the agency said an internal email sent to workers calling for a suspension of \u201cpublic-facing documents\u201d at its Agricultural Research Service was flawed and\u00a0new guidance would be issued to replace it. Only the EPA did not dispute the reports. But a statement from the agency said it \u201cfully intends to continue to provide information to the public. A fresh look at public affairs and communications processes is common practice for any new Administration, and a short pause in activities allows for this assessment.\u201d Political opponents pounced on the administration. \u201cThis administration is launching direct attacks on truth and transparency in our gov\u2019t. Very troubling -- and honestly, anti-democratic,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., tweeted. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks during the Women's March on Washington, Saturday. \u00a0(Photo: Jose Luis Magana, AP) More alarming to state regulators is the temporary suspension of EPA grants and contracts. The abrupt move to suspend funding posed \u201csignificant concern\u201d for some states that are already having to cope with incremental aid from Washington since Congress has yet to pass a 2017 budget, said Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, executive director and general counsel of the Environmental Council of the States. ECOS is the association representing state environmental agencies. \u201cStates were immediately concerned that they would be having to make cuts in staff ... because the money flow is already sporadic,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u00a0received phone calls from all over the country from states of all political stripes.\u201d Environmental groups also registered their anger. \u201cPresident Trump's move to freeze all communications and EPA grant programs on the first day of his job should be a major red flag for all Americans at the start of a new administration,\u201d said Liz Perera, climate change policy director for the Sierra Club. \u201cThe EPA was created to ensure that all Americans can enjoy clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and have their health protected from environmental and climate threats. Trump's action puts American lives and communities at risk.\u201d Myron Ebell, headed the EPA transition team for the Trump administration, told ProPublica Monday the move was not unprecedented. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don\u2019t want to have happen, so any regulations going forward, contracts, grants, hires, they want to make sure to look at them first,\u201d Ebell said. \u201cThis may be a little wider than some previous administrations, but it\u2019s very similar to what others have done.\u201d Trump\u2019s choice to run the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. Reports of the EPA directive came days after the Interior Department temporarily shut down its Twitter site after a National Park Service employee retweeted side-by-side photos of the crowds that gathered in 2009 on the National Mall for President Barack Obama\u2019s first inaugural and the apparently much smaller crowd that\u00a0came to witness Trump\u2019s swearing-in Friday.

    "text": "Jan 24 2017, 6:31 pm ET South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley Confirmed as UN Ambassador by Alexandra Jaffe advertisement South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley easily won confirmation to be President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations Tuesday. The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of confirmation, with just four senators \u2014 Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democrats Chris Coons of Delaware and Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico \u2014 voting against her. It was a quick confirmation, and a striking reversal in fortune for a woman who loudly criticized Trump during the GOP primary and endorsed one of his rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The two-term governor faced questions from Democrats over her lack of experience with global affairs but won plaudits from senators for her handling of prickly issues like Russia and UN actions toward Israel during her confirmation hearings. She's the first woman to be confirmed to Trump's cabinet, but likely not the last; on Tuesday Elaine Chao's nomination as Transportation Secretary was passed out of committee, as well. Unlike Trump's secretary of state pick, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Haley broke with Trump and repeatedly criticized Russia during her confirmation hearing. \"Russia is trying to show their muscle right now. It's what they do,\" she said. She added: \"I don't think we can trust them.

And Haley said during her hearing she would speak up to Trump in favor of the NATO military alliance and the UN, both of which Trump has criticized and toyed with the idea of abandoning. \"Those are his opinions as they stand now,\" she said. \"I look forward to communicating to him \u2026 the importance of alliances [and] that the U.N. matters. But on Israel, she was fully in line with Trump, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that she \"absolutely\" supports his promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a controversial move as both Israelis and Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their territory.

    "text": "Dwyane Wade says Bulls' play will factor into his player option decision Photos of Dwyane Wade, who signed with the Bulls after a 13-year run with the Heat. K.C. Johnson Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Dwyane Wade 's current focus isn't on the decision he faces this summer, when he  can exercise a $23.8 million player option  for  2017-18. It's about trying to get an up-and-down Bulls team to play with more consistency,  via his on-court play and off-court leadership. But when Wade makes that call,  how the Bulls fare over the remainder of the season will  be a big factor in a decision loaded with, in his words, many variables. \"I wouldn't lie to you and say no. Of course,\" Wade said, when asked if continued mediocrity  would influence his decision. \"I can't play this game forever. I just turned 35 and I have a number in my head on how long I want to play. \"It's tough in this league as well because a lot of it also depends on how much money you're willing to make. It depends on what city you're willing to be in. So it's a lot of variables to that. But no question about it, what happens throughout this year as I go into my summer, I'll definitely take a look at it. I take my career seriously and where I am and where I want to be. And I will do the same thing this summer.\" Earlier this season, Wade said he isn't \"ring chasing\" at this stage of his career. He elaborated Tuesday. \"The reason I said that,\" he said, \"was they asked me a question about going to the Cavs this summer, and I said: 'Well, I think they had, like, $2.4 million (in a salary-cap exception). It ain't that bad for me now. I do have three rings.' \"I mean, I wasn't willing to do that now, not at all, not at this point. When you're a veteran guy, some guys have taken those sacrifices. David West last year, he gave all of his money back to San Antonio. That's something he wanted to do. He wanted to put himself in position to win a ring (with the Warriors). \"I have three. I've been in five Finals. So I don't need to do that. But it is a time where you want to be on a team that can compete too. So it's  a fine line between what you really want. This summer, that's not what I wanted.\" What Wade wants is to see the Bulls  be more consistent. \"I'm in a position as a player to try to be my best self,\" Wade said. \"The thing with this team \u2014 and I've been saying it all year \u2014 is you have to learn how hard it is to win. Some nights, we take the approach where we'll do anything to try to get a win. And some nights, we just go through the motions. ",

And the singer\u2019s 18-year-old daughter, Paris, says the grief of her father\u2019s death has followed her since Time Paris Jackson tells 'Rolling Stone' that she's now happier than she's ever been. (Photo: Gregg DeGuire, FilmMagic) Eight years after the death of her father, Paris Jackson, now 18, \u00a0finally appears to be comfortable in her own skin. But she had to withstand years of self-harming, cyber-bullying, a sexual assault, suicide attempts and getting sober to reach this point, she says. In what Rolling Stone \u00a0billed as her first in-depth interview, Michael Jackson's daughter revealed that she was assaulted by a stranger whom she described as \"much older\" and tried to kill herself multiple times. After the last attempt in 2013, she was sent to a therapeutic school in Utah, where she spent her sophomore year of high school and half of her junior year. She credits the experience with helping her to right the ship. \"It was great for me.\" Now, she says, \"I'm a completely different person.\" But up to that point, I was actually crazy, I was going through a lot of, like, teen angst. And I was also dealing with my depression and my anxiety without any help.\" Surprisingly, Jackson says modeling is therapeutic for her. \"I've had self-esteem issues for a really, really long time,\" she admitted,\u00a0\"Plenty of people think I'm ugly, and plenty of people don't. But there's a moment when I'm modeling where I forget about my self-esteem issues and focus on what the photographer's telling me \u2013 and I feel pretty.\" She added that after six years of being trolled online about her looks, she began to understand her father's plastic-surgery pursuits. \"The whole freedom-of-speech thing is great,\" she told writer\u00a0Brian Hiatt. \"But I don't think that our Founding Fathers predicted social media when they created all of these amendments and stuff.\" Here are five more interesting facts gleaned from Jackson's cover interview. 1. She lives in the studio where Michael Jackson first recorded Beat It After turning 18, she moved out of the house where she lived with grandmother and guardian, Katherine, and took up residence in a studio within the Jackson family compound in the Los Angeles enclave of Encino. Boyfriend\u00a0Michael Snoddy keeps his drums in the room where Jackson once rehearsed his dance moves. 2. She is certain Jackson was her biological father and considers herself black \"He is my father,\" she asserted. \"He will always be my father. He never wasn't, and he never will not be. People that knew him really well say they see him in me, that it's almost scary.\" In addition, she recalled that Jackson would \"point his finger at me and he'd be like, 'You're black. Be proud of your roots.' And I'd be like, 'OK, he's my dad, why would he lie to me?'\" ",

    "text": "Federal Debt Projected to Grow by Nearly $10 Trillion Over Next Decade By ALAN RAPPEPORT Continue reading the main story Photo Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, President Trump\u2019s choice to be White House budget director, during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 After seven years of fitful declines, the federal budget deficit is projected to swell again, adding nearly $10 trillion to the federal debt over the next 10 years, according to projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that reveal the strain that government debt could have on the economy as President Trump presses to slash taxes and ramp up spending. The deficit figures released Tuesday will be a major challenge to House Republicans, who were swept to power in 2010 on fears of a bloated deficit and who made controlling red ink a major part of their agenda under former President Barack Obama. Statutory caps imposed in 2011 on domestic and military spending have helped temper the deficit. But those controls are likely to be swamped by health care and Social Security spending that will rise with an aging population. Now, congressional leaders will have to choose between their fealty to the cause of fiscal prudence and the demands of the new president, who wants $1 trillion in infrastructure work over 10 years, a surge in military spending and large tax cuts for individuals and corporations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At a confirmation hearing on Tuesday, senators from both parties peppered Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to be the White House budget director, with questions about how Mr. Trump intended to keep his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare while addressing the budget shortfall. Continue reading the main story Mr. Mulvaney said that it would be his role to deliver hard truths to Mr. Trump. One of those truths, he suggested, could be the need to raise the eligibility age for Social Security, a proposal that is sure to be contentious.

Privacy Policy \u201cI haven\u2019t been quiet and shy since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cI have to imagine the president knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill this role. I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s why he hired me.\u201d He added, \u201cI believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later.\u201d The deficit is expected to shrink this fiscal year and next before increasing in 2019 and beyond. Deficits would cumulatively total $9.4 trillion from 2018 to 2027, the budget office projects. By 2023, the deficit would reach $1 trillion, and in 2027, a projected $1.4 trillion deficit would be equal to 5 percent of the economy. Most economists believe that deficits are helpful when economies are in recession, but some say that when they are near full employment, as the United States economy is now, deficits should be kept below 3 percent of the economy to avoid a drag on investment \u2014 or worse, a financial crisis. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s budget and economic outlook said that the share of debt held by the public was expected to reach 89 percent of gross domestic product in 2027. That level could increase the risk of a financial crisis and raise the possibility that investors will become skittish about financing the government\u2019s borrowing, some economists say, although many countries have far higher debt levels. After the release of the report, the Republican Study Committee , the main organization for House conservatives, signaled that it would not ignore that rising red ink to accommodate Mr. Trump\u2019s spending ambitions. Advertisement \u201cWithout changes to the federal budget, we are on a path to fiscal crisis with spending, deficits and debt continuing to balloon out of control,\u201d said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the group. Photo Projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reveal the strain that the government\u2019s debt will have on the economy as President Trump embarks on plans to slash taxes and ramp up spending. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Besides the deficit, tepid economic growth is also a concern. Over the next 10 years, real economic output is projected to grow at an annual rate of 1.9 percent. Mr. Trump has promised that his combination of tax cuts and investment in infrastructure will push growth above 4 percent, and Mr. Mulvaney argued on Tuesday that spurring growth was the most effective way of reducing the debt without imposing painful cuts to social safety-net programs. Some senators such as Angus King, independent of Maine, warned against a return to much-debated theories that tax cuts would generate enough growth to pay for themselves and reduce the deficit. Democrats are likely to oppose large tax cuts, but they will press Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to spend big on infrastructure. Senate Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a $1 trillion plan to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads, bridges, rail, transit systems, airports, sewer systems and power grid. \u201cWe will not cut middle-class programs like education and health care to pay for it,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. When it was pointed out that he was proposing the kind of deficit spending that Republicans were sure to balk at, Mr. Schumer was dismissive. \u201cWe Democrats believe that this should be a measure to get the economy going,\u201d he said. Republicans are pressing their own spending priorities, urging passage of legislation that would lift statutory spending caps on national defense, imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, while leaving in place the caps on domestic spending. Deficits Over the Next Decade Budget deficits as a share of the G.D.P. are projected to grow to 5 percent by 2027. 2000 ",

Negga ensures that audiences register the love between Richard and Mildred Loving in a nuanced, grounded way that never feels cloying, and Stone makes the most of some lovely moments in La La Land. But in Elle \u2014 a challenging, uncompromising film \u2014 Isabell Huppert is icy and ferocious, and she earns our sympathy while remaining unlikable. That is, as they say in acting conservatories, a neat trick. Notable Snubs?: Just about everyone expected to see Amy Adams in here for her quiet but hugely emotional performance in Arrival. And personally, I'd have loved to see Annette Bening in here, because she does so much in 20th Century Women that's small and quiet, unshowy and true.

Haley won strong support despite her lack of foreign policy experience. USA TODAY NETWORK South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in November. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) 138 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate confirmed President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations by a decisive margin Tuesday as Republican-led committees paved the way for three more of his Cabinet nominees to be approved just days into the new administration. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley won strong support for the U.N. post despite her lack of foreign policy experience. Senators voted 96-4 on Haley\u2019s nomination. Trump hiring freeze includes the short-staffed VA Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Haley is a proven leader who will be a \u201cfierce advocate\u201d at the U.N. for American interests. But not everyone was sold. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said Haley didn\u2019t convince him that she\u2019ll serve effectively. The U.S. ambassador to the international body should be an expert on international affairs, Coons said, \u201cnot someone who will be learning on the job.\u201d A Senate vote is expected soon on Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson. The Foreign Relations Committee narrowly approved his nomination Monday, 11-10. No Democrats on the panel voted for Tillerson. Spicer: Trump believes voter fraud claim despite lack of evidence Tillerson\u2019s bid got a key boost when Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced his support Tuesday. Manchin, who faces re-election in 2018 in a state that backed Trump heavily in the presidential election, said Tillerson\u2019s extensive business career \u201cwill bring a unique perspective to the State Department.\u201d The vote on Haley capped a day when the GOP-led panels endorsed Trump\u2019s choices to lead the Transportation, Housing, and Commerce departments. Yet congressional Republicans criticized Democrats for not moving quickly enough on all of the president\u2019s selections. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, forced a one-week delay \u2014 until Jan. 31 \u2014 of the committee\u2019s vote on Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Feinstein said senators \u201cowe it\u201d to the more than 1 million women who marched in Washington and other locations on Saturday to be careful in considering Sessions\u2019 nomination and his willingness to protect equal rights. She also said the committee received 188 pages of new material that needs to be reviewed. Committee rules allow any member of the panel to delay a vote. Deliberations over two of Trump\u2019s picks turned testy as both nominees faced questions from Democrats over their personal finances. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the president\u2019s choice for health secretary, defended his decision to invest in health care companies as he testified before the Senate Finance Committee. Panel staffers found Price undervalued around 400,000 shares of stock in Australian drug company Innate Immunotherapeutics that he purchased last August. He reported the shares were valued at $50,000 to $100,000, but those shares were worth up to $250,000. Price blamed a \u201cclerical error\u201d and answered \u201cno\u201d when Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked if he\u2019d used poor judgment. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Trump\u2019s nominee for budget director, South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, should be disqualified because he failed to pay more than $15,000 in payroll taxes for a babysitter more than a decade ago. Mulvaney said he discovered the unpaid taxes while preparing for the nominating process. He has since paid the taxes. Trump\u2019s choice for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is also being scrutinized by Democrats about her qualifications, political donations and longtime work advocating for charter schools and school choice in her home state of Michigan. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., delivered a withering critique of DeVos on Tuesday, saying he has no confidence she will fully support traditional public schools and students. The Senate Commerce Committee approved by voice votes Trump\u2019s choices of conservative billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to run the Commerce Department and Elaine Chao to lead the Transportation Department. Ross has specialized in buying distressed companies that still have a potential for delivering profits. He has known Trump for more than 20 years, was an early supporter of his presidential campaign and served as an economic policy adviser to Trump\u2019s team. Chao, an experienced Washington hand, was labor secretary in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration and deputy transportation secretary under President George H.W. Bush. She is also the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Chao is expected to play a major role in Trump\u2019s effort to fulfill his campaign promise to generate $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. Ben Carson, nominated to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, won unanimous approval from the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. The former Republican presidential candidate and celebrated neurosurgeon would lead a sprawling agency with 8,300 employees and a budget of about $47 billion. Sen. Michael Crapo of Idaho, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, praised Carson and said the department \u201cwill benefit from having a secretary with a different perspective and a diverse background.\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said he had reservations but welcomed Carson\u2019s promises to address lead hazards in public housing.

    "text": "Privacy Policy The green light for Keystone came after Mr. Trudeau\u2019s approval of two pipeline projects linked to Alberta\u2019s oil sands in late November. Expanded pipeline capacity and its potential to expand the market for the oil sands, which overwhelmingly export to the United States, are welcome developments in Alberta and neighboring Saskatchewan, both oil-producing provinces. But there is considerable opposition to Keystone and oil sands pipelines in general in other parts of Canada and within many indigenous communities. In addition to the Keystone and Dakota directives, Mr. Trump signed three others intended to ease the way for businesses and promote American manufacturing. One instructed the Commerce Department to develop a plan to ensure that all future pipelines built in the United States be constructed out of American-made materials. Another was aimed at streamlining what he called \u201cthe incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process and reducing regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing.\u201d The last directive was intended to expedite environmental reviews for \u201chigh-priority infrastructure projects\u201d like highways and bridges. Mr. Trump\u2019s actions came on a day when he met with the leaders of the country\u2019s largest automakers, whom he has been pushing to produce more of their products in the United States. He singled out General Motors in a Twitter post this month for building the Chevy Cruze hatchback in Mexico. \u201cMake in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\u201d he wrote . Hosting the automakers on Tuesday, he made a point of holding out a chair for Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cYou\u2019re not being singled out, believe me, Mary, I promise,\u201d he told her as journalists recorded the moment. \u201cBut you have a lot of plants from a lot of different items built in the United States. And it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s happening big league.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump said he understood that manufacturers faced regulatory burdens in the United States and he would make it easier for them to make their products in the country. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make the process much more simple for the auto companies and for everybody else who wants to do business in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find this to be from being very inhospitable to extremely hospitable.\u201d Anticipating criticism from advocates of tackling climate change, he added: \u201cI am, to a large extent, an environmentalist, I believe in it. But it\u2019s out of control and we\u2019re going to make it a very short process. And we\u2019re going to either give you your permits or we\u2019re not going to give you your permits. But you\u2019re going to know very quickly. And generally speaking we\u2019re going to be giving you your permits.\u201d The auto executives offered praise for Mr. Trump after the session. \u201cWe\u2019re very encouraged by the president and the economic policies that he\u2019s forwarding,\u201d Mark Fields, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, told reporters outside the White House as they left. He cited the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cWe appreciate the president\u2019s courage to walk away from a bad trade deal,\u201d he said. Ian Austen contributed from Ottawa.

    "text": "<p>The wreckage of an helicopter lies in the snow after crashing in the Campo Felice ski area in Abruzzo, central Italy, &nbsp;Jan. 24, 2017.</p> Close AP FARINDOLA, Italy -- Hopes began to fade Tuesday that any more survivors would be found from a devastating avalanche , as the death toll climbed to 15 and rescue crews were hit with another tragedy nearby: the crash of a helicopter ferrying an injured skier off the slopes. Italy\u2019s civil protection agency spokesman Luigi D\u2019Angelo said the helicopter was taking the injured skier from the Campo Felice ski area to the Abruzzo regional capital of L\u2019Aquila. Television footage and photographs from the scene showed the helicopter was smashed to pieces in the snow, with only the tail propellers and rear section still intact. All six of those on board were killed in the crash. Rescue crews brought the bodies down in sleds to waiting snowcats. The area is in Abruzzo, the same mountainous region where emergency crews have been working around the clock to recover victims of the powerful Jan. 18 avalanche that crushed a hotel. More survivors of Italy avalanche rescued Abruzzo was slammed by a series of powerful earthquakes and yards of snowfall that triggered the Jan. 18 avalanche at the Hotel Rigopiano. The death toll from the avalanche climbed to 15 on Tuesday with the discovery of more bodies, leaving 14 people still unaccounted for. Firefighter spokesman Alberto Maiolo said search crews aided by excavators were finally able to penetrate the snow-covered central part of the hotel for the first time -- the bar and kitchen area -- and found the bodies. He said there were no signs of life. \u201cLogically, hopes fade as time passes, but we are continuing to search and trying to do it as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. The first funerals were held Tuesday, with crowds gathering under a steady rain outside the hilltop church in Farindola to pay their respects to Alessandro Giancaterino. Avalanche buries Italian hotel, dozens missing The chief waiter, one of the first victims pulled from the rubble, had offered to stay for a double shift on Jan. 18 to spare a colleague from having to make his way to the hotel through the snow, which was six to 10 feet deep in some places. \u201cHe was a great hard worker. He was very professional,\u201d said his brother, Massimiliano Giancaterino. \u201cThis is the memory that I want to keep of my brother, beyond obviously the private ones that I keep in my heart.\u201d Prosecutors are investigating whether a series of missed communications, underestimations of risks and delays in responding to days of heavy snowfall contributed to the toll from the avalanche. In addition, they are looking into the original construction of the isolated resort and whether it should have been open for business at all in such conditions. Giancaterino, who is also a former mayor of Farindola, said it was useless to speculate now, while an investigation was just beginning, about whether the tragedy could have been avoided. \u201cNow it is not the time for hypothesis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the time of pain and above all my thoughts go to the friends and relatives of those who are still missing,\u201d he said. Nine people have been pulled out alive from the rubble, three of whom remained hospitalized in nearby Pescara. Three puppies were also rescued from the heavily-damaged hotel on Monday. ",

    "text": "Trump admin orders EPA contract freeze and media blackout White House spokesman Sean Spicer on EPA media blackout White House spokesman Sean Spicer says \"we're looking into it\" in response to questions on the EPA media blackout. (Jan. 24, 2017) White House spokesman Sean Spicer says \"we're looking into it\" in response to questions on the EPA media blackout. (Jan. 24, 2017) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The Trump administration has instituted a media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency and barred staff from awarding any new contracts or grants, part of a broader communications clampdown within the executive branch. The prohibitions came to light Tuesday as the agency moved to delay implementation of at least 30 environmental rules finalized in the closing months of President Barack Obama's term, a potential first step to seeking to kill the regulations. A summary of the actions posted in the Federal Register includes a long list of regulations that include updated air pollution rulings for several states, renewable fuel standards and limits on the amount of formaldehyde that can leach from wood products. President Donald Trump signed a directive shortly after his inauguration on Friday ordering a \"regulatory freeze pending review\" for all federal agency rules that had been finalized that have not yet taken effect. Emails sent to EPA staff and reviewed by The Associated Press also detailed specific prohibitions banning press releases, blog updates or posts to the agency's social media accounts. The Trump administration has also ordered what it called a temporary suspension of all new business activities at the department, including issuing task orders or work assignments to EPA contractors. The orders were expected to have a significant and immediate impact on EPA activities nationwide. EPA contracts with outside vendors for a wide array of services, from engineering and research science to janitorial supplies. Similar orders barring external communications have been issued in recent days by the Trump administration at other federal agencies, including the departments of Transportation, Agriculture and Interior. Staffers in EPA's public affairs office are instructed to forward all inquiries from reporters to the Office of Administration and Resources Management. (Steven Mufson, Juliet Eilperin) \"Incoming media requests will be carefully screened,\" one directive said. \"Only send out critical messages, as messages can be shared broadly and end up in the press.\" A review of EPA websites and social media accounts, which typically include numerous new posts each day, showed no new activity since Friday. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday he had no specific information on the blackout. \"I don't think it's any surprise that when there's an administration turnover, that we're going to review the policies,\" Spicer said. Doug Ericksen, the communications director for Trump's transition team at EPA, said he expects the communications ban to be lifted by the end of this week. \"We're just trying to get a handle on everything and make sure what goes out reflects the priorities of the new administration,\" Ericksen said. Beyond what was stated in the internal email, Ericksen clarified that the freeze on EPA contracts and grants won't apply to pollution cleanup efforts or infrastructure construction activities. The agency later said it would also seek to complete that review by Friday. State agencies that rely on EPA for funding were left in the dark, with both Democratic and Republican officials saying they had received no information from EPA about the freeze. \"We are actively seeking additional information so we can understand the impact of this action on our ability to administer critical programs,\" said Alan Matheson, executive director of Utah Department of Environmental Quality. (Jennifer A. Dlouhy) Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the Trump administration should immediately reverse the media blackout and contracting freeze. \"This decision could have damaging implications? for communities across New York state and the country, from delaying testing for lead in schools to restricting efforts to keep drinking water clean to holding up much-needed funding to revitalize toxic brownfield sites,\" Schumer said. The executive director for the advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, Jeff Ruch, said the orders go beyond what has occurred in prior presidential transitions. \"We're watching the dark cloud of Mordor extend over federal service,\" Ruch said Tuesday, referring to the evil kingdom in the epic fantasy \"The Lord of the Rings.\" Ruch noted that key posts at EPA have not yet been filled with Republican appointees, including Trump's nominee for EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt. That means there are not yet the new senior personnel in place to make decisions. Environmentalists said the orders were having a chilling effect on EPA staff already suffering from low morale. Trump and Pruitt have both been frequent critics of the agency and have questioned the validity of climate science showing that the Earth is warming and man-made carbon emissions are to blame. Staff at the Agriculture Department's Agricultural Research Service also received orders not to issue any news releases, photos, fact sheets and social media posts. After an email of the order leaked to the media, the agency said it would rescind the memo. Spokespersons at agencies within the Transportation Department who are career employees received an email Monday morning telling them: \"There will be no releases or social media until we hear from new leadership.\" The one-sentence email, which was obtained by The Associated Press, came from the department's top career spokeswoman, rather than a political appointee. The department said in a statement that transportation officials didn't receive any guidance on press releases and social media from the White House. \"Everybody's being very cautious\" and erring on the side of not releasing information, one DOT employee said. The employee didn't have permission to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. ",

    "text": "JAN. 24, 2017 Photo President Trump leaving the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Va., on Saturday, his first full day in office. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 As tempting as it is for a new administration to cram as much as possible into its first 100 days, the period is almost always dominated by events the president did not anticipate. It is sobering, humbling and almost always marred by crisis. Sometimes it takes a tragic turn. All new administrations set grand plans: ambitious legislation introduced on Capitol Hill, trips across the country to promote the new policies, visits with foreign dignitaries. Then reality intervenes. Barack Obama had to deal with a Somali pirate attack while he was trying to resuscitate the collapsing economy. George W. Bush , fresh from the bruising recount battle, quickly had to resolve tense military disputes abroad. Bill Clinton \u2019s early days in office were consumed with controversies over military service by openly gay men and lesbians and by the deadly government-led raid in Waco, Tex. The New York Times interviewed senior officials from the Clinton, Bush and Obama White Houses who were there for the first 100 days of their administrations. These are their recollections of their setbacks and triumphs as they discovered that they were better off leaving their briefing books at home. Interviews have been condensed and edited. Photo Bill Clinton was sworn in as president by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on Jan. 20, 1993. Credit Jose R. Lopez/The New York Times 1993 Bill Clinton Day 1 approval rating: 58 percent; Day 100: 55 percent Mr. Clinton was managing crises of various degrees from the first days of his presidency. There was the divisive \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy and a public outcry over his first attorney general pick, who had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny. Then the deadly siege in Waco caught the nation and its new president completely off guard. Jan. 14, 1993 The Times reported that Zo\u00eb Baird had employed an undocumented immigrant as her nanny. Mack McLarty Chief of staff As President Clinton said, I think my honeymoon was about 30 minutes. There\u2019s so much to do and so little time. You\u2019re invariably going to have U.F.O.s. Dee Dee Myers Press secretary The Zo\u00eb Baird thing hit , and that sent us into crisis mode. I remember we were in George Stephanopoulos\u2019s office, and President Clinton came in. And we were trying to figure out how to manage this. By today\u2019s standards, of course, it seems like nothing. She had hired people who were in the country illegally as her housekeeper, and the woman\u2019s husband was her driver. We wondered: Were we O.K.? Can we put this back together, if she apologizes and pays back taxes on them? Mark D. Gearan Deputy chief of staff It felt like some of the political pressure and the voices on this were steadier and stronger from outside Washington because, of course, in an urban area it was much more normative. It felt somewhat disconnected from Washington. And there was some need on our part to kind of catch up with the reaction that people had. Myers He wanted an administration that looked like America, and he pledged that his cabinet would reflect that. And the expectation was that one of the big four would be a woman. The secretaries of state, defense, Treasury were all men. The pressure to appoint a woman was substantial. And that complicated the process. Gearan If anything, you go back to 1993 in the context of technology today, social media, broadly the media and how we got information, it seems like I worked for Millard Fillmore or something. It\u2019s extraordinary. Late January 1993 Mr. Clinton had promised during his campaign to look for a way to lift the ban on military service by openly gay men and lesbians. But resistance from leaders of both parties quickly made that impossible. Myers So that blew up. And what made that so challenging was it wasn\u2019t a partisan issue. Sam Nunn [Democrat of Georgia] was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and he basically laid his body down and said, \u201cThis ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d And we were stuck. Colin Powell was against it . We were checkmated early in that game, so the question was: How do you advance the goal of gay and lesbian Americans serving openly in the armed services, or serving at all, with the reality that the public didn\u2019t support it, the Congress didn\u2019t support it and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff didn\u2019t support it? Gearan As part of the distraction, there was the confusion about the policy within the party and on the Hill \u2014 the question of \u201cWhy are we bringing this up? Why did we start with this issue?\u201d There was a sense that this had intentionally been placed on the first-100-day agenda when in fact there were these things that came to him. It\u2019s not like any working memo of the first 100 days recommended \u201cNannygate,\u201d Waco and \u201cDon\u2019t ask\u201d as the legislative agenda. McLarty I used to keep a Waterford dome on my desk that Steny Hoyer [a Democratic congressman from Maryland] gave me, because each one of those members thinks they\u2019re going to be the most important person that you\u2019re going to see that day. And some of them, particularly in the Senate, think they should be sitting there in the Oval Office instead of the current occupant. The Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex., on April 19, 1993. Susan Weems/Associated Press April 19, 1993 The F.B.I. raided the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, leading to the deaths of 76 people, including children. Myers That was horrible for so many reasons. It had been going on already for 50, 60 days. And that\u2019s why the F.B.I. decided to actually raid the compound. All those children. I remember very clearly walking around, everybody had their TVs turned on, and all you could see was flames. And we didn\u2019t know what was in the flames. McLarty We all knew it was high risk and unpredictable. But certainly decisions had to be made to protect the children. Gearan Everything is a case of first impression. In our case, it had been how many years since Democrats were in the executive branch? Our people had been governors and on the Hill. But in terms of the executive branch, the experience was very limited. So everything was through that freshness of the moment. And then there was the learning curve that many of Mr. Clinton\u2019s relatively young staff members had to reckon with as they went to work each day in the White House. Myers Clinton, by nature, is informal. So the culture around him was informal \u2014 much less formal than the Bush culture had been. Neither Bush ever entered the Oval Office without wearing a tie. We didn\u2019t know that. President Clinton would occasionally come to the Oval Office on weekends in a short-sleeve shirt. Some of us would come to work in jeans. When you\u2019re in the epicenter, the cathedral of American politics, everything you do communicates something. Gearan I can remember being in a meeting. It was in the residence, and there are these half-moon-shaped windows. And I recalled seeing these black-and-white photos of Lyndon Johnson sitting in that same place. It\u2019s then you realize the enormity of the burdens on the president. Photo President George W. Bush meeting with members of his national security team in the Oval Office in April 2001. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times 2001 Day 1 approval rating: 57 percent; Day 100: 62 percent Feb. 17, 2001 Compared with the roiling 2000 vote recount, Mr. Bush\u2019s first 100 days seemed off to a tame enough start. Then, barely a month in, he ordered the bombing of Iraqi military installations that President Saddam Hussein was using to interfere with American and British patrols of no-fly zones. Andrew H. Card Jr. Chief of staff We had great discipline. We had a very detailed plan for what the first 100 days should look like, a template: two foreign trips, this economic summit, the cadences of what you have to do. His first trip was to Mexico. And here we are at [President] Vicente Fox\u2019s farm, which was like a ranch, but he called it a farm. We\u2019re getting ready to have a news conference, and all of a sudden I get word that the Defense Department has fired a missile at a radar site in Iraq. Ari Fleischer Press secretary We\u2019re at Fox\u2019s ranch. And Campbell Brown [NBC News White House correspondent] comes up to me and says, \u201cWhy are you bombing Iraq?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d And she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bombing raid going on in Iraq, and you don\u2019t know about it?\u201d So I go into the lunch and pull Condi [Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser] out, and said, \u201cAre we bombing Iraq?\u201d She said no. Then Condi and I go into a secure room. Condi calls Rumsfeld [Donald H. Rumsfeld, the defense secretary] and sure enough. \u2026 Karen P. Hughes Counselor I just remember being totally surprised. I knew our pilots were enforcing the no-fly zone in Iraq. What I didn\u2019t know was that the military had recommended that we take a little more aggressive action. It was the first state visit designed to show that the Bush administration was making our relationship with Mexico and Latin America a priority. Here we are at an event designed to showcase one message, and all of a sudden the message is something else. Fleischer It was all ignored. Everything was dominated by the U.S. bombing Iraq. So that meeting was wiped out. Yellow ribbons adorned a fence in Oak Harbor, Wash., in April 2001 for the crew of an American EP-3 plane that had been detained in China. Dan Levine/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images April 1, 2001 A Navy intelligence plane collided in midair with a Chinese fighter jet near the island of Hainan, forcing the American pilot to make an emergency landing and leading to a standoff between the two countries. Card I remember we had a plan for April, the last month of the 100 days. All of a sudden Slobodan Milosevic gets arrested. And then, I think it was also April 1 or April 2 you had the Chinese force the EP-3 down on Hainan Island. Neither of those were in our 100-day plan. Hughes I still remember looking up at CNN and seeing the banner headline \u201cSpy Plane Standoff.\u201d I came from a governor\u2019s office, and most things you do in a governor\u2019s office don\u2019t show up on CNN. Fleischer That was huge. An EP-3 routine espionage mission over the coast of China, and the Chinese were increasingly aggressive about stopping those missions from taking place. The EP-3 blew a hole in the side, and then a frantic mission went on aboard the plane to destroy all the confidential information. And the closest runway was a Chinese air base. Bush had a lot of latitude to resolve it peacefully. And if something like that did happen, it\u2019s an obvious and immediate test of [President] Trump. We ended up drafting a statement that had the word \u201csorry\u201d in it. We said it wasn\u2019t an apology. We were just sorry that it happened. The Chinese said it was an apology. It was not long, former Bush aides said, before the reality sank in that they were not in a campaign anymore. Card During the transition you\u2019re not dealing with any crises. During the campaign you are dealing with some, but they\u2019re political crises. There are not lives at stake. The world doesn\u2019t understand. And they will test you. And you have to deal with it. Hughes You feel it every day when you walk into the White House, the Oval Office, when you see the president. But that moment when young American lives were at risk, you felt it fully. And then you drive to the White House the very first day. And I remember getting up in my hotel room that day. I was brushing my teeth and my husband walked in and I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to work at the White House today.\u201d He looked at me like I was crazy. But I\u2019m thinking, \u201cI\u2019m just a normal person.\u201d Fleischer That\u2019s a regular part of White House life. You\u2019re just minding your business, going about your day, and something routine goes terribly wrong in some part of the world.

Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times 2009 Approval rating Day 1: 68 percent; Day 100: 65 percent Jan. 20, 2009 Mr. Obama entered the presidency facing the gravest threat to the country\u2019s economic stability in 80 years and quickly got to work on a rescue plan that would not always prove popular. Rahm Emanuel Chief of staff We knew we were going into one of the worst economic moments since the Great Depression. The financial markets were frozen. The auto industry was about to implode. And that\u2019s just on the domestic side. Those were the knowns. David Axelrod Senior adviser There was a sense of absolute urgency of the situation that was drummed into us by these economic reports. Eight hundred thousand jobs lost just in the month of January. Summers [Lawrence Summers, lead White House economic adviser] said we\u2019re going to lose millions of more jobs. Orszag [Peter Orszag, the White House budget director] said this will add trillions to the debt. It was a staggering time. And that\u2019s before you ever get to 180,000 troops in two theaters of war. One thing was clear: There was no time to ease into the job. Jim Messina Deputy chief of staff We thought in the first 100 days we needed to make real progress on the economic stuff. It\u2019s why he got elected and everyone was pushing very hard. We had to be able to walk and chew gum. We had to get the committees to work on health care and on the energy bill, too. For us it wasn\u2019t ever going to be one signature piece of legislation in the first 100 days. We were never going to do that. We\u2019ve got to get a bunch of planes in the air. And that turned out to be messier. March 29, 2009 The White House set stringent conditions for the American automakers General Motors and Chrysler to receive an extension of federal assistance. Messina In the middle of this, it was about the same time the car companies started to fail. Saving Midwestern manufacturing was incredibly important. But those were really tough calls. There was not a lot of public support, after bank bailouts, for a round of car company bailouts. History will judge that as one of the most important decisions he made. Emanuel I always think that the word \u201cbailout\u201d was not the right word. I argued for \u201crestructuring.\u201d It was a bad term. It connoted that people were getting something for free. What the president really said at the end of the day was, \u201cIf you need resources, here are the conditions for it.\u201d And it forced the financial sector, labor, suppliers, dealers to come to the table and make changes that, for too long, they deferred. And now you can see the end result. But a lot of people said, \u201cYou\u2019re throwing good money after bad.\u201d Axelrod There was no guarantee that it would work. Everybody looks back at it now like it was a no-brainer, but there was a lot of money involved and public opinion was very much against. The merchant ship Maersk Alabama in Mombasa, Kenya, on April 11, 2009, after its American captain was kidnapped by Somali pirates. Roberto Schmidt/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images April 8, 2009 Somali pirates hijacked an American cargo ship, the Maersk Alabama. Emanuel That was not in the handbook. Messina There was always something. I remember very early when the pirates happened and [Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.] walked into the senior advisers meeting and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Pestilence?\u201d Axelrod When the pirate thing happened, the president was given 10 minutes to decide whether to authorize the Navy SEALs to take a shot at the pirates. The SEALs were on the water 100 yards away. They said, \u201cWe think we can get the pirates, but we might hit [Capt. Richard Phillips]. And you have 10 minutes.\u201d That\u2019s a day in the life of a president. Even for a White House team that expected the worst and prepared for it, something unexpected always cropped up. Emanuel There were the crises du jour of the knowns, and the crises du jour of the unknowns while you\u2019re making your way through setting up your team and your operation. Axelrod The one thing that you learn very quickly in the White House is that on any given day something can happen \u2014 and will happen \u2014 that can take you off of your plan. I don\u2019t think people appreciate exactly how complex and challenging the presidency is.

(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) 145 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 233 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 When President Trump told a bipartisan meeting of congressional leaders late Monday\u00a0that millions of illegal immigrants had cast ballots against him in the November election, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0says no one in the room \"really gave it much credence, including our Republican colleagues.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., spoke up, telling the president there was no evidence for his assertion that illegal ballots had cost him the popular vote, a charge already debunked by fact-checkers. Schumer\u00a0says the conversation at the closed-door White House meeting then moved on to other topics. But the New York Democrat, who says he hopes to work with Trump on issues including a $1 trillion infrastructure plan unveiled by Democrats on Tuesday, told Capital Download\u00a0that\u00a0\"I worry\" about what the episode may reveal about the new president. \u2022\u00a0 Watch the interview on Facebook Live \"Let me say this: In general you cannot run a country unless you know the facts,\" he told USA TODAY's video newsmaker series . \"If you're going to believe your own facts, whether it's about what Putin is doing in the world or what jobs or companies are doing here, you aren't going to be able to govern, so I worry about it. ... \"President Obama said that the presidency has a sobering effect on people when they take the office, and what I'm doing is hoping and praying\u00a0that that happens.\" Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated that Trump believes that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly three million votes because of massive voter fraud. \"The president ... continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him.\" Only when pressed did Spicer say the administration might call for an investigation. \"Maybe we will,\" he said. Several studies have found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. A report by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated voter-fraud rates were tiny, between 0.00004% and 0.0009%. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.),\u00a0asked about Trump's assertions at Monday's meeting,\u00a0told reporters he has seen \"no evidence\" of rampant voter fraud. In an interview in the historic Mike Mansfield Room in the Capitol, Schumer also said Democrats were hopeful Trump would work with them on a $1 trillion, 10-year infrastructure plan that they say would create 15 million jobs. The president has vowed to enact a massive infrastructure bill, but it's not clear whether the two sides will be able to agree on how to pay for it. Trump advisers have suggested financing an infrastructure bill using tax credits and public-private partnerships. Democrats argue that approach won't work for some of the most needed investments, saying federal spending is necessary. Trump campaigned on a trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal, Schumer noted. \"I've talked with him on the phone and I've said, 'You know, if you're just going to listen to the hard right, you're not going to get anything done.' He acknowledged that. He's going to have to work with us to get this done, and we've shown him a way to go.\" While insisting Democrats' goal wasn't to put a wedge between Trump and congressional Republicans, Schumer acknowledged that might be one effect. \"To get it done, he may have to break with those doctrinaire people who are out of touch with what Democrats and Republicans in America have always supported, which is the federal government should assist in building roads, highways, bridges, tunnels.\" President Trump welcomes Schumer and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as he hosts a reception for congressional leaders in the State Dining Room of the White House on Jan. 23, 2017. \u00a0(Photo: Ron Sachs / POOL, EPA) On other issues, Schumer: \u2022 Predicted the odds were \"50-50\" that Senate Republicans won't be able to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a signature promise by Trump and other GOP candidates. Republicans insist they want to keep the most popular provisions of the law known as Obamacare, including provisions that ensure people with pre-existing medical conditions can buy insurance. But he notes they are divided on how to achieve that and pay for it. Defeating a budget reconciliation measure that would repeal main elements of the law requires 51 votes. In a Senate controlled by Republicans 52-48, that means Democrats would have to be united and win over three Republicans, a big task. \u2022\u00a0Was optimistic a bipartisan proposal that would prevent Trump from lifting Russian sanctions without congressional approval would pass the Senate \"with 80 or 90 votes.\" He and other sponsors, including Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, have asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to allow a vote on the proposal.\u00a0\"If he doesn't, we'll try to figure out procedurally how we can get a vote on it.\" \u2022\u00a0Called the massive\u00a0Women's March on Washington, and similar marches across the country Saturday, a sign of \"the depth of worry about where this president is taking us.\" He said the message for Democrats was \"that we have a lot of support when we try to hold the president's feet to the fire and stick with our values, more support than we ever imagined, and people are counting on us.\" ",

The Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Maryland, many of whose members are Jewish, invited the former first couple in a letter Monday, the report said, which said they could become \u201cspecial members.\u201d \u201cIn the current deeply polarized political environment,\u201d Barry Forman, the club\u2019s president, wrote, \u201cit is all the more important that Woodmont be a place where people of varying views and beliefs can enjoy fellowship and recreation in a relaxed environment.\u201d \u201cGiven our legacy,\u201d he added, \u201cit is regrettable that we have now been portrayed as unwelcoming and intolerant, because that is not who we are.\u201d The report said that a vocal minority at the club opposed the idea of Obama joining because of his record clashing with the Israeli government, including his administration\u2019s decision to abstain in December during the vote on the United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank. One member, Faith Goldstein, wrote to Forman, according to The Washington Post, saying that Obama \u201chas created a situation in which Israel\u2019s very existence is weakened and possibly threatened.\u201d \u201cHe is not welcome at Woodmont,\u201d she reportedly wrote. As special members of the club, the former first couple doesn\u2019t have to pay the $80,000 initiation fee, but must pay dues and other fees, the Times said. The former first family is currently on vacation in Palm Springs, California and is expected to return to Washington and live in the posh Kalorama neighborhood in the Northwest quadrant . \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

By NICHOLAS FANDOS Continue reading the main story Photo Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, during a briefing on Tuesday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 During a private meeting with congressional leaders on Monday, President Trump asserted that between three million and five million unauthorized immigrants had voted for his Democratic opponent and robbed him of a victory in the national popular vote. There is no evidence to support the claim, which has been discredited repeatedly by numerous fact-checkers . That did not stop Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, from standing by the president\u2019s words on Tuesday during a briefing with reporters at the White House. \u201cAs I said, I think the president has believed that for a while based on studies and information he has,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. That much appears to be true. Mr. Trump repeatedly raised doubts about the integrity of the American voting system in the period before the election in November and has falsely said since his victory that millions of people voted illegally. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 27, 2016 Pressed to present the evidence on Tuesday, Mr. Spicer appeared to conflate two different studies that Mr. Trump\u2019s staff had previously cited in defending his claim. \u201cThere\u2019s one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cThere\u2019s other studies that have been presented to him.\u201d Here are the facts Neither study Mr. Spicer apparently referred to supports Mr. Trump\u2019s claim. The first study was conducted in 2014 by professors at Old Dominion University and discussed on Monkey Cage , a blog hosted by The Washington Post. Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, the researchers found that 14 percent of noncitizens who responded to the survey in 2008 and 2010 said they were registered to vote. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The problem is that the study relied on flawed data and was roundly criticized by political scientists who said that a more careful examination of the data revealed no evidence that noncitizens had voted in recent elections. The second study , conducted in 2012 by the Pew Center on the States, found that 24 million voter registrations were no longer valid or \u201csignificantly inaccurate\u201d; that more than 1.8 million dead people were still listed on the voter rolls; and that almost three million were registered in multiple states, probably because they had moved from one state to another.

    "text": "By christina capatides CBS News January 24, 2017, 5:28 PM Badlands National Park Twitter account goes rogue, starts tweeting scientific facts The recent posts by Badlands National Park in South Dakota. @BadlandsNPS/Twitter Email Last Updated Jan 24, 2017 6:33 PM EST Just days after The National Park Service (NPS) was forced to shut down its Twitter activity over two retweets the Department of the Interior deemed inconsistent with the agency\u2019s mission, the Twitter account for Badlands National Park in South Dakota seems to have gone rogue, tweeting numerous scientific facts about climate change that have since been deleted. The first tweet about climate science came at 11:40 a.m. local time Tuesday. It said: \u201cThe pre-industrial concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million (ppm). As of December 2016, 404.93 ppm.\u201d @BadlandsNPS/Twitter Just moments later, the same account tweeted, \u201cToday, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years\u201d \u2014 with the hashtag \u201c#climate\u201d added for good measure. @BadlandsNPS/Twitter Then, at 12:25 p.m., the next tweet said: \u201cFlipside of the atmosphere; ocean acidity has increased 30% since the Industrial  Revolution. \u2018Ocean Acidification\u2019 #climate #carboncycle\u201d @BadlandsNPS/Twitter But the messages were short-lived. As of 5:35 p.m., all the above tweets have been deleted. In response to that action, Democratic National Committee press secretary Adrienne Watson released the following\u00a0 statement : \u201cVladimir Putin would be proud.\u201d\u00a0 This comes as the Trump administration has instituted a temporary media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency, causing the EPA\u2019s social media accounts to fall silent after Friday\u2019s Inauguration Day.\u00a0 President Trump's promised roll back on environmental protection, combined with his belief that climate change is a hoax, has environmentalists a... The EPA\u2019s final tweet before the social media blackout simply reads, \u201c@GinaEPA shares a report about actions taken by the agency under the Clean Air Act during the last eight years,\u201d with a link to a blog post by now-former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. While the main National Parks Service Twitter account is now back up and tweeting, its posts since the temporary halt at that agency have remained largely innocuous: benign tweets about new research libraries, sled dogs in Denali and the motivational power of the mountains. Those posts seem certain not to rub the Trump administration the wrong way. Badlands\u2019 posts on the carbon cycle and climate change , however, seem to have proven otherwise.\u00a0 President Trump has, in the past, tweeted that he believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by China. During their confirmation hearings, however, several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees disagreed with that notion, including ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt , Trump\u2019s choice to take over the EPA. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer answered a question from the Huffington Post\u2019s Jennifer Bendery on climate change \u2014 specifically, about the fact that 2016 was the hottest year on record and how President Trump plans to deal with that fact \u00a0\u2014 by saying, \u201cHe\u2019s going to meet with his team and figure out what policies are best for the environment. One of the things he talked about during the campaign is there\u2019s a balance, and he\u2019s trying to make sure we use our resources appropriately, that we maximize things to make sure that we don\u2019t do so at the detriment of economic growth and job creation.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Aldridge, Cincinnati Enquirer Published 4:36 p.m. ET Jan. 24, 2017 | Updated 51 minutes ago CLOSE x Share After taking the oath of office to become the 45th president of the United States, President Trump addressed the nation, pledged to \"rebuild our country and restore its promise for all our people.\" USA TODAY NETWORK If we don't like the tone we're hearing from our country, perhaps we need to check our own. Graffiti in Wellsville, N.Y., on Nov. 9, 2016. (Photo: Brian Quinn, Brian Quinn, Wellsville Daily Re) \"America will never be destroyed from the outside . If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Abraham Lincoln I'm worried\u00a0about the future of America. Not because of President Trump or his policies, or Russia, or the Islamic State. I worry because of us. Racist, homophobic graffiti was spray painted at Withrow University High School this past weekend. \"We the People\" seem to have forgotten how to treat one another like, well, people. Hostility and meanness seem to be the order of the day, and I find myself wondering, when did America's citizens become one of America's\u00a0enemies?\u00a0Our political discourse\u00a0has\u00a0become so corrosive, so divisive that its primary casualty has been common decency and respect. We excel at dehumanization these days and have\u00a0stopped looking at one another as\u00a0fellow countrymen wanting to create a more perfect union. Instead, we view one another with suspicion and contempt, reducing our neighbors\u00a0to a\u00a0label: Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, libtard, tea bagger, alt-right. I often\u00a0scratch my head about how I, a black, middle-class pastor born in a blue-collar steel mill town in the middle of the Rust Belt, could be labeled a \"coastal elite.\" It would be funny if it weren't such a serious problem. It's easy to blame President\u00a0Trump or Barack Obama for the divisions in our country, but that lets each of\u00a0us\u00a0off the hook way too easily. We play a part in this too \u2014 a bigger one than any president. (After all, who elects them?)\u00a0While Trump controls his personal Twitter account, he doesn't have access to\u00a0your social media. Each of us decides what\u00a0message we\u00a0want to send out to the world, and if we\u00a0don't like the tone we're hearing from our country, then perhaps we\u00a0need to check our own. Trump's inspired call for unity: Column Luke 6:45 says, \"A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart, for the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.\" Whether you're a believer\u00a0or not, it's hard to argue the truth this passage of scripture contains. What comes out of our mouths\u00a0reveals what is truly in our hearts. And if this is true, then based on the rhetoric that is being spoken on all sides, it is safe to say America has a serious heart problem. Each of us must do an honest assessment of ourselves and the words we are speaking to one another. Words contain power. I fear that we are killing one another and our country with thoughtless, careless and destructive language that is pushing us farther apart rather than bringing us closer together. We seem to care more about the number of LIKES on our snarky Facebook and Twitter posts, than engaging in real conversation or gaining true understanding. However, there are two things I believe each of us can do to help our country correct course.\u00a0The first thing is learn to listen more. This is not just simply hearing someone else's words, but actively listening to those words, feelings and thoughts. Many of us enter conversations to win the debate. Many of us don't actively listen, we just wait for our turn to speak. Many of us only like to hear\u00a0points of view that support our own. I've engaged with a number of Enquirer readers whom\u00a0I disagree\u00a0with politically, but through our dialogue I've gained perspective. Sometimes, these readers and I even discover there are more things we agree about than we disagree about. The second thing we can do is make sure our words matter. It's not how much you say, but it's making what you say count. Are your words making an impact or is it just chatter? Are you contributing to the conversation or trolling? Right now, there is a lot of noise out there that, unfortunately, is drowning out real, constructive conversations. Political correctness is dead\u00a0and has been replaced by a spare-no-feelings, tell-it-like-it-is\u00a0attitude. I'm not a fan mainly because, as a communicator, I understand that it's not so much what you say as how you say it. Being politically correct doesn't mean that you can't or shouldn't speak truth, it is just the recognition that I need to take other people's feelings and dignity into account when I speak. I value frankness as\u00a0much as anyone, but our words carry more impact if they are not weighed down by rudeness and baseless stereotypes. ",

    "text": "By Ashley Welch CBS News January 24, 2017, 5:03 PM Do burnt toast and potatoes pose a real cancer risk? New dietary guidelines in the U.K. are urging the public to avoid overly browned toast, but is it really a health risk? Getty Images/iStockphoto Email This week, Britain\u2019s Food Standards Agency (FSA) launched a public health campaign warning people about the potential risks of eating burnt toast, overly crisped potatoes and other starchy foods cooked at high temperatures. The agency is urging people to reduce their intake of these foods and only eat them lightly browned, not burned to a crisp. The advice stems from animal studies that show the chemical acrylamide \u2013 a naturally-occurring compound which is responsible for the brown or black color when starchy foods are toasted, fried, baked, or roasted \u2013 is linked to cancer in mice. But the link has not been proven in humans and experts say there\u2019s scant evidence of any actual risk for people eating normal quantities of toasty food. \u201cLooking at different studies in people, there isn\u2019t a clear and consistent link between acrylamide and increased risk of cancer ,\u201d reads a statement from Cancer Research UK, following the release of the FSA\u2019s dietary guidelines. Acrylamide forms when sugars, water and amino acids are heated together at high temperatures. The higher the temperature and the longer the heating time, the higher the levels of acrylamide. The FSA\u2019s \u201cGo for Gold\u201d campaign urges consumers to \u201caim for a golden yellow color or lighter when frying, baking, toasting or roasting starchy foods like potatoes, root vegetables and bread.\u201d \u201cOur research indicates that the majority of people are not aware that acrylamide exists, or that they might be able to reduce their personal intake,\u201d Steve Wearne, director of policy at the FSA, said in a statement. \u201cWe want our \u2018Go for Gold\u2019 campaign to highlight the issue so that consumers know how to make the small changes that may reduce their acrylamide consumption whilst still eating plenty of starchy carbohydrates and vegetables as recommended in government healthy eating advice.\u201d He continued: \u201cAlthough there is more to know about the true extent of the acrylamide risk, there is an important job for Government, industry and others to do to help reduce acrylamide intake.\u201d However, some experts say the advice may unnecessarily cause alarm and detract from focusing on much bigger cancer risk factors \u00a0like smoking and obesity. \u201cThe most important thing to say following today\u2019s news is not to panic if you had burnt toast this morning or crispy potatoes with your Sunday roast,\u201d Cancer Research UK says on its website. Amanda Bontempo, an oncology dietitian at NYU Langone\u2019s Perlmutter Cancer Center, agrees that the new campaign should not frighten the public and says that the potential hazards of dietary acrylamide exposure \u201cmay be misqualified and misrepresented.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the doses of acrylamide used in these animal studies are 1,000 to 100,000 times higher than any amount that people would be exposed to in dietary sources,\u201d she told CBS News. \u201cSo there\u2019s really no good evidence of harm let alone cancer in humans in the amounts that we eat in our diet.\u201d Bontempo said she would encourage people to consume less of foods that are high in acrylamide such as chips , fries, cakes and other baked goods \u2013 but not because they contain the compound. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to limit those things because they are processed foods that have hidden sugars that we tend to overeat, not because of the possible acrylamide,\u201d she said. \u201c Obesity alone is responsible for 1 in every 5 cancers in the United States. We need to be focusing on that.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

At right, Governor Greg Abbott at a press conference on February 18, 2015, in Austin, Texas.&nbsp;</p> Close Travis County Sheriff's Office/Getty/CBS News composite AUSTIN, Texas - Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday told Austin\u2019s sheriff that her jail would become the first in the state to lose taxpayer money over so-called \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d policies unless she reverses plans to curtail working with federal immigration authorities by February.\u00a0 The governor has previously threatened other \u201csanctuary cities\u201d in Texas, and ultimately did not withhold funds. President Donald Trump made similar vows as a candidate , declaring that his \u201cDay One\u201d priorities would include stopping all federal dollars to places where local officials rebuff federal agents and don\u2019t arrest or detain immigrants living in the country illegally. Several big cities, including New York and Chicago, already have formal sanctuary policies on the books. Sanctuary cities prepare for fight Newly elected Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez on Friday - in a defiantly timed announcement after Trump was inaugurated - said starting Feb. 1 she would end her predecessor\u2019s policy of honoring all jail detainers sought by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Hernandez is a Democrat whose campaign in Texas\u2019 most liberal city partly ran on promises to change how detainers are handled. Abbott, who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, is now effectively threatening to carry out the president\u2019s promise on a state level. Abbott has previously warned local officials against adopting sanctuary policies but has not delivered such a direct ultimatum before now. \u201cYour unilateral decision will cost the people of Travis County money that was meant to protect them,\u201d Abbott wrote. He said funding would be lost by Feb. 1 unless the county changes course. CBS Austin affiliate KEYE-TV reports the letter went on to describe what Abbott thought the consequences of Hernandez\u2019s decision would be, although it\u2019s not clear it provided the data to back up the claim. Abbott claimed that those being released on bond would include ex-cons, \u201c...dangerous criminal aliens convicted of felonies like murder ... will be turned loose into Travis County without permitting ICE the opportunity to collect them.\u201d \u00a0 The only money Abbott has the power to cut off for now is criminal justice grants controlled by his office. Travis County received about $1.8 million of that grant money last year - about 1 percent of the sheriff department\u2019s budget. Both Abbott and the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature are eager to pass new laws by summer that would impose tougher penalties over sanctuary policies. A spokeswoman for Hernandez said she had no immediate comment on Abbott\u2019s letter, but in a video posted to YouTube last week, the sheriff said honoring all federal immigration detainers ties up her deputies and sows distrust between officers and county residents. Detainers are requested when federal immigration authorities, while reviewing jail records, raise concerns about whether a suspect is in the country legally and asks for them to remain jailed so their status can be investigated.

Phillip / Associated Press) Lauren Zumbach Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Fewer people start each morning with a cup of coffee and morning newspaper at their kitchen tables. They're also skipping the ritual in-flight, according to United Airlines. The Chicago-based airline, which used to offer international passengers in first and business classes a selection of newspapers midflight, has canceled its subscriptions. Most customers simply weren't interested, said United spokeswoman Maddie King. \"Reading habits have changed. Most customers are already connected when they're traveling and are consuming news on mobile devices,\" particularly now that more flights have Wi-Fi on board, she said. On an online forum where some passengers noted the papers' absence, a few seemed disappointed, if not surprised, by the switch. Others said they were just as happy to read on a laptop or tablet, or pleased they'd hear fewer passengers noisily unfurling the pages. United isn't abandoning print entirely. A selection of newspapers still will be available in United's airport lounges, and its magazine, Hemispheres, will remain in travelers' seat-back pockets, King said. Both American Airlines and Delta Air Lines still carry print publications for at least some premium class passengers on international flights.

Got it (The Washington Post) By Matt Zapotosky , Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller By Matt Zapotosky , Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller January 24 at 7:10 PM Follow @mattzap Follow @nakashimae Follow @gregpmiller FBI Director James B. Comey was among the senior U.S. officials who had the unpleasant task of traveling to Trump Tower last month to inform the president-elect that Russia had interfered in the election process to help him win office. Then Comey asked his colleagues \u2014 including the CIA director \u2014 to step outside so that he could discuss something even more awkward: a dossier in wide circulation in Washington that alleged that Moscow had gathered compromising financial, political and personal material about the incoming U.S. president. That Comey was asked after that encounter, described by U.S. officials briefed on its details, to stay on as FBI director speaks to his survival instincts and ability to inspire confidence. But the meeting may also have provided a preview of the perilous position he occupies serving in the Trump administration while his agents pursue investigations that seem to lead to the president\u2019s associates. The news that Comey would stay in place became public Tuesday, some time after he began informing senior FBI officials around the country that he had been asked to continue. Under normal circumstances, the revelation might have been unsurprising: Comey is less than four years into a 10-year term, and it is extremely rare for a president to remove an FBI director. But President Trump had notably declined to say whether he would keep the FBI director, telling \u201c60\u00a0Minutes\u201d in an interview after his election that he wanted to meet with Comey first. [ A brief history of President Trump\u2019s comments about FBI Director Comey ] The FBI and White House declined to comment on Comey\u2019s retention. The New York Times was the first to report on the developments. Comey has come under fire from both sides of the political aisle in recent months, especially for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Many Democrats still blame him for Clinton\u2019s loss, and his decisions to discuss the probe publicly in the final months of the race are being investigated by the Justice Department inspector general. His greatest looming challenge, however, will be presiding over ongoing investigations whose dimensions and direction are unclear, but involve Russia\u2019s hacking and interference in the presidential election as well as nebulous ties between Trump associates and Moscow. Those alleged entanglements continue to expand. U.S. officials said this week that the FBI has scrutinized communications between Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The two traded texts and phone calls in late December just as the Obama administration was imposing new sanctions on Moscow, raising suspicion that Flynn and Kislyak were improperly discussing the penalties. U.S. officials, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said they have seen no evidence of wrongdoing. The FBI for several months has been investigating allegations that Trump associates or acquaintances, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, might have had improper contact with Russian officials or intermediaries, U.S. officials said. The bureau is also still examining allegations in the dossier that Comey discussed with Trump in New York last month, according to a U.S. official. The document was assembled by a former British intelligence officer who had been hired by a Washington investigations and political research firm. The contents of the dossier have been in wide circulation among news organizations and law enforcement entities since mid-2016, but it is unclear if any of its potentially damaging allegations have been substantiated by intelligence agencies. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) deemed the document troubling enough that he said he had it delivered to Comey. U.S. officials have said that the author of the document is a respected former spy who has helped the FBI on unrelated cases. Comey, former CIA director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. agreed that they should discuss the dossier with Trump even if the allegations were unproven. The task of having that conversation fell exclusively to Comey, officials said, in part to empty the room of officials, aides and advisers who had taken part in the broader briefing about Russian hacking, but were seen as having no compelling need to be involved in the discussion of the dossier. The ensuing conversation came with seemingly unavoidable conflicts. It is not clear whether Comey told Trump that the FBI had or was still pursuing allegations made in the dossier, but doing so would have involved telling an incoming president with significant power over the FBI that his associates were potential investigative targets. At a news conference Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump \u201chas not made any indication that he would stop an investigation of any sort.\u201d Trump has railed at the decision by the nation\u2019s intelligence chiefs, including Comey, to attach a copy of the dossier to a report released last month by U.S. spy agencies that concluded that Putin had ordered a cyber campaign to disrupt the U.S. election and help Trump . Trump accused U.S. spy agencies of orchestrating a Nazi-like smear campaign against him. The CIA has been the main target of Trump\u2019s hostility in recent months, but he has also been sharply critical of Comey and the FBI. In October, Trump implied that Comey was corrupt for saying publicly that the bureau had not found any incriminating information in a belatedly discovered batch of Clinton emails. But Trump has also praised Comey at times, telling \u201c60\u00a0Minutes\u201d that \u201cI respect him a lot.\u201d At times, it has seemed Comey has few friends in politics. When he announced in July that he was recommending that the Clinton email investigation be closed without charges, Republicans lambasted the FBI director for \u2014 in their view \u2014 coming to the wrong conclusion on the facts he himself laid out. Months later, when Comey revealed to Congress that the probe was back on less than two weeks before the election, Democrats excoriated the FBI for violating long-standing Justice Department policies about taking overt steps in an investigation so close to the day when voters would go to the polls. Even Justice Department officials had advised against Comey taking the actions he did, and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating Comey\u2019s conduct in the case. Comey has said he welcomes the review. The criticism of Comey, though, is not limited to the Clinton investigation. After a recent closed-door briefing from intelligence officials about Russian hacking, some House Democrats called for Comey to resign. They claimed the FBI director was not treating the Trump-related and Clinton-related investigations the same, particularly in his willingness to discuss the matters publicly. \u201cHe should pack his things and go,\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.). Senate Intelligence Committee leaders have said they will explore for themselves alleged links between Russia and the 2016 political campaigns as part of a wide look at the intelligence community\u2019s report on Russian hacking, and some on the left have called for a special prosecutor to be appointed. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s pick to be attorney general, said in a recent response to a questionnaire that he was \u201cnot aware of a basis to recuse myself from such investigations,\u201d though if a \u201cspecific matter arose where I believed my impartiality might reasonably be questioned, I would consult with Department ethics officials regarding the most appropriate way to proceed.\u201d A spokeswoman for Sessions declined to comment for this article. The law would allow Trump to remove Comey, though a president rarely takes such a step out of respect for the independence of the FBI director\u2019s position. President Bill Clinton removed Director William S. Sessions in 1993 amid allegations of ethical improprieties, making him the only director to be removed from his post by the president since 1972 . Trump greeted Comey warmly at a White House reception on Sunday, shaking the FBI director\u2019s hand, patting him on the back and remarking, \u201cHe\u2019s become more famous than me.\u201d Sari Horwitz contributed to this report.

    "text": "Jan 24 2017, 2:01 pm ET Trump Administration Removes LGBTQ Content From Federal Websites by Mary Emily O'Hara advertisement On January 9, Secretary of State John Kerry issued a formal apology for the U.S. Department of State's \"Lavender Scare\"\u2014an internal witch hunt that cost at least 1,000 people their State Department jobs for alleged homosexuality during the 1950s and 1960s. Just two weeks later, that apology\u2014along with nearly every other mention of LGBTQ issues\u2014has been removed from the Department of State website. State.gov NBC News emailed the State Department's press office to ask why LGBTQ content had been scrubbed from the website, and whether such a move is temporary or permanent. In response, a State Department spokesperson stated via email, \"As per standard practice, the Secretary's remarks have been archived,\" and included a link to the archived remarks . However, a search of the State Department's website reveals not much else has changed aside from the removal of LGBTQ content. The Human Rights Campaign condemned the removal in a Monday evening statement , saying, \"The Trump administration appears to be systematically scrubbing the progress made for LGBTQ people from official websites.\" \"Secretary Kerry's apology to LGBTQ employees and their families who were targeted, harassed and fired set the right tone for the State Department, even if it couldn't undo the damage done decades ago,\" HRC President Chad Griffin said in the statement. \"It is outrageous that the new administration would attempt to erase from the record this historic apology for witch hunts that destroyed the lives of innocent Americans,\" Griffin added. \"The apology, along with the other important LGBTQ content that has been removed, should immediately be restored, and President Trump should condemn such behavior at all departments and agencies.\" On Tuesday, it appeared that nearly all mentions of the acronym \"LGBT\" had been taken off the State Department website (the department typically did not include the acronym's \"Q,\" which is used by some\u2014though not all\u2014in the LGBTQ community). Entering \"LGBT\" into the website's search field resulted in numerous dead links where webpages used to house information about LGBTQ Pride month, LGBTQ refugees, LGBTQ human rights issues, human trafficking of LGBTQ people and the Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBT Persons. Kerry's apology and other State Department web pages that mention LGBTQ issues are still available via an archive of the Obama administration websites\u2014as well as on the Wayback Machine, a general internet history archive. The apology on behalf of the department also offered a \"steadfast commitment to diversity and inclusion for all our employees.\" \"In the past - as far back as the 1940s, but continuing for decades - the Department of State was among many public and private employers that discriminated against employees and job applicants on the basis of perceived sexual orientation, forcing some employees to resign or refusing to hire certain applicants in the first place. These actions were wrong then, just as they would be wrong today,\" Kerry said in the January 9 statement. NBC News reached out to Sen. Ben Cardin, whose November letter to John Kerry about the Lavender Scare was part of the impetus for the State Department's formal apology. In response, Cardin released a statement that said, in part: \"This is alarming to me. I encourage the Administration to make its public information portals reflective of all Americans and our values, and I will be monitoring this closely. We cannot and will not turn back the clock on the hard-fought civil rights of the LGBT community. Instead we must strengthen and expand them. I am continuing to ready legislation to compel the State Department to review its actions during the Lavender Scare and make amends.\" HRC and other LGBTQ advocacy groups also condemned the Trump administration for removing all mention of LGBTQ people from the White House website on the day of Trump's presidential inauguration. On Friday, Lambda Legal CEO Rachel Tiven said the scrubbing of LGBTQ content was no surprise given Trump's largely anti-LGBTQ cabinet picks. \"Donald Trump has already nominated a startlingly antigay cabinet, and erasing us from the White House website signals how he truly feels about LGBT people and everyone living with HIV,\" Tiven said . \"Donald Trump is already sending a clear signal that he has no intention of serving as the president of all Americans.\" In addition to the State Department and White House removals, LGBTQ content has also been scrubbed from other federal agency websites. A report titled \"Advancing LGBT Workplace Rights\" was removed from the U.S. Department of Labor website, while other LGBTQ-themed webpages remained. LGBTQ pages on other federal agency websites appeared untouched and unaltered. The Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education and Department of Justice websites were just a few that still had LGBTQ content listed as of Tuesday morning. A request for comment was sent to the Trump campaign press office but did not receive an immediate response. Follow NBC Out on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram . Mary Emily O'Hara ",

    "text": "Trump Asks James Comey to Stay On as FBI Director By VERONICA STRACQUALURSI Jan 24, 2017, 11:00 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Asks James Comey to Stay On as FBI Director 0 Shares Email FBI Director James Comey has told top FBI officials that President Trump asked him to stay on as head of the bureau. Comey told the officials on a conference call in recent days. Asked about the report today by ABC News, Trump had no comment. The White House has not responded to ABC News\u2019 inquiries about the news. Comey was appointed by President Obama in 2013 for a 10-year term, but his future at the FBI came into question after his handling of the FBI probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2019s email server . DOJ Objected to FBI Disclosure of New Steps in Clinton Probe, Sources Say On July 5, 2016, Comey held a news conference , announcing that the FBI was recommending no charges be filed against Clinton. Although he called her actions \u201cextremely careless,\u201d he said the FBI concluded there was no evidence that she intended to violate laws. Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee running against Clinton, released a statement the same day calling the FBI\u2019s conclusions part of a \u201crigged system.\u201d \u201cBecause of our rigged system that holds the American people to one standard and people like Hillary Clinton to another, it does not look like she will be facing the criminal charges that she deserves,\u201d Trump said in the statement, later tweeting that it was \u201cunfair.\u201d Then at the end of October, with 11 days until Election Day, Comey sent a letter to members of Congress informing them that the FBI learned of the \u201cexistence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation\u201d into her use of a private email server. The new messages were discovered through a separate FBI investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York. The emails came from Weiner\u2019s now estranged wife, Huma Abedin, who is one of Clinton\u2019s closest aides and worked in the State Department under Clinton. Trump and his supporters praised Comey\u2019s decision to announce the new email review, while Democrats were flabbergasted. Comey\u2019s letter was viewed by leaders in the Justice Department as a break in a long-standing tradition of avoiding actions that could influence an election\u2019s outcome. On Nov. 6, 2016, Comey wrote a second letter to members of Congress , alerting them that the review of the newly discovered emails was complete and the FBI found nothing criminal that would change its July conclusion that Clinton shouldn\u2019t be charged. With the FBI clearing her a second time, Trump criticized Comey and the FBI again. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally rigged system,\u201d Trump said a campaign rally in Michigan. After Clinton lost to Trump in the election, she said she believed Comey\u2019s announcement of the email review 11 days before the election was a turning point in the race. The Justice Department inspector general has opened an investigation into Comey\u2019s and the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation. The probe will look at whether he failed to comply with department policies and procedures by publicly releasing details of the case and announcing that the investigation was being reopened so close to a presidential election. On Sunday, Trump and Comey embraced before cameras during a White House reception to honor law enforcement leaders. \u201cHe\u2019s become more famous than me,\u201d Trump said as he singled out Comey for recognition.

Over the coming decades, some parts of the nation\u2019s coastline will be hit harder than others, the study finds. The report \u2014 co-authored with the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, the South Florida Water Management District, and scientists from Rutgers and Columbia University \u2014 outlined six likely scenarios for sea level rise, ranging in severity from low to extreme, so that communities and the federal government can plan around those likelihoods.\u00a0 In almost all the scientists\u2019 projections, sea level rise will disproportionately affect the coasts of the U.S. Northeast and the western Gulf of Mexico, compared to averages across the globe. Except for Alaska, the report says nearly all of the U.S. coastline is more vulnerable than the global average if more severe scenarios come to pass. In the mildest projected scenario, global sea levels will rise by about one foot by the end of this century. In the worst-case scenario, global sea levels will rise by 8.2 feet.\u00a0 Though eight feet may not sound like a huge number, the consequences would be devastating: researchers have estimated that a lower rise of six feet would be enough swallow up the homes of about six million Americans. Sandy Garcia walks through a flooded street caused by the combination of rising sea levels and the lunar orbit which caused seasonal high tides on September 30, 2015 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Joe Raedle, Getty Images The new report is an update to one issued in 2012, and paints a significantly darker picture of sea level rise. The worst-case scenario outlined in this report is 1.6 feet higher than the worst-case scenario scientists projected for this century just five years ago.\u00a0 What\u2019s behind the growing concern about sea level rise? A major factor, scientists say, is the rapid melting of Arctic ice due to global warming . The Earth saw its third straight year of record-high temperatures in 2016 , while polar ice diminished to record lows.\u00a0 ",

As Italy's central Abruzzo region and its rescue crews coped with the ongoing emergency, a second tragedy unfolded nearby when an emergency helicopter crashed at an Apennine ski resort, killing six people. The twin disasters, which followed a series of earthquakes and weeks of heavy snow , have brought the region to its knees. Thousands of people have been without electricity for over a week and emergency crews have been working around the clock. The helicopter was ferrying an injured skier off the slopes of the Campo Felice ski area when it slammed into a mountainside buried in thick fog. Five crew members and the skier were killed. Emergency workers at the center where rescue efforts at the avalanche-entombed Hotel Rigopiano are being coordinated rushed to the chopper crash site about 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. Crews on the ground at the scene hugged one another in solidarity. The death toll from the Jan. 18 avalanche, meanwhile, climbed to 17 on Tuesday with the discovery of 10 more bodies. Twelve people remained missing. Nine people previously had been pulled out alive from the rubble, the last one early Saturday. Firefighters' spokesman Alberto Maiolo said search crews aided by excavators finally were able to penetrate the central part of the hotel for the first time and found bodies in the bar and kitchen area. He said there were no signs of life. \"Logically, hopes fade as time passes, but we are continuing to search and trying to do it as quickly as possible,\" he said. The first funerals were held Tuesday, with crowds gathering under a steady rain outside the hilltop church in Farindola to pay their respects to Alessandro Giancaterino, the hotel's chief waiter. Giancaterino, one of the first victims pulled from the wreckage, had offered to stay for a double shift on Jan. 18 to spare a colleague from having to make his way to the hotel through the snow, which was two to three meters (six to 10 feet) high in some places. \"He was a great, hard worker. He was very professional,\" said his brother, Massimiliano Giancaterino. \"This is the memory that I want to keep of my brother, beyond obviously the private ones that I keep in my heart.\" Prosecutors are investigating whether a series of missed communications, underestimations of risks and delays in responding to days of heavy snowfall contributed to the toll from the avalanche. In addition, they are looking into the original construction of the isolated resort and whether it should have been open for business at all in such conditions. Giancaterino, who is also a former mayor of Farindola, said it was useless to speculate now, while an investigation was just beginning, about whether the tragedy could have been avoided. \"Now it is not the time for hypothesis,\" he said. \"It is the time of pain and above all my thoughts go to the friends and relatives of those who are still missing,\" he said. Two of the avalanche's youngest survivors, Samuel Di Michelangelo and Edoardo Di Carlo, were discharged from the hospital on Tuesday. Officials have confirmed that Edoardo's parents were killed in the avalanche, while Samuel's are still unaccounted for. Before their release, the boys had a video conference call with one of their heroes: Argentine forward Paulo Dybala, one of Italian team Juventus' standout soccer players. \"He's very sensitive about these types of things and was happy to participate,\" a Juventus spokeswoman said, on customary condition of anonymity. Two other survivors, Vincenzo Forti and Giorgia Galassi, briefed police for several hours Tuesday and returned to their home on the Adriatic coast in Giulianova. Galassi told reporters outside her parents' home that she was reticent to speak publicly about the couple's ordeal, saying she wanted to respect the people who died and those still waiting to learn the fate of their loved ones. \"I respect them. I have lived the same experience. I knew everyone,\" she said, Forti by her side. \u2014\u2014\u2014 DeCristofaro reported from Penne. AP Writer Colleen Barry contributed from Giulianova, Italy.

Michael Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were first reported by the Washington Post . The conversations between Flynn and Kislyak took place in late December, around the time that then-President Barack Obama announced sanctions against Russia and expelled 35 diplomats in response to Moscow's meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign. Flynn had been investigated for the past five months as part of a broader probe of Russia's ties to the Trump campaign, which is ongoing. That investigation was initiated last spring and involves an interagency task force that includes representatives from the\u00a0FBI, CIA, NSA and Treasury Department. At least three members of the Trump campaign were the focus of the investigation.\u00a0 At one point in the larger investigation, the FBI requested four warrants from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, commonly known as the FISA court. At least one of the warrants was granted and at least one other was not. It is not known whether any of the warrants specifically dealt with Flynn's contacts with Russian officials, which escalated after the November elections.\u00a0 On Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that the administration had not been informed of any particular investigation and would not interfere with any probe. Spicer added that Flynn told him Sunday night that Flynn and Kislyak spoke twice in late December. During the course of those conversations, Flynn said the men exchanged Christmas greetings and discussed a Dec. 25 plane crash that killed members of a Russian military choir, peace talks in Syria and plans for a post-inauguration phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

By Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin By Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin January 24 at 1:25 PM Follow @StevenMufson Follow @eilperin President Trump signs executive orders on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines saying, \"we are going to renegotiate some of the terms.\" (Reuters) President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines, another step in his effort to dismantle former president Barack Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. He also signed an executive order to expedite environmental reviews of other infrastructure projects, lamenting the existing \u201cincredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process.\u201d \u201cThe regulatory process in this country has become a tangled-up mess,\u201d he said. It remained unclear how Trump\u2019s order would expedite those environmental reviews. Many are statutory and the legislation that created them cannot be swept aside by an executive order. Indeed, Trump\u2019s order on the Dakota Access pipeline left some ambiguity. The executive order directs the Army Corps of Engineers to \u201creview and approve in an expedited manner, to the extent permitted by law.\u201d Trump said that both pipeline projects would be subject to renegotiation. His order for the Keystone XL project \u201cinvites\u201d the company to \u201cre-submit its application.\u201d In an Oval Office signing before reporters, the president hinted at a possible new wrinkle. He said he would want any new projects to make use of American steel, though that requirement is not mentioned in his executive order. \u201cI am very insistent that if we\u2019re going to build pipelines in the United States, the pipe should be made in the United States,\u201d he told reporters. The orders will likely have an immediate impact in North Dakota, where the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners wants to complete the final 1,100-foot piece of the 1,172-mile pipeline route that runs under Lake Oahe. The pipeline would carry oil from the booming shale oil reserves in North Dakota to refineries and pipeline networks in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other Native American groups have been protesting the project, which they say would imperil their water supplies and disturb sacred burial and archaeological sites. The Army Corp of Engineers called a halt to the project in December to consider alternative routes. The protest of an oil pipeline that is being constructed close to the Standing Rock Indian reservation has become a rallying point for Native Americans across the United States. Here's what you need to know. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) The tribe is expected to return to court in a bid to block the project. Last week the tribe asked remaining protesters \u2014\u00a0about 500 to 700 of whom were still in the main camp near the pipeline site \u2014 to leave and return to their homes. The camp is in a flood plain, and heavy snow could pose dangers when it starts melting. [ Voices from Standing Rock: Six views from the angry prairie standoff over the pipeline ] The executive order from Trump on the Keystone XL pipeline threatens to undo a major decision by Obama, who said the project would contribute to climate change because it would carry tar sands crude oil, which is especially greenhouse gas intensive because of the energy it takes to extract the thick crude. Obama\u2019s announcement followed a similar finding by the State Department, which has reviewed applications for cross-border pipelines. TransCanada, the Calgary-based project owner, has said it would be interested in reviving the pipeline. But it was unclear what Trump\u2019s caution about renegotiation would mean for TransCanada\u2019s plans. Originally, TransCanada had planned to get about 65 percent of the steel pipe from U.S. manufacturers but other supplies from Canada. On Tuesday, Trump said: \u201cFrom now on, we\u2019re going to be making pipeline in the United States. We build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. We\u2019re going to put a lot of workers, a lot of skilled workers, back to work. We will build our own pipeline, we will build our own pipes, like we used to in the old days.\u201d [ On White House website, Obama climate priorities vanish, replaced by Trump\u2019s focus on energy production ] Speaking to reporters Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the president supported energy projects \u201clike Dakota and the Keystone Pipeline, areas that we can increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into America\u2019s energy supply more, that\u2019s something that he has been very clear about.\u201d Referring to comments Trump has made during the campaign and after the election, Spicer said: \u201cHe was talking about that being a big priority. That\u2019s one of those ones where I think that the energy sector and our natural resources are an area where I think the president is very, very keen on making sure that we maximize our use of natural resources to America\u2019s benefit.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s good for economic growth, it\u2019s good for jobs, and it\u2019s good for American energy,\u201d Spicer added. President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the timeline for the Keystone XL pipeline project. (Reuters) As news of the move surfaced Tuesday morning, oil industry officials hailed it as overdue. \u201cMaking American energy great again starts with infrastructure projects like these that move resources safely and efficiently,\u201d said Stephen Brown, vice president of federal government affairs at Tesoro Companies. \u201cWe are pleased to see the new direction being taken by this administration to recognize the importance of our nation\u2019s energy infrastructure by restoring the rule of law in the permitting process that\u2019s critical to pipelines and other infrastructure projects,\u201d said Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute. Many lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), backed the president\u2019s bid to revive the pipelines. Environmentalists, by contrast, vowed to continue to fight the two pipelines. Greenpeace Executive Director Annie Leonard noted in a statement that a broad coalition of opponents \u2014 \u201cindigenous communities, ranchers, farmers, and climate activists\u201d \u2014 managed to block the projects in the past and would not give up now. \u201cWe all saw the incredible strength and courage of the water protectors at Standing Rock, and the people around the world who stood with them in solidarity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stand with them again if Trump tries to bring the Dakota Access Pipeline, or any other fossil fuel infrastructure project, back to life.\u201d \u201cWe will resist this with all of our power, and we will continue to build the future the world wants to see,\u201d she added. 1 of 20 ",

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Philip Bump By Philip Bump January 24 at 2:56 PM Follow @pbump The Post's Michelle Ye Hee Lee explains why White House press secretary Sean Spicer's claims on Jan. 24 about voter fraud in the presidential election don't add up. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Technically, the proper way to describe claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election is to state that there\u2019s no evidence that it happened. Shortly after the election, we tallied up reports of in-person voter fraud that occurred last year and found a grand total of four examples . There is no evidence that there was fraud at any significant scale at all. Saying this, that there\u2019s no evidence, is a hedge. We say it just in case somehow there emerges evidence that, indeed, hundreds of people registered to vote illegally and went to cast ballots. If we say it didn\u2019t happen and then some evidence emerges, we are stuck. So we say \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence\u201d instead of \u201cit didn\u2019t happen.\u201d That\u2019s on the scale of hundreds of votes. On the scale of millions of alleged fraudulent votes, though? It didn\u2019t happen. There\u2019s not only no evidence that it did, it defies logic and it defies statistical analysis to insist that millions of votes were cast illegally in the 2016 election. [ Here\u2019s how rare in-person voter fraud is ] Some, like Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), roll sketchy rumors down snowy hills to come up with fantastical snowballs of numbers that are unlinked to reality. To NBC on Tuesday, King said that he had extrapolated outward from one report of illegal voting in Virginia to assume that perhaps 2.4 million people had voted illegally nationally. He appears to be referring to a report covered by the conservative media that looked at voting from 2005 to 2015 \u2014 not 2016. If there was rampant fraud in most counties in 2016, no one has detected it. That includes the Republicans who are running the elections in most states. (It\u2019s generally Democrats who are assumed to be the fraudsters.) It also includes statisticians, who have looked for mathematical markers of unusual vote surges and found nothing . King\u2019s not alone in such elaborate mathematics. Often operating from the assumption that voter fraud exists, any number of people have woven elaborate tapestries to present a gauzy case for the presence of fraud in our elections. Were it just the Steve Kings of the world who were embracing this idea, that would be problematic. But on Tuesday, King was responding to a question driven by no less a figure than the new president of the United States, Donald Trump. The day before, Trump met with congressional leaders and reiterated a claim that millions of people had voted illegally for his opponent. In fact, he upped his estimate from 3 million to as many as 5 million \u2014 3.6 percent of all votes cast in the election. There are various levels at which this is total unsubstantiated nonsense \u2014 a claim even more nonsensical than his assertion that 1.5 million people attended his inauguration . The idea that millions of people voted illegally stems most immediately from one tweet from one guy in Texas that was picked up by the conspiracy-hawking site InfoWars. Repeatedly asked for proof of his claim that millions had voted illegally, that guy, Gregg Phillips (who is associated with a group called True the Vote), repeatedly declined to do so. There\u2019s simply no available evidence that Phillips\u2019s claim was true. (True the Vote also declined to substantiate his claims.) What\u2019s more, Phillips himself admits that the 3-million-vote number he threw out doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all of these alleged illegal voters backed Hillary Clinton. So Trump took that number, added a possible 2 million more and asserted that all of those ballots were cast in opposition to him. Why? Probably for the same reason that he lied about the turnout at his inauguration: to make himself look better. If 3 million people voted illegally for Clinton, that would mean that he won the popular vote after all. They didn\u2019t; he didn\u2019t. But that clearly stings. Another likely reason, raised by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in a statement, is that Trump was \u201csending a message to every Republican governor in this country to go forward with voter suppression.\u201d In other words, by making the case for rampant fraud, the case for anti-fraud measures is bolstered. Those measures often disproportionately filter Democrats and people of color out of the voting pool, to Republicans\u2019 advantage. On Tuesday, the situation got worse. Press secretary Sean Spicer, asked to defend Trump\u2019s illegal-vote comments, tried to claim that the claims were rooted in evidence. White House press secretary says President Trump believes millions voted illegally \"based on studies & evidence\" There is no evidence. Zero pic.twitter.com/x6tRV9HTQf \u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) January 24, 2017 There are no studies and no evidence that there is widespread voter fraud in general, much less from the 2016 election. (An election, we will remind you, in which a great deal of attention was paid to the possibility of fraud, given Trump\u2019s having raised it before Election Day \u2014 probably because he expected to lose.) Trump has, in the past, cited a study that looked at errors on the voter rolls that was compiled in 2012. That report, from Pew Trusts, aimed to highlight antiquated voter registration systems by noting that dead people were often not removed from voter rolls quickly. It looked only at data from 2012 and made no assertions about the extent to which those registrations might have been used to cast ballots. But Trump, and others, have highlighted the possibility of 2 million-odd dead voters on the rolls as somehow suggesting that 2 million illegal votes had been cast. During the campaign, Trump also claimed that the illegal voting was being done by immigrants here illegally. At one point, he focused on a statement from a Border Patrol official that conflated illegal entry with illegal voting. The official later clarified that he had misspoken, but the idea that undocumented immigrants have flooded into the country \u2014 particularly into California, where Clinton won overwhelmingly \u2014 has caught hold. Paul Mitchell of California voter-data firm Political Data provided The Post with data on the California electorate. About 1.4 million registered California voters were born in Latin American countries. Just over a million such voters cast ballots in November. If all million of those voters were registered illegally, Trump still needs to find 4 million people elsewhere. But there\u2019s no evidence that any significant number of those million voters were registered illegally. In fact, when Trump\u2019s general election opponents sought a recount in Michigan, his own attorneys said in a court filing that the election was \u201cnot tainted by fraud or mistake.\u201d There\u2019s a deep strain of partisanship involved here. A survey conducted shortly before Election Day found that Republicans agreed with the idea that noncitizens were voting illegally in significant numbers. There\u2019s no evidence that this is the case, but it\u2019s an argument that was being made by the most high-profile Republican in the country. That clearly had an effect. (A study from Dartmouth: \u201c[T]he voter fraud fears fomented and espoused by the Trump campaign are not grounded in any observable features of the election.\u201d) It\u2019s frankly stunning that the president of the United States would make such an assertion, much less make it repeatedly and at ever-increasing levels of error. It\u2019s stunning, too, that his press secretary would claim that there was evidence that the president was correct \u2014 or, it would be stunning had Spicer\u2019s tenure not begun the way it did . The most telling demonstration that Trump\u2019s numbers and Spicer\u2019s defense are nonsensical, though, came from a follow-up question posed to the press secretary. If millions of people voted illegally, Spicer was asked, wouldn\u2019t that demand an investigation into the integrity of the election? (Such an investigation, of course, might put at risk Trump\u2019s narrow margin of victory.) \u201cHe won fairly,\u201d Spicer said of his boss . Ironically, this, at least, was true. 1 of 20 ",

Stanley Carothers III, 30, of the 6200 block of South Ingleside Avenue, is charged with criminal sexual assault of a student at the Chicago Public School where he was a dean. (Chicago Police Department) Steve Schmadeke Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A Chicago Public Schools dean sexually assaulted a 14-year-old student repeatedly at her South Side school starting last spring after she was sent to his office for disciplinary problems, Cook County prosecutors alleged Tuesday. Stanley Carothers III, 29, was the dean of operations at Bradwell School of Excellence, a South Shore turnaround school managed by the Academy for Urban School Leadership, prosecutors said. Assistant State's Attorney Jullian Brevard said the abuse started after the eighth-grader was sent to Carothers' office in March for \"disciplinary matters.\" The dean took the girl to another room and sexually assaulted her, Brevard said. Carothers had sex with the girl at the school or his apartment over the next eight months, even over the summer months, Brevard said. In bond court, Carothers' attorney, Frank Kostouros, denied the allegations, showing Judge Peggy Chiampas a printout of a Facebook message in which the girl allegedly recanted and apologized for the \"setup type situation.\" \"The victim admits she's lying and apologizes,\" Kostouros told the judge. Chiampas ordered Carothers released on a personal recognizance bond with electronic monitoring. Carothers left Bradwell in November for another CPS school and is on unpaid leave, Kostouros said. Prosecutors said the girl first told a classmate about the abuse last spring, but police weren't notified until the girl told a family member in November. The relative contacted Chicago police. Prosecutors said the girl gave a handwritten statement to police and later that same day identified Carothers' apartment. A day after making the statement, the girl had sex again with Carothers, prosecutors said. Authorities later took a second handwritten statement from the girl. Carothers denied allowing any students into his home, prosecutors said. Carothers and the girl began talking over Facebook Messenger in March, prosecutors said, but the dean soon asked the girl to stop texting him to the account under his given name and to instead message him at a profile he controlled under another name, prosecutors said. The two exchanged sexual messages, discussing times and places to meet for sex and referring to prior sexual contact between them, prosecutors said. Carothers left Bradwell in November for another CPS school and is on unpaid leave, Kostouros said. The attorney said in court the girl may have retaliated after Carothers ordered an emergency mental health evaluation for her and she was hospitalized. The teen, who Kostouros said has a history of \"uncontrollable\" classroom behavior, later sent a Facebook message apologizing, he said. \"Hey mr carruthers. I sorry that I lyed on u saying we did stuff,\" said the message, a copy of which Kostouros filed as an exhibit. \"I didt no they was taken it this far. They dared me to do this.\" Carothers, a Morehouse College graduate with a University of Phoenix graduate degree, had never before been arrested, his attorney said. ",

Gorsuch of the federal appeals court in Denver in 2006. He is a graduate of Columbia, Harvard and Oxford University, a former clerk to two Supreme Court justices and a former Justice Department official. Credit John Prieto/The Denver Post, via Getty Images Democrats remain bitter over the refusal of Republicans to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland , and they say they will mount a furious opposition to any candidate out of the legal mainstream. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, has said Democrats were prepared to try to keep Justice Scalia\u2019s seat open indefinitely if Mr. Trump proposes such a nominee. Judge Gorsuch, 49, appointed to the appeals court by President George W. Bush in 2006, was not initially thought to be a top contender. His name did not appear on the first list of 11 potential nominees circulated by the Trump campaign in May, though he did make a second list of an additional 10 names issued in September. Judge Gorsuch\u2019s best-known votes came in decisions concerning regulations under the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to provide free contraception coverage. He voted to accommodate religious objections to the regulations, a position largely upheld by the Supreme Court. In general, Judge Gorsuch\u2019s approach to the law mirrors that of Justice Scalia. He is an originalist, meaning he tries to interpret the Constitution consistently with the understanding of those who drafted and adopted it. And he is a textualist, focusing on the language of statutes rather than what lawmakers have had to say about them. Judge John L. Kane, who was appointed to the Federal District Court in Denver by President Jimmy Carter, said Judge Gorsuch was admired by his fellow judges. \u201cHe writes opinions in a unique style that has more verve and vitality than any other judges I study on a regular basis,\u201d Judge Kane said. Judge Kane said Judge Gorsuch had voted both to affirm and to reverse his decisions. \u201cIn each instance, I have felt I was clearly understood and properly informed,\u201d Judge Kane said. \u201cI think Judge Gorsuch listens well and decides justly. His dissents are instructive rather than vitriolic. In sum, I think he is an excellent judicial craftsman.\u201d Advertisement Judge Pryor is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Senator Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general. When Mr. Sessions was Alabama\u2019s attorney general, Mr. Pryor served as his deputy, succeeding him when he joined the Senate.

    "text": "Privacy Policy Paratroopers\u2019 goal is to fall sideways in the direction the wind is carrying them \u2014 in no way resisting the momentum of the fall. When the balls of their feet barely reach the ground, they immediately distribute the impact in rapid sequence up through the calf to the thigh and buttocks. Then they roll over on the latissimus dorsi muscle, the large, flat muscle running laterally down the side of your back, and kick their feet over, shifting their weight so they end up supine with legs bent in front of them. The procedure is strikingly similar to how martial arts practitioners learn to take a fall when they are, say, thrown over someone\u2019s shoulder or have their legs knocked out from under them. \u201cI would say the principles we follow are: Accept that you\u2019re falling and go with it, round your body, and don\u2019t stiffen and distribute the energy so you take the fall in the widest area possible,\u201d said Paul Schreiner, a black belt jiu jitsu instructor at Marcelo Garcia Academy in New York City. While martial arts falls often have a gymnastic aspect, with rather elegant and snappy kinds of somersaults, it\u2019s still all about spreading out the force of impact. \u201cThere may be an aesthetic component, but what it does is save the body,\u201d said Mr. Schreiner. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take the fall in any single place, you\u2019ll still walk out sore, but you\u2019ll walk out of there.\u201d Difficult as it may sound as you\u2019re hurtling toward the ground \u2014 medical bills and disability flashing through your mind \u2014 experts said it\u2019s important to relax as you fall. You\u2019re less likely to hurt yourself if you soften up all your muscles and exhale. Rigidity is your enemy, while pliability is your friend. \u201cAs unfair as it is, that\u2019s why people who are drunk\u201d tend to be the ones who \u201cdon\u2019t get hurt in car crashes,\u201d said Mr. Inouye. \u201cThey are loose and just flop around.\u201d Of course, you will be better able to loosen up, pivot to your side, tuck and roll if you are in good physical condition. \u201cIf you have a room full of soccer players and computer desk workers and go around knocking people over, you can bet the soccer players are going to be less likely to get hurt because of their superior strength, agility and coordination,\u201d said Erik Moen, a physical therapist in Kenmore, Wash. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be an elite athlete or paratrooper to fall the \u201cright way.\u201d Young children are arguably the best fallers because they have yet to develop fear or embarrassment, so they just tumble and roll without tensing up and trying to catch themselves. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Physical therapists can be helpful in assessing your weaknesses and prescribing do-at-home exercises to improve your strength and agility (for example, jumping from side to side and on and off platforms or steps) so that you will be better able to execute a fall as well as lessen the risk that you will fall in the first place.

    "text": "Jan. 24, 2017, 4:00 p.m. park city, utah Steven Zeitchik Meryl Streep accepts the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 74th Golden Globe Awards. (HFPA / Zuma Press) Decided on by about 7,500 fewer voters than the Oscars -- and with many fewer degrees of credibility -- the Golden Globes are often derided as an awards-show punchline. Who are these 80 entertainment reporters to determine what Hollywood thinks are the best movies of the year, when so many thousands of industry veterans vote on awards just weeks later? But the first group may have had an unusually large effect on the latter this year. When the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and\u00a0Sciences announced its nominations Tuesday morning, it had put \"Elle\" star Isabelle Huppert on the shortlist for lead actress, while leaving out favorites Amy Adams (\"Arrival\") and Annette Bening (\"20th Century Women\"). Huppert's profile was raised dramatically in the critical final days of voting when the Globes gave her an upset victory of sorts in lead actress in a drama award -- then she gave a bubbly speech that played well to the thousands of voters watching. Though\u00a0it's impossible to know how many votes shifted, her elevated stock in the final five days of voting only helped her candidacy. Also nestling its way into voters' minds from the Beverly Hilton ballroom was Meryl Streep, who\u00a0was considered a bubble candidate at best for her role as a bad opera singer in the little-seen \"Florence Foster Jenkins.\" But she became a hero, especially in many precincts of Hollywood, at the Golden Globes, when she gave a fiery anti-Trump speech that included such as lines as \"When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.\" A backlash from Trump and Trump supporters only solidified her status, and Streep's Oscar chances began to steadily rise, until Tuesday she notched an Oscar spot that might otherwise have gone to Adams or Bening. (Whether the Globes speech and its attention prompts Oscar producers to give her a platform at their show as well remains to be seen.) But maybe the biggest contribution the Globes made to the Oscars comes with a polarizing personality: Mel Gibson. Gibson was a somewhat unexpected juggernaut on Tuesday, his \"Hacksaw Ridge\" earning six nominations, including picture and director (both over Oscar darlings Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese). As it turned out, Gibson was nominated for picture and director by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.\u00a0as well. In fact, the group was one of the first to normalize the filmmaker after the string of racist, misogynist and anti-Semitic comments that put him in \"director jail\" a decade or so ago. They invited him to introduce the top honor of motion picture-drama last year at a point when few high-profile shows would have Gibson on. (It devolved into awkward barbs between him and Globes host Ricky Gervais.) Gibson had been shunned by much of Hollywood following the multiple incidents -- so much so that Robert Downey Jr. asked forgiveness for him several years back. The Globes' embrace of Gibson helped pave the way for him to return to Oscar's good graces. The HFPA won't win over skeptics who say the group does not represent people in mainstream Hollywood. But Tuesday's Oscar nominations proves at least one thing: Those people are watching. Latest updates ",

The replacement of the lines is expected to take years. Tuesday's announcement drew immediate skepticism from some Flint residents. Melissa Mays said it \"means nothing. There's still lead in the system.\" \"Especially with disruptions, main breaks \u2014 pieces of lead scale will be breaking off until these pipes are replaced,\" Mays said. \"You cannot tell me the water is safe because you have not tested every home.\" Related: Lead Test Results Confirm Worst Fears for Flint Family Flint's public health emergency began when officials failed to properly treat lead lines for corrosion while the city was under state management. State officials acknowledged the lead problem in October 2015. Lead from old pipes leached into the water supply because corrosion-reducing phosphates were not added due to an incorrect reading of federal regulations. Related: CDC Confirms Lead Levels Shot Up in Flint Kids After Water Switch Elevated levels of lead, a neurotoxin, were detected in children, and 12 people died in a Legionnaires' disease outbreak that experts suspect was linked to the improperly treated water. An ongoing investigation has led to charges against 13 current or former government officials, including two managers that Gov. Rick Snyder appointed to run the city. Snyder has apologized for the crisis that has largely been blamed on his administration. \"The remarkable improvement in water quality over the past year is a testament to all levels of government working together and the resilient people of Flint helping us help them through participation in the flushing programs,\" he said in a statement. \"There is still more work to do in Flint, and I remain committed to helping the residents recover and restore their city.\" While it is important for cities to be below the federal limit, experts say there is no safe level of lead and the crisis has exposed gaps in a monitoring system that can mislead individual homeowners and renters into thinking their tap water is safe when only some homes with lead pipes are sampled. Related: Here's What Lead Can Do to You Michigan's letter to Flint Mayor Karen Weaver was reviewed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before it was sent. Because the city exceeded the federal limit in the first half of 2016, it must continue replacing at least 7 percent of its lead service lines by June 30. Though the requirement may be discontinued if the water supply is at or below the limit in the next monitoring period, the state said it would continue supporting Flint's plan to replace more pipes. The state set aside $27 million for the project as part of the nearly $300 million that has been allocated toward the crisis, including for bottled water, filters and legal bills. Tuesday's announcement means the state will soon stop providing a credit on customers' bills. It has been partially covering their bills dating to April 2014. Starting in March, the state also plans to no longer pay for Flint's water, which comes from a Detroit-area system. The state has been the costs since October 2015. The Associated Press ",

Jefferson Graham , USA TODAY Published 4:26 p.m. ET Jan. 24, 2017 | Updated 2 hours ago 633 Shares x Share Sam Graham (son of #TalkingTech host Jefferson Graham) tells why he switched from 15 years of using Apple computers to Windows and the Surface Pro 4. LOS ANGELES - Remember \"Think Different?\" or those \"Mac vs. PC\" ads featuring a stodgy gent from another era and the ultra-hip Mac dude? Fast forward a few years, and now, thanks to the Surface all-in-one notebook/laptop and a Windows operating system that's not buggy, Microsoft is looking like the cool kid, while Apple has turned into the stale, old company. That, at least, is the opinion of Matt Krantz, the long-time USA TODAY Markets columnist, who recently left for a new gig at a Los Angeles money management firm this week. The Mac vs. PC ads \u00a0(Photo: Apple) Krantz and I sat together for one final #TalkingTech podcast to talk about the dramatic shift in perception for Microsoft. Click the link below to listen. What happened to Apple? Chalk it up to the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. \"He was an amazing person who could sell ice water to eskimos,\" says Krantz. \"Without him, Apple is just a hardware company. You've seen the innovation slowly chip away.\" Since Jobs died, only one major new product has been released, the 2015 Apple Watch, along with upgrades to already popular products like the iPhone, iPad and Macintosh computer. \"Microsoft got forced to innovate,\" Krantz says. \"They saw all the growth with Apple, and knew they had to come up with something better. Being good wasn't good enough.\" Microsoft first introduced the Surface as a tablet meets laptop with a touchscreen surface in 2012. It was Microsoft's first major computer hardware release, and has evolved into a strong seller and innovative product category that's as powerful in a light, totable form factor as more expensive Apple MacBook Pro computers. At one time, Apple owned TV product placement, but now the Surface is being seen on more TV shows, including the CNN set. In the third quarter of 2016, Microsoft said revenue from Surface products realized $926 million, up 38 percent from the $672 million the prior year. That's a far cry from the $5.7 billion reported by Apple for Mac revenue in the fiscal 2016 4th quarter, but Macs are also an older product. Where Microsoft has struggled has been catching up to both Apple and Google in smartphones. The Lumia line is seemingly on its last legs, but several blogs have reported about another try, with a Surface phone/tablet that could come out this year. Microsoft filed a patent recently for a foldable tablet/phone, and Krantz can't wait. \"Smartphones have gotten boring,\" he says. \"It's time for something different. Think of the phone becoming\u00a0becoming your computer and getting down to one device. That's where I think it's going. \" Former USA TODAY markets columnist Matt Krantz, at the USA TODAY Los Angeles bureau \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham) Have a few more minutes to spare?

    "text": "Trump says he\u2019ll announce Supreme Court pick next week Tuesday\u2019s White House meeting with Senate leaders and members of the Judiciary Committee is designed to be a general discussion to see if any names on Trump\u2019s list of 21 potential high court nominees would present problems. It is not designed to elicit specific endorsements or opposition to any specific nominee. From the White House perspective, it is viewed as a gesture of respect of the Senate advise-and-consent role.\u00a0 Both Hardiman and Gorsuch are regarded as conservative, but neither is thought by the White House to be unconfirmable. Nor are they nominees who would, the White House believes, elicit a massive Senate Democratic uprising. That is the working theory, but confirmation fights in the modern era have been unpredictable.\u00a0 There is a sense within the White House that 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018 from pro-Trump states are particularly vulnerable and MAY vote for confirmation -- hence the White House\u2019s desire to move as rapidly as possible to preserve its leverage. Hardiman is a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Originally from Waltham, Mass., Hardiman attended Notre Dame and Georgetown Law School. He worked in private practice in Pittsburgh, then was a hearing office for the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Gorsuch is a former Washington, D.C. lawyer and Supreme Court clerk educated at Harvard and Oxford who is considered a solid conservative. He sailed through his Senate confirmation in 2006, and was even introduced by both the Republican (then-Sen. Wayne Allard) and Democratic (then-Sen. Ken Salazar) senators from his home state of Colorado. Gorsuch\u2019s ascendancy may come as a surprise because legal conservatives had been urging Trump to tap Alabama-based federal appeals court judge William Pryor. A former Alabama deputy attorney general under Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, Pryor was appointed to fill Sessions\u2019 position as Alabama attorney general after he was elected to the U.S. Senate. Pryor is a highly regarded judge who many believe would have been the most worthy successor to Antonin Scalia, but his nomination to the Eleventh Circuit in 2003 was hotly contested. Selecting Hardiman would diversify the high court in one way -- if confirmed, Hardiman would be the only one on the high court without an Ivy League degree. The Massachusetts native became the first person in his family to go to college when he attended the University of Notre Dame. He paid his way through law school at Georgetown by driving a taxi.\u00a0 Democrats filibustered Pryor\u2019s nomination because of his views on abortion \u2013 during his confirmation hearing, Pryor stood by his comments calling Roe v. Wade \u201cthe worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\u201d Ultimately, Bush appointed Pryor to the bench using a recess appointment in 2004, and Pryor was permanently confirmed as part of the Gang of 14 compromise negotiated by Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2005. Republicans on Capitol Hill told Mr. Trump they\u2019re wary of the blowback from Democrats if Pryor were to be his pick. But Pryor also was no favorite of the religious right. Because he is not a results-oriented judge, Pryor does not always reach a conservative outcome. For example, he joined an appeals court opinion supporting transgender rights, consistent with Supreme Court precedent. And as state attorney general, Pryor sought to remove Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore from office after Moore refused a federal court order to remove a massive 10 Commandments rock from the state courthouse.\u00a0 One potential obstacle for Hardiman is a gender stereotyping case, similar to a case that tripped up Pryor with the religious right. Writing for the court, Hardiman\u2019s opinion allowed a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by a gay man describing himself as \u201ceffiminate\u201d to proceed. Mr. Trump\u2019s team believes Gorsuch is significantly less likely to inflame the left, while also being an acceptable choice to the far right. Gorsuch sided with Hobby Lobby in the Obamacare contraception case and wrote a book about assisted suicide that indicated his pro-life views. Before joining the bench, Gorsuch took few if any controversial positions as a D.C. lawyer in private practice or during his brief stint in the civil division of the Bush Justice Department.\u00a0 Hardiman \u200eis also seen as a solid conservative, but with a slightly more enigmatic record. Hardiman serves on the same court as President Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "President Trump's promised roll back on environmental protection, combined with his belief that climate change is a hoax, has environmentalists a... At President Trump\u2019s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, environmental professors like Bethany Wiggin listened carefully to candidate Trump talk about climate change, which is why she, her colleagues and her students are now racing to back up on other servers information available on government websites, CBS News\u2019 Jim Axelrod reported. \u00a0 Temporary restrictions announced on Tuesday -- that EPA employees can no longer post or blog from government accounts -- stoked their fears that the administration will limit access to data as it rolls back environmental protections. \u201cI\u2019m really worried that the facts might become more difficult to access,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s kind of a vulnerability of internet materials already, she said. \u201cThey become more vulnerable still when controlled by an administration who finds them inconvenient.\u201d\u00a0 Staff at the Agriculture Department have also received orders not to release any documents to the public. \u201cThis includes, but is not limited to, news releases, photos, fact sheets, news feeds and social media content,\u201d read the email memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press. Agricultural Research Service spokesman Christopher Bentley said the ban would not include scientific publications released through peer-reviewed professional journals. \u201cAs the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s chief scientific in-house research agency, ARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public as we strive to find solutions to agricultural problems affecting America,\u201d Bentley said, according to a statement. The agency said that \u201cinformation on our projects, people and locations\u201d would still be available on its website. AP reported over the weekend that staff at the Interior Department were temporarily ordered to stop making posts to its Twitter account. The prohibition came after the official account of the National Park Service, a bureau of the department, retweeted a pair of posts to its 315,000 followers that seemed to be a swipe at Trump on his initial day in office. The first was a photo that compared the crowd gathered on the National Mall for Trump to the much-larger gathering that stood in the same spot eight years earlier for President Barack Obama\u2019s swearing-in. Trump later falsely claimed that more than 1 million people attended his inauguration, which Spicer insisted was the most-watched in history. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Fall of TPP Under Trump Signals New Era for American Trade By Michael Edison Hayden Jan 24, 2017, 3:59 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Signs Order to Move Forward Keystone, Dakota Access Pipelines 0 Shares Email President Donald Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday, and critics of the doomed deal say the move will protect American jobs. The withdrawal, which threatens to distance the U.S. from some of its Asian allies, fulfilled a campaign pledge by Trump to end U.S. involvement in the 2015 pact and likely marks the beginning of a new chapter in Washington's approach to global trade \u2014 one more focused on shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. Unlikely Allies Trump, who hopes to boost U.S. manufacturing jobs during his term, signed the executive memorandum authorizing the withdrawal in the Oval Office. Later, as he met with union leaders in the White House's Roosevelt Room, he said, \"We're going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country.\" The move received support from some of his opponents, including Rust Belt Democrats. Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., who denounced the TPP in last year\u2019s Democratic presidential primaries, arguably pushing Hillary Clinton to retract her support for the pact, praised Trump yesterday and said he was glad the deal was \"dead and gone.\" Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks during an event on the Trans Pacific Partnership on Capitol Hill June 3, 2015 in Washington, DC. End of a Long Fight Although the agreement was already considered dead because of its lack of support from either major party's presidential candidate, Trump's signing of the memo nevertheless ended what Thea Lee, the policy director and chief international economist at the AFL-CIO , described to ABC News as a \"six year fight\" to stop the pact. Union leaders like AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa, praised the move in separate statements, suggesting it would protect workers. Union households \u2014 long considered a key component of the Democratic base \u2014 helped Trump win the 2016 presidential election. He matched Ronald Reagan 's support in that cohort in 1984 \u2014 the highest level in that group for a Republican since then, according to ABC News exit polls. Lee, however, was reluctant to praise Trump so easily for signing the directive. \"The TPP was dead already,\" she said. \"Trump just disposed of the body.\" Lee said her organization saw the accord, which President Obama made the centerpiece of his foreign policy pivot toward Asia, as \"deeply flawed.\" She called it a \"corporate empowerment agreement,\" part of a trend of deals that made it easier for companies to ship jobs overseas. Despite her criticisms of the deal, she said she is reserving judgment on whether Trump's promise to fight for American workers can be believed. \"It's hard to say right now what we can expect from his administration,\" she said, since some of his proposed appointees \u2014 who she said are from the \"Goldman Sachs wing of the Republican Party\" \u2014 appear more likely to support future similar trade deals than his rhetoric would suggest. Lee also said that it's still unclear what Trump will seek to do with other trade deals, as with his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. \"Will he label China a currency manipulator?\" Lee asked, referring to one of his promises . \"That still remains to be seen.\" Questions About Cause of Job Losses Mireya Solis, the Philip Knight chair in Japan studies and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, argued in favor of the TPP in the past, praising the agreement for its potential to \"enhance American influence in Asia.\" She told ABC News that the deal would have had a small but positive effect on American jobs and cited a study by the United States International Trade Commission to support that claim. Solis said opponents of the TPP \"are misjudging the problem,\" referring to the much discussed decline in American manufacturing jobs. \"We're very bad at training American workers to reinvent themselves.\" She said that advances in technology were hurting workers more than trade deals like the TPP and that it could have boosted exports. Robert E. Scott, the senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute , who argued against the deal, said the notion that it would have strengthened exports is \"simply not coherent,\" based on the degree to which it would have empowered corporations. Scott, who voiced skepticism about how effective the TPP would have been in strengthening U.S. influence in Asia, said that the framework of the deal was designed to help \"really big companies\" and implied that what would have happened to workers as a result of the deal was an afterthought. \"It would have redistributed wealth from the poor to the ultrarich,\" he said. \"This is a win for workers, in my view.\" 0 Shares ",

President Trump signed documents inviting the company behind the Keystone XL pipeline to resubmit a proposal for the project , which the Obama administration rejected in 2015, and instructing the Army to expedite the review and approval process for the section of the Dakota Access Pipeline that hasn't been built. \"We're going to renegotiate some of the terms, and if they'd like, we'll see if they can get the pipeline built,\" Trump said of the Keystone XL pipeline. \"This not a done deal,\" Bill McKibben of the group 350.org , which has lobbied against pipelines for years, said in a statement. He called the pipelines \"unwise and immoral\" because they contribute to climate change. Trump also signed a document requesting a federal plan to incentivize the use of U.S.-made pipes for pipeline projects. Proposed And Existing TransCanada Pipelines Source: TransCanada Credit: Stephanie d'Otreppe and Alyson Hurt / NPR The lobbying group representing the petroleum industry issued a statement in favor of the policy reversal. A spokesperson for the TransCanada company, which proposed the Keystone XL project, said the company was preparing to resubmit a proposal. Energy Transfer Partners, which is building the nearly completed Dakota Access Pipeline, did not immediately comment. Article continues after sponsorship Both the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline provoked protests from a diverse group of citizens concerned about the climate impacts and potential environmental contamination from the projects, as well as the safety of their routes across large swaths of the country and the mechanisms by which the federal government approved those routes. Dozens, Including Sierra Club Director, Arrested At White House Keystone Protest McKibben promised to fight the president's move, saying, \"The last time around, TransCanada was so confident they literally mowed the strip where they planned to build the pipeline, before people power stopped them. People will mobilize again.\" A portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline is under review by the Army Corps of Engineers, which announced last week that it was gathering information for an environmental assessment of a crossing under the Missouri River in North Dakota \u2014 an area that the nearby Standing Rock Sioux tribe says is sacred land. Demonstrators, sometimes numbering in the thousands, set up several camps on occupied land near the proposed crossing site beginning last summer, in support of the Standing Rock Sioux. The tribe filed a lawsuit against the federal government to block the pipeline, which was retracted earlier this month. The protests diminished after the Army Corps blocked the final permit in December and announced it would reassess the pipeline route, taking into account concerns about the risk of water contamination and allegations that the tribe was not adequately consulted about a route that violated sacred land. On Tuesday, the tribe released a statement through the American Civil Liberties Union, promising to take legal action against the federal government. In Victory For Protesters, Army Halts Construction Of Dakota Pipeline \"Trump's decision to give the go-ahead for the Dakota Access Pipeline is a slap in the face to Native Americans and a blatant disregard for the rights to their land,\" it stated. The tribe also addressed the president's stated plan to streamline what he called the \"incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process\" for environmental reviews of pipeline and manufacturing projects. \"The Trump administration should allow careful environmental impact analysis to be completed with full and meaningful participation of affected tribes,\" the Standing Rock Sioux wrote in its statement. Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota released a statement praising the president's actions, calling the pipelines \"crucial energy infrastructure projects\" and saying they would create jobs. Demonstrators remain camped on the North Dakota prairie in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. They've winterized tents and other structures. Amy Sisk/Prairie Public Radio hide caption toggle caption Amy Sisk/Prairie Public Radio Demonstrators remain camped on the North Dakota prairie in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. They've winterized tents and other structures. Amy Sisk/Prairie Public Radio Amy Sisk of Prairie Public Radio was at the site on Tuesday and reports that demonstrators remain camped on the North Dakota prairie near the site where the Dakota Access Pipeline's slated to cross under the Missouri River. \"They're living in winterized tents, tepees and wooden structures, many keeping warm by fireplaces installed inside their makeshift homes,\" she tells us. \"Demonstrations have slowed this winter in the wake of the December announcement that the Army Corps of Engineers would launch a new environmental review of the pipeline. Word that Trump has begun the process of expediting this review and advancing the project spread quickly through camp Tuesday. For many, this did not come as a surprise. \"Protesters vow to continue their stand against the pipeline. But the camp's future is in limbo, amid flooding concerns after a heavy winter snowfall. And the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has asked protesters to leave. Some I talked to are moving to higher ground so as to avoid the floodplain, yet continue the fight as the Trump administration weighs in.\" ",

USA TODAY Jennifer Lawrence on De. 1, 2016, promoting 'Passengers' in London. (Photo: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP) 619 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A Chicago man was sentenced Tuesday to nine months in prison for hacking the electronic accounts of 30 celebrities and stealing private information, including nude videos and photos. Edward Majerczyk, 29, also was ordered to pay $5,700 in restitution for counseling services for one undisclosed celebrity victim whose photos were disseminated online. Majerczyk is accused of orchestrating a \"phishing scheme\" that illegally accessed more than 300 email and other online accounts, including those belonging to actress Jennifer Lawrence. According to his plea deal, Majerczyk sent emails to his victims that appeared to have come from internet service providers seeking usernames and passwords. Majerczyk illegally accessed the accounts of those people who provided that information. Majerczyk pleaded guilty in federal court in Los Angeles last year to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information. He signed a plea agreement for his case to be transferred to Chicago. He was not charged or accused of selling or posting the material online. Both sides agreed he should receive a 9-month prison term. The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Majerczyk's attorney Thomas Needham said in a court filing that his client was \"suffering from depression and looked to pornography websites and internet chat rooms in an attempt to fill some of the voids and disappointment he was feeling in his life.\" Needham said in a sentencing memo that the fallout from the hacking scandal \"deeply affected\" Majerczyk, who has seen a therapist for anxiety and panic attacks. Federal agents have said Lawrence broke down and became distraught during a 2014 meeting about nude photos of her that appeared online. Lawrence called the leak a \"sex crime\" in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine. Pennsylvania man pleads guilty to 'Celebgate' nude-photo hack Majerczyk is the second man arrested in connection with the \"Celebgate\" scandal of 2014. A\u00a0Pennsylvania man, Ryan Collins, 36, pled\u00a0guilty to a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and was sentenced to 18 months in October 2016. The FBI said Collins engaged in a similar \"phishing scheme\" to obtain access to his victims' accounts by sending emails\u00a0that appeared to be from Apple or Google, asking for\u00a0usernames and passwords.\u00a0When the victims complied (FBI Tip #1: Don't ever do this),\u00a0Collins used his illicit access to steal \"personal information including nude photographs and videos\" from his victims' accounts. As with Majerczyk, Collins was not charged with actually sharing or uploading the private photos of female celebrities online. ",

(Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) David Clohessy has resigned as national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, the organization announced on Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2017. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Manya Brachear Pashman Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests announced Tuesday that its longtime national director, accused by a former SNAP employee of referring potential clients to attorneys in return for financial kickbacks to the group, resigned at the end of last year. The announcement that David Clohessy, of St. Louis, left the Chicago-based organization comes a week after he and other leaders were named in a lawsuit filed by a former employee who said she was fired shortly after asking superiors whether SNAP was referring victims to attorneys in exchange for donations to the organization. In addition to Clohessy, defendants named in the lawsuit are the organization itself, Barbara Blaine, its founder and president, and Barbara Dorris, outreach director. Dorris could not be reached for comment. In a statement sent to volunteers Tuesday morning, Mary Ellen Kruger, the chairwoman of the board, thanked Clohessy for his nearly 30 years of service to the organization. \"His passion, his voice and his kindness have touched us all,\" Kruger said. \"We will miss David, and we wish him much happiness. David will always be a friend and an inspiration to SNAP and its many dedicated and hardworking volunteers.\" In an interview Tuesday, Clohessy said he remains on the organization's board of directors for the time being. But his resignation, which he said he told SNAP's board about in October, is the best choice for him and the organization. \"It's healthy for nonprofits to get fresh blood and new perspectives,\" said Clohessy, who said he was stunned by the lawsuit and its allegations.

    "text": "Workers Dismayed by President Trump's Federal Hiring Freeze By matthew barakat, associated press McLEAN, Va. \u0097 Jan 24, 2017, 6:46 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Repeats Unsubstantiated Claim to Congressional Leaders 0 Shares Email Federal worker Greg Guthrie had held out hope after Donald Trump's election to president that his professed advocacy for the American worker would extend to the federal workforce, too. That hope diminished after Trump on Monday issued an executive order implementing a hiring freeze across the federal government, with exceptions only for military, national security or public safety personnel. So while Guthrie wasn't shocked to learn Trump had imposed the hiring freeze, he was disappointed. \"I guess there's a presumption that a lot of people in government are not needed,\" Guthrie, an information specialist with the Department of Commerce's National Technical Information Service in Alexandria, said in a phone interview. \"But we're pretty lean right now, anyway. Now to say that there will be no new, young workers \u2014 that's pretty draconian.\" Trump had raised the possibility of a hiring freeze during the campaign. At a news conference Monday, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the freeze ensures taxpayers get effective and efficient government and said it \"counters the dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years.\" Statistics from the Office of Personnel Management, though, show that the number of executive branch employees hasn't been this low since 1965, and that the number of employees has stayed more or less steady in the last 15 years. Guthrie, who is also union officer with the National Federation of Federal Employees, said he didn't understand how Trump could conclude that a hiring freeze was a good idea even before his Cabinet nominees have been approved. \"As a federal worker, it's kind of deflating to be felt like you're unnecessary,\" he said. The union's president, Randy Erwin, said in a statement Monday that a hiring freeze is a \"terrible idea.\" \"Freezing federal hiring sounds good on the campaign trail, but it does not make government smaller like some people think it does,\" he said. \"All it does is lead to the hiring of more federal contractors which tend to cost taxpayers more than federal employees and are less accountable.\" The full effect of a hiring freeze is unclear. According to OPM, the federal government hired 221,000 workers in fiscal 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. The number excludes uniformed military personnel. But roughly a third of those hired were military veterans, who enjoy hiring preferences in the federal government. Erwin also pointed out that the Department of Veterans Affairs currently has 2,000 vacancies and said \"it is the American veteran that is going to suffer\" because the agency is now barred from filling those vacancies. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia, whose district includes many federal workers, said Monday that the government actually needs to increase its capacity to handle certain issues, like cybersecurity. \"This Executive Order ... will have a depressing effect on our ability to recruit and retain the next generation of federal workers,\" he said. \"This is a far cry from President Kennedy's effort to inspire a new generation to enter public service.\" Republican Barbra Comstock, who also represents parts of northern Virginia in Congress, announced her own opposition to the hiring freeze and said \"past hiring freezes in both Republican and Democrat administrations have cost the federal government money in the long run.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "WATCH President Trump Still Believes Millions Voted Illegally: White House 0 Shares Email After being repeatedly pressed about President Donald Trump 's unsubstantiated claims that \"millions\" of people voted illegally in the presidential election, White House press secretary Sean Spicer left the door open to a possible investigation into the claims during a press briefing Tuesday. On Monday, Trump said during a meeting with congressional leaders in the White House that \"3 to 5 million illegals\" voted, according to two Democratic aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. Spicer told reporters Tuesday \"maybe we will\" launch an investigation into Trump's claims. \"Anything's possible, I think, at some point,\" he added. \"There is no investigation. I said it was possible. Anything is possible. It was a hypothetical question.\" Trump has made repeated claims about voter fraud after losing the popular vote in the election in November, though thus far, no evidence has been presented that backs up his allegations. \"He continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have presented to him,\" Spicer said Tuesday. At least five reporters asked questions on the issue during the press briefing, and at one point Spicer dismissed the suggestion that Trump kept bringing up the topic of the unsubstantiated voter fraud because the president was upset about the vote count. Spicer said Trump \"won very handily\" and \"he's very comfortable with his win.\" When pressed for specific evidence supporting Trump's \"long-standing belief,\" Spicer cited a 2008 study by Pew Research and \"other studies that have been presented to [Trump].\" The Trump transition team was previously asked about this topic and cited the Pew study, which came out in 2012 and focused on the results of the 2008 election and the need to update voter registration rolls. The primary author of the study in question previously responded, tweeting that \"the report made no findings re: voter fraud.\" Spicer did not give names or sources for the other studies. \"We'll see where we go from here, but right now the focus that the president has is putting Americans back to work,\" Spicer said. 0 Shares ",

Launched in November 2016, the new satellite is the first of four new satellites that will transmit images at a higher-resolution than previously possible. The resulting pictures are pretty to look at but that's not the point. These images could save lives. \"High resolution imagery from GOES-16 will provide sharper and more detailed views of hazardous weather systems and reveal features that previous instruments might have missed,\" said Louis W.

Those figures appear to come from two different studies. A 2012 Pew report found millions of invalid voter registrations due to people moving or dying. But the author of that report, David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, tweeted back in late November that this isn't voter fraud. \"We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted,\" he said . On Tuesday, Becker added , \"As I've noted before, voting integrity better in this election than ever before. Zero evidence of fraud.\" The second study was a highly criticized work by Old Dominion University professors who found 14 percent of non-citizens said saying they were registered to vote. The study was based on a sample of a few hundred respondents. During the campaign season, one of the authors said the Trump campaign was exaggerating the study's findings. \"Both sides of the debate on non-citizen voting have exaggerated our findings concerning non-citizen representation,\" political scientist Jesse Richman wrote . \"There are many on the left side of that debate who have relentlessly sought to discredit our results and want to push the level of estimated non-citizen participation to zero. On the right there has been a tendency to misread our results as proof of massive voter fraud, which we don't think they are. Our focus has been on the data, rather than the politics.\" The National Association of Secretaries of State on Tuesday reiterated in a statement the organization's confidence in the lead-up to the 2016 election in the \"systemic integrity of our election process as a bipartisan group.\" \"We are not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by President Trump, but we are open to learning more about the Administration's concerns,\" the statement read. Spicer on Tuesday said Trump is \"very comfortable\" with his win and likely won't call for an investigation despite alleging widespread fraud. However, the issue is clearly a sore spot for the White House. Two sources told NBC News that Trump reportedly spent the first 10 minutes of his bipartisan meeting with congressional leaders at the White House on Monday night repeating relitigating claims that the millions of votes casts by \"illegals\" cost him the popular vote. The claim is unverified and is one that Trump initially made in November after it became clear that he lost the popular vote to Clinton . Clinton's popular vote margin eventually grew to 2.9 million votes. Some clearly frustrated Republican lawmakers begged Trump to stop repeating the fiction. \"To continue to suggest that the 2016 election was conducted in a fashion that millions of people voted illegally undermines faith in our democracy,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham , of South Carolina, told reporters in a hallway of the Dirksen Senate Office Building in D.C. \"It's not coming from a candidate for the office, it's coming from the man who holds the office. So I am begging the president, share with us the information you have about this or please stop saying it.\" President Donald Trump meets with CEO of General Motors Mary Barra, left, CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Sergio Marchionne, right, and other auto industry leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Jan. 24. Shawn Thew / Pool via Getty Images Republicans questioned about Trump's claim were careful not to weigh in on the president's specific comments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would not answer whether he agreed with Trump's claim that millions voted illegally, but said, \"the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true.\" Others such as Senators John Thune, R-South Dakota and Cory Gardner, R-Colorado., both members of leadership also walked a very fine line, refusing to agree with the president but refusing to denounce him either. \"I don't know what that number is. You'll have to get that information for him. But like the leader said, there's always a certain amount of irregularity that goes on in elections - someplace perhaps more so than others. How you quantify that I'm not sure but he must have his methodology,\" Thune said. Trump's remarks were denounced by Democratic elected officials in Washington and nationwide, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, laying into the White House for propagating the inaccurate voter fraud claims. Sanders called the claims \"nonsensical\" and \"delusional.\" \"When Trump talks about 3 to 5 million people voting illegally he is sending a message to every Republican governor in this country to go forward with voter suppression,\" Sanders warned.

President Donald Trump poses with labor leaders Jan. 23, 2017, in the Oval Office at the White House. (Nicholas Kamm / AFP/Getty Images) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The White House on Tuesday stuck firmly to President Donald Trump 's claim that millions of people voted illegally in the November election, but provided no evidence to back up his assertion. Trump spokesman Sean\u00a0Spicer\u00a0said the president \"does believe\" that he lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton only because of widespread illegal ballots. \"He believes what he believes, based on the information he was provided,\"\u00a0Spicer\u00a0said. But he would not detail what information he was referring to, citing only a 2008 study that called for updating voter rolls but did not conclude there has been pervasive election fraud. Spicer, who spent several years at the Republican National Committee before joining the White House, would not say whether he shared the president's belief. He also sidestepped questions about whether the White House would investigate the voter fraud allegations, saying only, \"Anything is possible.\" Trump first raised the prospect of illegal voting during the transition. Then, during a reception with lawmakers at the White House Monday evening, he again claimed that he'd lost the popular vote because 3 million to 5 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally had voted. That's according to a Democratic aide familiar with the exchange who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting. Trump's assertion appears to be part of a continuing pattern for him and his new administration in which falsehoods overshadow his outreach efforts. Both Trump and\u00a0Spicer\u00a0made false comments over the weekend about the crowds who gathered for the inauguration. Technically, the proper way to describe claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election is to state that there's no evidence that it happened. Shortly after the election, we tallied up reports of in-person voter fraud that occurred last year and found a grand total of four examples. There... (Philip Bump) Aides and associates of the president say that he is dogged by insecurity over his loss of the popular vote and believes Democrats and the media are questioning the legitimacy of his presidency. On Tuesday, the president tweeted a photograph from the inauguration taken from an angle that accentuated the crowd and said he planned to hang the image in the press area of the White House. Trump has packed his first days in office with meetings with business leaders and lawmakers. He's also moved to unravel former President Barack Obama 's legacy, including signing orders Tuesday to advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. Both projects had been blocked by the Obama administration. Donald Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without... Days after being sworn in, President Donald Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without... (Abby Phillip, Mike Debonis) Besides taking steps to advance construction of the oil pipelines, subject to renegotiation of the agreements, Trump also signed a notice Tuesday requiring the materials for the pipelines be constructed in the United States, though it was unclear how he planned to enforce the measure. \"From now we are going to start making pipelines in the United States,\" he said. Trump has sought to focus his first full week in office on jobs and the economy. Republicans, as well as some unions, have cited the pipeline projects as prime opportunities for job growth. Obama stopped the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in late 2015, declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was a centerpiece of his environmental legacy. The pipeline would run from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The U.S. government needs to approve the pipeline because it would cross the nation's northern border. Separately, late last year, the Army Corps of Engineers declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe, saying alternative routes needed to be considered. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters say the project threatens drinking water and Native American sites, though Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe. The pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. Even as Trump moves to implement his agenda, he is still making false claims. On Tuesday, Trump summoned the heads of the big three American automakers, General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler, for a breakfast meeting. He pledged to scrap regulations and reduce taxes on corporations that keep jobs in the U.S., though he did not specify his plans for either. His administration, he said, will \"go down as one of the most friendly countries\" for business. The president also said it will announce candidate next week to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the February 2016 death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia. \"We will pick a truly great Supreme Court justice,\" Trump told reporters. \"Probably making my decision this week, we'll be announcing next week.\" Associated Press ",

    "text": "advertisement No one is sure why newly installed White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer hates Dippin' Dots \u2014 the flash-frozen, beaded ice cream snack sold vending machines and at ballparks \u2014 so much, but his feud with the company has been the subject of national headlines this week. Inexplicably, Spicer has spent the past seven years insulting the space-age treat on Twitter. Starting in 2010, the White House press secretary insisted that \"Dippin Dots is NOT the ice cream of the future,\" in contrast to the company's motto. Dippin dots is NOT the ice cream of the future \u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) April 8, 2010 I think I have said this before but Dippin Dots are notthe ice cream of the future \u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 22, 2011 Ice Cream of the Past: Dippin' Dots Files for Bankruptcy http://t.co/xPifdujD \u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) November 4, 2011 If Dippin Dots was truly the ice cream of the future they would not have run out of vanilla cc @Nationals \u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 7, 2015 Now, there's a website that allows ice cream fans to send a package of Dippin' Dots to Spicer with a single click. Senddippindots.com will mail Spicer the frozen treat for 6 dollars, payable with credit card or even Bitcoin \u2014 the cash of the future. Why? As the website states, you should send Dippin' Dots to Spicer \"because he's going to be really annoyed by it.\" Spicer's hatred of the nitrogen-cooled ice cream product has became so notorious that the company responded this week with a peace offering. On Monday, Dippin' Dots tweeted at Spicer and wrote an open letter to the press secretary on its website. @seanspicer , let's connect the dots! We hope you and the @WhiteHouse take us up on our ice cream social invite https://t.co/kmg5cNqpFe \u2014 Dippin' Dots (@DippinDots) January 23, 2017 \"We understand that ice cream is a serious matter,\" reads the Dippin' Dots open letter from January 23. \"And running out of your favorite flavor can feel like a national emergency! We've seen your tweets and would like to be friends rather than foes. After all, we believe in connecting the dots.\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responds to a question from the news media during his first press briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room in the White House in Washington, DC, USA, 23 January 2017. Shawn Thew / EPA The company's open letter to Spicer also asserts that its sales are up and stresses that Dippin' Dots is \"creating jobs and opportunities.\" After Donald Trump's tweets in support of another private company, L.L. Bean, caused a national boycott , Dippin' Dots may be trying to ward off a business backlash by appeasing Spicer. That appeasement appears to have worked: after Dippin' Dots tweeted at Spicer on Monday, the press secretary responded around midnight. After the company invited the White House to \"an ice cream social,\" Spicer suggested , \"How about we do something great for the those who have served out [sic] nation & 1st responders.\" Sorry for the delay How about we do something great for the those who have served out nation & 1st responders https://t.co/G9BPmVAXKS \u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) January 24, 2017 It was unclear as of Tuesday morning if the request would be granted. The Trump campaign press office did not respond to a request for comment. Mary Emily O'Hara ",

Caption The new president met with business leaders the day after swearing in senior members of his White House staff. Jan. 23, 2017\u00a0\u00a0 Elon Musk, left, and Wendell P. Weeks, center, listen to Trump during the meeting. Matt McClain/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Trump has been resentful, even furious, at what he views as the media\u2019s failure to reflect the magnitude of his achievements, and he feels demoralized that the public\u2019s perception of his presidency so far does not necessarily align with his own sense of accomplishment.\u00a0 On Monday, Spicer returned to the lectern, crisply dressed and appearing more comfortable as he parried questions from the press corps. \u201cThere is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support that he has,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd I think that it\u2019s just unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough, it\u2019s not good enough, you can\u2019t win.\u201d [ Sean Spicer at press briefing: \u2018Our intention is never to lie to you\u2019 ] Unlike other senior aides \u2014 Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, counselor Kellyanne Conway and senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law \u2014 Spicer does not enjoy a close and long-standing personal relationship with Trump. During the campaign, Trump was suspicious of both Priebus and Spicer, who ran the Republican National Committee and were seen as more loyal to the party than to its nominee. Some privately wonder whether Conway is now trying to undermine Spicer.\u00a0 As Trump thought about staffing his administration following his surprise victory, he hesitated over selecting Spicer as White House press secretary. He did not see Spicer as particularly telegenic and preferred a woman for the position, asking Conway to do it and also considering conservative commentators Laura Ingraham and Monica Crowley \u2014 who ultimately stepped down from an administration job because of charges of plagiarism \u2014 before settling on Spicer at the urging of Priebus and others. Yet if there was any doubt over the weekend about Spicer\u2019s standing with the president, it seemed to have been erased by his performance Monday, at least for the moment. Trump told his senior team that he was pleased with Spicer\u2019s more confident and relaxed turn at the lectern. \u201cHis very first briefing as White House press secretary was a tour de force,\u201d Conway said. \u201cHe engaged the media, he was respectful and firm, he talked about accountability on a two-way street, he gave facts, he broke news in terms of what the president was doing.\u201d But tensions and internal power struggles have plagued other parts of Trump\u2019s fledgling orbit, too.\u00a0 Efforts to launch an outside group supporting Trump\u2019s agenda have stalled amid fighting between Kushner loyalists, such as the campaign\u2019s data and digital strategist Brad Parscale, and conservative donor Rebekah Mercer, according to people familiar with the tensions. Major disputes include who would control the data the outside group would use, with Mercer advocating for Cambridge Analytica, a firm in which her father is invested, and who would control the lucrative contracts with vendors, these people said. Two people close to the transition also said a number of Trump\u2019s most loyal campaign aides have been alarmed by Kushner\u2019s efforts to elbow aside anyone he perceives as a possible threat to his role as Trump\u2019s chief consigliere. At one point during the transition, Kushner had argued internally against giving Conway a White House role, these two people said. Because Conway operates outside of the official communications department, some aides grumble that she can go rogue when she pleases, offering her own message and promoting herself as much as the president. One suggested that Conway\u2019s office on the second floor of the West Wing, as opposed to one closer to the Oval Office, was a sign of her diminished standing. Though Conway took over the workspace previously occupied by Valerie Jarrett, who had been\u00a0Obama\u2019s closest adviser, the confidant dismissively predicted that Trump would rarely climb a flight of stairs. Yet that assessment may misunderstand the Trump-Conway relationship. The president admires her dogged and fearless defenses of him and respects her on-camera ability to dodge, defuse and deflect whatever comes her way, according to numerous Trump advisers. On the eve of his inauguration, Trump called Conway on stage at a black-tie dinner to sing her praises. Trump watched Sunday as Conway sparred with NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Some Trump allies were unsettled by her performance, but not the president, according to one official. He called Vice President Pence to rave about how she handled questions from Todd, whom Trump mocked on Twitter as \u201cSleepy Eyes,\u201d and called Conway to offer his congratulations. Trump was perturbed that the media focused on two words from Conway\u2019s interview: \u201calternative facts.\u201d [ How Kellyanne Conway ushered in the era of \u2018alternative facts\u2019 ] Conway is arguably Trump\u2019s most recognizable aide, which has caused her to receive threats against her life. She has been assigned a Secret Service detail, according to someone with detailed knowledge of the situation. In perhaps the clearest sign of where the administration\u2019s power center resides, the \u201cBig Four\u201d \u2014 Bannon, Conway, Kushner and Priebus \u2014 stood in the front row at Sunday afternoon\u2019s swearing-in ceremony for senior staffers, in the White House\u2019s East Room.\u00a0 Conway herself said that while the advisers sometimes disagree, rumors of dissension are overblown.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re a cohesive unit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe senior team exhibits many of the characteristics President Trump has always valued: cohesion, collaboration, high energy and high impact.\u201d Some Trump insiders have suggested tension between Conway and Priebus, but she said that could not be further from the truth. \u201cI really respect the job that Reince is doing most of all,\u201d Conway said. \u201cHe has a very good way of choosing battles wisely, which is a hallmark of a real leader and manager.\u201d Conway said she now hopes to limit her television appearances. Instead, she is taking on an expanded portfolio, which will include health care and veterans\u2019 issues, and Pence \u2014 for whom she has worked for years as a pollster \u2014 is also expected to carve out more substantive responsibilities for her.\u00a0 Longtime GOP fundraiser and adviser Fred Malek said that a president benefits from having advisers with distinct perspectives, noting the Ed Meese and Jim Baker debates in the Reagan White House.\u00a0 \u201cYou want to have a robust discussion and you want to have competing points of view debated with vigor,\u201d Malek said. \u201cTo the extent that results in bruised feelings sometimes, so be it.\u201d\u00a0 Read more: ",

Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz , USA TODAY Sports Published 12:36 p.m. ET Jan. 4, 2017 | Updated 7 hours ago CLOSE x Share USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero breaks down the wins by the Falcons and Patriots and looks ahead to their matchup in Super Bowl LI. USA TODAY Sports Rebuild rankings for 2017. 612 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE With the NFL's conference championship games over, it's time to look ahead to next year for the 30\u00a0eliminated teams. Several organizations are poised for a rise in 2017, with the returning talent to make a playoff push. For several others, rebuilding could be a multi-year project. Here's our look at all of the eliminated teams (ahead of Super Bowl LI) ranked by potential success for next season: 1. Steelers Pittsburgh's parts began to coalesce down the stretch, and a nine-game winning streak showed\u00a0what a threat this team could be at its best. An AFC Championship Game exit leaves the Steelers wondering what if, but that remains a promising hypothetical for the future. Le'Veon Bell is set to become a free agent, and the Steelers revealed themselves to be dependent upon his patient running style. Martavis Bryant's return should bolster the passing game, but additional threats must be found to ease the burden on Antonio Brown. The young defense still has room to grow, but Bud Dupree and Artie Burns could take a significant step next season for a unit on the upswing. 2. Packers In Green Bay's season-ending unraveling in the NFC Championship Game, the same flaws that were readily apparent through much of the season reappeared. An undermanned defense proved unable to keep up with a potent passing attack, and Aaron Rodgers couldn't cover for the offense's lack of playmakers. But this might have been a drastically different team if not for a calamitous run of injuries at the skill positions, even if a reboot is required there. Rodgers, however, is what separates Green Bay from the field. The quarterback showed he can breathe life into any team, though relying on this tactic isn't a sound strategy moving ahead. 3. Cowboys It's hard to find the silver lining in a 13-3 season that ended in the divisional round, but Dallas is well-situated for the foreseeable future. With Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott and three all-pros up front, the offense could be overpowering for years to come. Making a call on Tony Romo remains the biggest offseason story, but a secondary shake-up could be ahead with cornerbacks Brandon Carr and Morris Claiborne as well as safeties Barry Church and J.J. Wilcox set to become free agents. With Randy Gregory suspended again, the pass rush also needs refurbishing. 4. Raiders Oakland had a historic bit of bad luck when Derek Carr broke his leg on Christmas Eve. Previously, no quarterback with 12 or more regular-season wins had failed to start in the postseason. Still, if Carr's recovery goes smoothly, this team has the makings of a contender next season. Led by Khalil Mack, the 26th-ranked defense has the talent to take a significant step forward. Running back Latavius Murray is set to hit the market, but Carr and the dominant offensive line should keep the team in fine shape. 5. Seahawks A lack of investment along the offensive line served as Seattle's undoing, and now Pete Carroll and Co. must take a realistic look at the future of this perennial contender. But with a young core \u2014 defensive end Michael Bennett is the only notable starter over 30 \u2014 don't expect the Seahawks to take a step back. If Earl Thomas recovers from a broken leg and Russell Wilson gets some help, Seattle should remain toward the top of the NFC pecking order. 6. Chiefs Does Kansas City need a shakeup to reach the next level? Winning the AFC West and 10 of their final 12 games made for impressive accomplishments, but the team needs more than do-everything threat to break an Alex Smith-led offense out of its methodical tendencies. There's impressive young talent with Travis Kelce and Dee Ford in the fold. But keeping both safety Eric Berry and defensive tackle Dontari Poe could prove difficult, and a tough call has to be made on whether running back Jamaal Charles returns. 7. Giants A $200 million\u00a0offseason overhaul of the defense paid off for Big Blue, as key free agent additions helped transform the unit from dormant to dominant. But Ben McAdoo's offense was a letdown, failing to score 20 points in its last six games and offsetting gains elsewhere with its stagnation. Another threat must be found outside of Odell Beckham Jr., and Victor Cruz could be headed out unless he takes a substantial pay cut. Change also could be looming along\u00a0the line, as defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul and defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins are headed for\u00a0free agency. 8. Titans Tennessee has swum against the current of larger NFL trends with its run-heavy attack, but it found sustainable success and now sits on the precipice of a breakout. Despite suffering a broken fibula in Week 16, Marcus Mariota has given every indication he's a franchise quarterback. A dominant offensive line can help the Titans emulate the Cowboys and Raiders in their rapid rises. And in a wide-open AFC South, there's plenty of room for growth this offseason for a team with two first-round draft picks and significant salary cap space. 9. Broncos Despite a disappointing defense of its Super Bowl 50 title, Denver may be in\u00a0position to transition smoothly under new coach Vance Joseph. With a loaded defense and established culture under John Elway, the Broncos can turn their attention to jumpstarting the stalled offense. Having Mike McCoy back as offensive coordinator should\u00a0aid Joseph in his first year.\u00a0Developing quarterbacks Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch \u2014 or finding a veteran to step in \u2014 will be a key concern, and so will restarting a run game that finished 27th in yards per game. 10. Dolphins Adam Gase had Miami ahead of schedule in his first year as head coach, leading the team to its first playoff berth since 2008 despite several glaring deficiencies. Upgrades are needed at linebacker after the 29th-ranked defense was repeatedly overwhelmed, but the return of Pro Bowl safety Reshad Jones should assist an injury-stricken secondary that struggled down the stretch. Ryan Tannehill's development looks to be back on track despite his late-season knee sprain, and the emergence of running back Jay Ajayi bodes well for a promising offense. 11. Buccaneers Jameis Winston's development positions Tampa Bay as a substantial threat for the foreseeable future. Mike Evans established himself as one of the league's premiere receivers, though another threat would help him shed his undue burden in the passing game. The defense might not be able to replicate the late-season takeaway spree that keyed its surge, but the young group could continue its rise, especially if Mike Smith remains defensive coordinator. The Buccaneers should have the cap room to make a splash in free agency, but their recent history in high-priced acquisitions has been dodgy. 12. Redskins Washington narrowly missed out on its chance to secure its first consecutive postseason berths since 1992. Assuming Kirk Cousins returns, be it on a long-term deal or franchise tag again, another playoff push seems likely. Balance might be needed, however, given that the heavy investment on offense has left the defense\u00a0thin. Changes in the receiving corps could be coming, too, with DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon set to become free agents. 2017 NFL draft first-round order 13. Texans One year after addressing its longstanding quarterback problems by signing Brock Osweiler, Houston's problems at the position seem more significant than ever. Osweiler is a near lock to return, though coach Bill O'Brien would not commit to him as the starter. A top-ranked defense will become even more imposing upon J.J. Watt's return, and no other team has staked its claim to the AFC South. But Houston is stuck in neutral until there's a serious shift behind center. 14. Ravens Baltimore was a mere minute from positioning itself for the AFC North despite its usual maladies: inconsistency from Joe Flacco, who finished 24th in passer rating, and a reliance on late-career veterans. There's no promising those issues will be remedied, especially given Steve Smith Sr.'s retirement and the struggles to generate a pass rush beyond Terrell Suggs. But mining more young talent, like\u00a0cornerback Tavon Young, at key positions could give this team a needed jolt. 15. Panthers\u00a0 Which Cam Newton can Carolina expect next season: the 2015 MVP or this year's version, who produced career lows in completion percentage (52.9) and total yards (3,868)? The answer may be somewhere in between the two, but something closer to the former should return the Panthers to contention. Ignoring the offensive line for another season could prove perilous, and the pass rush needs to be rejuvenated. But Newton, Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis are not to be overlooked. 2017 NFL home, away opponents for every team 16. Vikings Injuries to Teddy Bridgewater, Adrian Peterson and both starting offensive tackles helped unravel Minnesota after its 5-0 start, giving the team a wait-til-next-year veneer. The offensive issues might not be repaired by time alone, however, as the line left Sam Bradford vulnerable and the running game languished as the NFL's worst. Decisions must be made on a quarterback plan as well as Peterson's future. But Mike Zimmer could work wonders with a do-over and another go with his defense. 17. Lions It's difficult to have much faith in a team that won eight games on fourth-quarter comebacks replicating that same success. Detroit went 0-6 against playoff teams this season, and even coach Jim Caldwell conceded that the team is \"a ways away\" from a Super Bowl title. Still without a playoff win since 1991, Detroit doesn't appear to have a clear path forward. Matthew Stafford's progress was encouraging, but the quarterback could be poised to become the NFL's highest-paid player this offseason. 18. Colts So long as Andrew Luck remains healthy, Indianapolis will be a threat. The Colts, however, may have missed their best shot at compiling a proper supporting cast for Luck before making him the highest-paid player in football. The offensive line has yet to find its footing, and the defense requires an infusion of young talent. Still, in the AFC South, Luck makes Indianapolis a perennial contender. 19. Cardinals After stumbling in its follow-up to last season's NFC Championship Game trip, Arizona enters the offseason in a somewhat precarious position. But as long as Carson Palmer and Larry Fitzgerald opt to put off retirement, Bruce Arians could have the makings for a strong group next season. David Johnson is perhaps the NFL's best young all-purpose threat, and both the offense and defense finished in the top 10. Free agency could provide some trouble, as outside linebacker Chandler Jones, defensive end Calais Campbell and safety Tony Jefferson all are set to hit the market. 20. Chargers San Diego could make a strong case as the NFL's unluckiest team in 2016. The Chargers finished with 20 players on injured reserve and went 1-8 in games decided by seven points or less. Now it's up to new coach Anthony Lynn to find a way to finish with\u00a0Philip Rivers and Co. Having its Los Angeles saga finally resolved\u00a0could rid the team of one of its distractions, but there's a wide gap\u00a0between this team and the rest of the playoff-ready AFC West. 21. Eagles Despite falling flat after a hot start, Philadelphia has reason to be encouraged about the franchise's direction after its first year under Doug Pederson. How Carson Wentz develops after hitting a rookie wall could determine the course of the season. Major upgrades are needed at the skill positions after the wide receivers continually disappointed and cornerbacks were exposed. Catching up to the rest of the NFC East won't be easy. 22. Jaguars Jacksonville didn't make the jump many expected in 2016, but there's more potential here for new coach Doug Marrone than the 3-13 record indicates. If Blake Bortles' career can be salvaged after this year's regression, a turnaround could be on the horizon. A breakout defense features several young standouts in cornerback Jalen Ramsey, linebacker Telvin Smith and defensive tackle Malik Jackson. NFL coaching buzz: Latest on job openings, candidates 23. Saints After its third straight 7-9 season, New Orleans seems to be stuck in place with its top-ranked offense and languishing defense. Drew Brees is still thriving, but the team has done little to look to a future beyond him. Further progress is required on defense, though having cornerbacks Delvin Breaux and P.J. Williams healthy should provide a boost. 24. Bengals Cincinnati's five-year streak of postseason appearances is over, and it's difficult to see a path toward an immediate return. Continued problems along the offensive line could further inhibit Andy Dalton after he took a step back this season. A.J. Green needs assistance in the passing game, and Adam Jones' arrest could alter the offseason plans for the defense. 25. Bills Buffalo has the returning talent to be ranked much higher, but the franchise's uncertainties run deep with Sean McDermott taking over for the fired Rex Ryan. The organization has to redefine itself after two seasons marked by inconsistency. A decision looms on Tyrod Taylor's extension after an awkward Week 17 benching. LeSean McCoy and the top-ranked rushing offense could ease the transition, but a disappointing defense might need to be reshuffled. 26. Rams Sean McVay might have been attracted to Los Angeles' coaching vacancy\u00a0for reasons beyond the roster, but there's substantial work to be done. A horrid offensive line still stands as a threat to the development of both top pick Jared Goff and running back Todd Gurley. A fearsome front led by defensive tackle Aaron Donald couldn't hide the defense's deficiencies, especially depth in the secondary. With no first-round pick after the trade to move up for Goff, McVay will need to push the right buttons to break the team out of its stagnation. 27. Bears An unremarkable season may be best known for the potential end of Jay Cutler's run in Chicago. Matt Barkley fared well as a fill-in, but it's time for general manager Ryan Pace to make a serious investment in a young quarterback. But there's young talent emerging, including running back Jordan Howard, wide receiver Cameron Meredith and outside linebacker Leonard Floyd. 28. Jets\u00a0 The picture isn't very rosy for Gang Green. Todd Bowles is back, but new leaders must be found after a season of infighting. Starting fresh could mean parting with the likes of defensive end Sheldon Richardson, wide receiver Brandon Marshall or cornerback Darrelle Revis, among others. Neither Bryce Petty nor Christian Hackenberg appear to be viable options to take over at quarterback, but even a veteran quarterback likely won't save this team in 2017. 29. 49ers After firing Chip Kelly and Trent Baalke in yet another reset, San Francisco appears to be aimless. The last-ranked defense is in disarray. Yet the 49ers may be lured into investing in a young quarterback, especially if Colin Kaepernick departs. With a multi-year rebuild ahead, owner Jed York needs to find the right general manager and coach pairing to establish the proper culture. 30. Browns Cleveland's 1-15 season was all the more disappointing for the lack of resolution it provided the franchise moving forward. No answer\u00a0at quarterback emerged, and counting on either Robert Griffin III or Cody Kessler next season would be a substantial gamble. Linebacker Jamie Collins re-upped, but with wide receiver Terrelle Pryor set to become free agents, the Browns have to find a way to hang onto the few promising players on the roster. Still, Hue Jackson can find room to grow in Year 2 with a stockpile of picks, including the No. 1 overall.

Nasser Nasser/AP hide caption toggle caption Nasser Nasser/AP Tuesday's announcement includes plans for new construction in the Israeli settlement of Beit El, near the West Bank city of Ramallah. Nasser Nasser/AP Israel says it plans to build 2,500 more homes for Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. This is the second such announcement this week, after Israel approved permits for 560 units in East Jerusalem . President Trump, who took office on Friday, is widely expected to be more supportive of settlement expansion than his predecessor. Settlements are widely viewed as an obstacle to peace by the Palestinians and the international community, and Palestinian officials have responded angrily to today's announcement. \"We are building \u2014 and will continue to build,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on Facebook . Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new houses are \"in response to housing needs,\" according to The Associated Press. \"Most of the units are located within settlement blocs, while some 100 of them are located in the settlement of Beit El, and others in Migron,\" the Israeli newspaper Haaretz writes . \"However, a look at the planned locations shows the construction is slated for outside the settlement blocs, as well.\" The Obama administration had been sharply critical of settlement expansion. That culminated last month in a rare U.S. abstention from a U.N. Security Council vote condemning settlements built on land annexed by Israel in 1967; the U.S. has typically vetoed resolutions that are critical of Israel. Article continues after sponsorship 7 Things To Know About Israeli Settlements But there is reason to think the Trump administration will take a different approach. Trump slammed the U.S. abstention on Twitter , saying that \"we cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.\" As the AP reports, Beit El, which is set to see additional homes because of today's announcement, \"has received donations from Trump's designated ambassador to Israel and from the family of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser.\" Nabil Abu Rdeneh, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the move \"a challenge and provocation and disregard for the Arab world and the international community [that] requires a real and serious position from the entire world,\" the wire service reported. NPR's Parallels blog recently explained how settlements have rapidly expanded in the past two decades: \"When the Israelis and Palestinians first began peace talks after a 1993 interim agreement, the West Bank settlers numbered a little over 100,000. Today they total around 400,000 and live in about 130 separate settlements. ... \"They have grown under every Israeli government over the past half-century despite consistent international opposition. Hard-line leaders like Netanyahu have actively supported them. Moderates and liberals have also allowed settlements to expand, though usually at a slower rate. The settler movement is a powerful political force, and any prime minister who takes it on risks the collapse of his government.\" Another big issue is whether Trump will carry out his campaign pledge to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the contested city of Jerusalem, changing decades of U.S. policy. \"The U.S. position has long been that the legal status of Jerusalem is yet to be determined,\" NPR's Mark Katkov explained . \"A law passed by Congress in 1995 requires the U.S. to move its embassy to Jerusalem but allows presidents to waive that requirement, which all have done.\" The provocative idea, applauded by some Israelis, is strongly opposed by Palestinians and could cause unrest across the region.

    "text": "2017-01-23T18:34:03-05:00 January 23, 2017 6:34 PM ET The debut issue of The New York Times on Sept. 18, 1851, known then as The New-York Daily Times , contained one wedding announcement , and one wedding announcement only, for the newlyweds Sarah Mullett and John Grant. He was 26 and she was 23. The ceremony took place at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Fredonia, the town in western New York where the bride had grown up. The bridegroom was from Jamestown. They were married Sept. 10, by the Rev. T. P. Tyler. The announcement was a mere sentence, a bare-bones beginning for a Times institution. Photo So why were John and Sarah the chosen ones? Based on old newspaper clippings and census reports, it appears that the Mulletts were a prominent family in Fredonia. The bride\u2019s father, James, epitomized upward mobility. He grew up on a farm in Vermont, the oldest of 13 children, and made his way to Fredonia, where he became a self-taught lawyer (such a thing was possible in those days). He eventually became a State Supreme Court justice. The bridegroom was a cousin of Ulysses S. Grant, then an Army lieutenant, who would go on to become a general and president. Today, oil portraits of John and Sarah hang side by side in the New Haven family room of Wendy Grant Haskell, 63, who is a psychotherapist and the Grants\u2019 great-great-granddaughter. Each is wearing black, and a similarly dour and humorless expression, as if they had whispered to each other beforehand, \u201cDon\u2019t smile!\u201d \u201cI think they are trying to project importance, status and prestige,\u201d Ms. Haskell said, adding that the portraits were probably painted soon after the wedding. (When I first called Ms. Haskell to inquire about John and Sarah Grant, she was flummoxed; I think she thought I was trying to sell her a Times subscription. When I explained my reason for calling, she said she had no idea the Grants had appeared in the newspaper\u2019s first wedding announcement. \u201cWhat a hoot!\u201d) See the announcement in the first issue of The New-York Daily Times. Her brother David Marshall Grant, an actor you might recognize from \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\" or his Tony-nominated performance as Joe Pitt in \u201cAngels in America,\u201d said: \u201cI would guess, looking at those portraits, that it was a less joyful time. I\u2019m sure there were struggles just to get by. I can\u2019t imagine what it was like just to make breakfast. I\u2019m angry when there\u2019s a line at Starbucks.\u201d John and Sarah Grant\u2019s lives probably did not turn out exactly as they envisioned. After the wedding, they settled in Jamestown, where John was co-owner of a grocery store dealing in tea, fruit, molasses and salt, among other products. Sarah kept house, according to the census, and had a live-in Irish servant. The couple had one son, James Mullett Grant, who married and also had one son, Havens Grant. Then, sometime before the turn of the century, James Mullett Grant traveled alone to Havana and never returned. \u201cJohn and Sarah Grant were all about the promise of being a really significant couple starting a whole line of prosperity, but then look at what happened,\u201d Ms. Haskell said. \u201cTheir son fell off the edge of the earth.\u201d On June 2, 1883, John Grant\u2019s obituary appeared in The Evening Observer, a local newspaper. As brief and terse as his wedding announcement, the notice merely reported that he had \u201cdropped dead\u201d in his home at age 60. Sarah Grant died 29 years later. Then things got even more interesting. The couple\u2019s grandson, Havens Grant, went to Yale, became a lawyer in New York City, married a free-spirited poet and ran a moonshine business on the side during Prohibition. Today, the Grant descendants gather every Christmas at Ms. Haskell\u2019s home in Connecticut and take a family photo with John and Sarah\u2019s portraits in the background. In a recent photograph, everyone is wearing colorful tie-dyed scarves or shirts. David Marshall Grant appears with his husband, KC Reischerl, and their daughter, Evelyn May Reischerl Grant, who is 6 and the youngest descendant. She is also the only female family member in the photo. Ms. Haskell\u2019s three sons are gay and appear with their partners. Photo Sarah and John Grant\u2019s descendants and their partners in 2014.

He is a co-owner of Kings County Distillery , which is based in Brooklyn Navy Yard and makes craft whiskeys. What would John and Sarah Grant think? If they were to see the lineup of gay couples in tie-dye, David Marshall Grant said, \u201cI think they would think they had gone to Mars; it\u2019s an astonishing example of what happens in time.\u201d Lois Smith Brady wrote the Vows column from its inception in 1992 to 2001, when she moved to Aspen, Colo.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed Tuesday that the VA is covered under the freeze , which exempted the military and other positions deemed necessary for national security and public safety. He said the administration wanted to make sure Trump\u2019s pick to lead the VA, current Undersecretary for Health at the agency David Shulkin, is confirmed. \u201cRight now, the system\u2019s broken,\u201d Spicer said, adding that the freeze is meant only to \u201cpause\u201d hiring until further analysis can be done and a plan put in place to fix things. \u201cWhen you have a system that\u2019s not working,\u00a0and then going out and hiring additional people doesn\u2019t seem to be the most efficient way of solving the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need to do, whether it\u2019s the VA or any other agency, is make sure that we\u2019re hiring smartly and effectively and\u00a0 efficiently. \"And I think the VA in particular, if you look at the problems that have plagued people, hiring more people isn\u2019t the answer, it's hiring the right people, putting the procedures in place that ensure that our veterans \u2014\u00a0whether health care or mortgages or the other services that VA provides to those who have served our nation \u2014\u00a0get the services that they\u2019ve earned.\u201d The order Trump signed does not cover hires already in the works before Monday. But the VA is currently advertising to fill more than 2,000 job openings on the federal hiring website, including for hundreds of nurses and doctors. Shulkin has told USA TODAY that one of his top priorities is getting fully staffed up. After Spicer's remarks, the VA said it planned to take advantage of the hiring freeze's allowances for public safety needs. \"The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to exempt anyone it deems necessary for public safety, including frontline caregivers,\" Acting VA Secretary Robert Snyder said in a statement. USA TODAY has reported on the massive bureaucracy between top-line leaders like Shulkin and front-line care providers that has\u00a0slowed some improvements in the VA since the scandal broke in 2014 with revelations that schedulers in Phoenix had kept secret wait lists masking how long veterans had been waiting for appointments and at least 40 died while waiting. The VA is one of the largest agencies in the federal government with more than 350,000 employees. The agency provides veterans with death, disability and education benefits, as well as health care at more 1,200 medical facilities that serve nearly 9 million veterans each year. A liberal veterans group that slammed Trump during the campaign seized on the hiring freeze. In a statement earlier\u00a0Tuesday, VoteVets senior adviser\u00a0Peter Kauffmann said that if it applied to the VA, it would be the \"ultimate insult to our men and women who serve to deny them the additional doctors, nurses, therapists, and administrators that are sorely needed at the VA.\u201d \u201cIf his (order) leads to preventable deaths, that will be on Donald Trump\u2019s hands, and we will hold him personally accountable,\u201d Kauffmann said.

Trump often touted the need to repair the country's infrastructure on the campaign trail and has continued to since the election, mentioning it in his inaugural address last week when he pledged to \"build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.\" Play Trump Signs Executive Orders on Keystone, Dakota Access Pipelines 3:07 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170125014312if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/861598275934\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Democrats have released their plan ahead of a Trump proposal in order to pressure him to stick to his campaign promises. It's also an attempt to drive a wedge between Trump and Republicans who are ideologically skeptical of a large infrastructure spending measures. Republicans successfully defeated a major infrastructure bill during the first term of former President Barack Obama's administration and have not enthusiastically embraced Trump's focus on it yet. \"We're challenging him here today,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said during a news conference. \"Now that we've been stymied by our Republican colleagues \u2026 now we have a president elect (sic) who has called for a large infrastructure bill.\" Trump has said infrastructure is one of his top priorities, even laying out a broad proposal during his transition. But with any major spending bill on Congress, the way it is paid for or financed often exposes deep divisions. Schumer wouldn't say how he would pay for it but suggested that one idea is to close tax loopholes or rely on the generation of revenue through job creation. He dismissed any proposal to cut domestic spending as well as Trump's plan that relies on financing through tax incentives and public-private partnerships. \"We don't want all the benefits going to developers and wealthy people,\" Schumer said. \"How we will pay for it we will discuss with President Trump.\" The Democrats' plan is wide-ranging, including $210 billion for roads and bridges, $180 billion for rail and bus programs and $110 billion for sewer and water. Another $10 billion would go for VA refurbishing and $75 billion for school infrastructure. Play ",

Got it The headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) By Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis By Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis January 24 at 6:44 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @brady_dennis Trump administration officials instructed employees at multiple agencies in recent days to cease communicating with the public through news releases, official social media accounts and correspondence, raising concerns that federal employees will be able to convey only information that supports the new president\u2019s agenda. The new limits on public communications appear to be targeting agencies that are charged with overseeing environmental and scientific policy, prompting criticism from officials within the agencies and from outside groups focused on climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency as well as the Agriculture and Interior departments now have formal policies restricting what they should convey to the public about their work. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he and his colleague were \u201clooking into\u201d whether the administration had changed the way many agencies share information publicly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that when there\u2019s an administration turnover that we\u2019re going to review the policies,\u201d Spicer said, \u201cbut with respect to the question you\u2019re asking, I don\u2019t have information at this time.\u201d Many new administrations \u2014 including former president Barack Obama\u2019s \u2014 have moved quickly to take control of the U.S. government\u2019s public relations machinery and centralize decision-making upon taking office. But the sweeping nature of some of the new controls is unusual, and the fact that they come as departments have been communicating through an array of digital platforms has made the changes particularly visible. The moves also underscore the kind of skirmishing that could continue to take place between incoming political appointees and civil service employees. At the EPA, for example, communications staff received a memo instructing them that \u201cno social media will be going out\u201d and \u201ca digital strategist will be coming on board\u201d to oversee it. It added, \u201cIncoming media requests will carefully screened.\u201d According to a former agency official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, members of Trump\u2019s EPA landing team spent significant time asking about who controlled the department\u2019s communications levers, especially regarding social media. EPA\u2019s numerous social media accounts appear to have fallen silent since Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the lone exception of the agency\u2019s Office of Water, which sent out a handful of tweets over the weekend, including a link to what local communities are doing to protect their waterways and advice on using an app to help people figure out whether their local waterway is polluted. [ Trump officials instruct EPA to halt all grants, contracts ] \u201cThe EPA fully intends to continue to provide information to the public,\u201d the agency said in a statement Tuesday, in response to questions about the media blackout. \u201cA fresh look at public affairs and communications processes is common practice for any new Administration, and a short pause in activities allows for this assessment.\u201d Environmental Working Group President Ken Cook said in a statement that the new restrictions were significant cause for concern. \u201cVladimir Putin must be proud,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThe EPA, like all federal agencies, is funded by taxpayer dollars, and Americans have the right to know what\u2019s being done to protect or harm public health and the environment. Americans of all political stripes should be furious.\u201d Separately, the Interior Department reactivated its official Twitter accounts early Saturday after an abrupt shutdown after the National Park Service account retweeted two items viewed as unsympathetic to the new president. One referred to the size of the inauguration crowd on the Mall, while another addressed policies that were excised from the White House website after Trump\u2019s swearing in. Speaking to reporters about the Park Service incident, Spicer said, \u201cMy understanding is that because they inappropriately violated their own social media policies there was guidance that was put out to the department to act in compliance with the rules that were set forth.\u201d Some issues appear to be off limits for park system officials now that Trump is in office. Badlands National Park tweeted several times about the rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the implications of climate change, noting at one point, \u201cBurning one gallon of gasoline puts 20lbs of carbon into our atmosphere #climate.\u201d But by early Tuesday evening, those tweets were deleted. The EPA appears to be the focus of concerted attention from the new administration: Officials there have also halted the granting of any new contracts or awards by the department. But the agency is not alone. At the Agriculture Department, a slew of officials \u2014 including deputy under- and assistant secretaries, agency heads, and individuals serving in acting capacities in those posts \u2014 received a memo Monday instructing them to clear any media communications with the secretary\u2019s office. \u201cIn order for the Department to deliver unified, consistent messages, it\u2019s important for the Office of the Secretary to be consulted on media inquiries and proposed responses to questions related to legislation, budgets, policy issues, and regulations,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cPolicy-related statements should not be made to the press without notifying and consulting the Office of the Secretary. This includes press releases and on and off the record conversations.\u201d Employees of the agency\u2019s scientific arm, the Agriculture Research Service, were ordered in a separate memo to cease publication of \u201coutward facing\u201d documents and news releases. The ARS guidance was not issued in coordination with other offices at the USDA, department officials said, and partially contradicted the department-wide memo that went out on the same day. \u201cStarting immediately and until further notice, [the Agricultural Research Service] will not release any public-facing documents. This includes, but is not limited to, news releases, photos, fact sheets, news feeds, and social media content,\u201d wrote ARS chief Sharon Drumm in an email to employees. USDA Acting Deputy Administrator Michael Young, in a phone call with reporters Tuesday evening, said he had discussed the issue with ARS and indicated he would be open to clarifying or rescinding the research agency\u2019s confusing guidance. \u201cThe ARS guidance was not reviewed by me. I would not have put that kind of guidance out. My guidance has to do with policy-related announcement and that sort of thing,\u201d Young said. \u201cI had my memo drafted before the ARS memo, I was not a part of it.\u201d Department officials scrambled to clarify the memo Tuesday afternoon, after intense public scrutiny and media requests, stating that ARS had not \u201cblacked out public information\u201d and adding that scientific articles published through professional peer-reviewed journals have not been banned. Such a decree would have conflicted with established scientific integrity standards and previous media guidance \u201cencouraging, but not requiring, USDA scientists to communicate with the media about their scientific findings.\u201d \u201cAs the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s chief scientific in-house research agency, ARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public as we strive to find solutions to agricultural problems affecting America,\u201d ARS said in a statement to The Washington Post Tuesday afternoon, seeking to clarify the scope of the memo. Under President George W. Bush, several agencies restricted journalists\u2019 access to researchers working on climate change and other issues. President Obama instructed agencies to develop a \u201cscientific integrity\u201d policy aimed at clarifying how federal employees could disseminate such information without fear of retribution. Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, noted that both EPA and USDA have scientific integrity policies that \u201camong other things, protect scientists\u2019 right to speak out about their work. The American people deserve to know the results of taxpayer-funded research.\u201d Separately, Interior chiefs of staff, bureaus and offices received a memo from Julie Little, director of the Office of Executive Secretariat and Regulatory Affairs, instructing them to clear all correspondence to or from the Secretary with her office at least five days \u201cprior to any deadline for Departmental clearance.\u201d The memo also instructed officials to forward any correspondence from lawmakers, state and tribal officials and \u201cnational level environmental/recreational and industry officials\u201d with Little\u2019s office \u201cprior to responding, regarding of addressee or signature level.\u201d Officials at several agencies \u2014 including the Justice and Labor departments, NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey \u2014 said they were continuing to communicate as they had before Trump occupied the Oval Office. In some cases, reporters described media blackouts at agencies that had not transpired. The National Institutes of Health issued an email to its Institute and Center directors informing them they should not communicate on public forums and with public officials on new or pending regulation, policy or guidance that is under review. The guidance referred to the rules that are now in limbo, given the fact that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus issued a regulatory freeze Friday on any regulations that had not yet been published in the Federal Register. \u201cContrary to erroneous media reports, HHS and its agencies continue to communicate fully about its work through all of its regular communication channels with the public, the media and other relevant audiences,\u201d said a Health and Human Services official in an email. \u201cThere is no directive to do otherwise.\u201d Jose DelReal, Lenny Bernstein, Sarah Kaplan and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "CBS News Jan 24, 2017 10:32 AM EST CBS News\u2019 Pat Milton confirms that President Trump has asked James Comey to remain in his job as FBI director. Comey has a ten-year term that extends for another six years, so in essence, Mr. Trump has just decided not to fire Comey at this point. Comey was appointed FBI director in 2013 by Obama. But, Mr. Trump will likely have to revisit Comey\u2019s job status in about a year. The Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General\u2019s (IG) is currently working on a review of how the FBI and the rest of the Justice Department handled its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server .\u00a0 Inspector General Michael Horowitz says his team will review the actions leading up to Comey\u2019s decision to send letters to Congress on Oct. 28 and Nov. 6 alerting Congress and the public to new emails that were found in the investigation . Shortly before Election Day, the FBI had discovered Clinton-related emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the scandal-ridden former congressman who had been married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, which became public when Comey notified Congress of the discovery. Clinton and many Democrats believe that this was a factor in her loss of the election to Mr. Trump. The IG says that he will look at whether certain underlying decision were based on \u201cimproper considerations.\u201d Also under review -- whether certain officials should have been recused from the investigation and whether the Department and FBI improperly disclosed non-public information.\u00a0 The report is expected to be embarrassing for the FBI, since it will review many of its most controversial decisions in its one of its most controversial cases. It will provide Mr. Trump another opportunity to consider replacing the FBI Director, armed with a detailed watchdog report. Mr. Trump treated Comey warmly when he saw him Sunday at a White House event.\u00a0 He singled Comey and the head of the U.S. Secret Service, Director Joe Clancy out for praise. He summoned both up for handshakes and pats on the back. Trump said of Comey, \u201cHe\u2019s become more famous than me.\u201d\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Mark Knoller contributed to this report. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Senate Democrats Propose $1 Trillion Infrastructure Plan By joan lowy, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 24, 2017, 4:21 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Promises to Rebuild the Nation's Infrastructure 0 Shares Email Senate Democrats on Tuesday offered a plan to spend $1 trillion on transportation and other infrastructure projects over 10 years, challenging President Donald Trump to join them on an issue where they hope to find common ground. Democrats estimate their plan would create 15 million jobs. The plan includes $210 billion to repair aging roads and bridges and another $200 billion for a \"vital infrastructure fund\" to pay for a variety of transportation projects of national significance. An example of the types of projects that could be eligible for financing from the fund is the Gateway Program to repair and replace rail lines and tunnels between New York and New Jersey , some of which are over 100 years old and were damaged in Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The project, which would double the number of trains per hour using the tunnels and help enable high-speed Amtrak service, is estimated to cost about $20 billion. Republican leaders are unlikely to embrace the Democratic plan. It's not clear where Democrats would get the money for their proposal. Infrastructure was raised at a meeting Monday between Trump and lawmakers from both parties. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., said Democrats pitched their plan to Trump and asked for his support. Schumer said he also warned Trump that doing so would mean he'd have to \"go against\" elements of the Republican Party. Trump acknowledged that and seemed open to working with Democrats, he said. A White House spokesman didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters he doesn't want another infrastructure plan that is effectively an economic stimulus program like the one Congress passed in 2009 at former President Barack Obama's behest. He said Republicans are waiting to see what the Trump administration proposes and he hopes it is paid for in \"a credible way.\" Democrats \"thought that was an area maybe to find common ground, and then Sen. McConnell made the important point it needs to be paid for because we've got $20 trillion in debt,\" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican leader, who was at the meeting. Trump bemoaned the state of America's roads, bridges, airports and railways during the presidential campaign and promised to generate $1 trillion in infrastructure investment, putting people to work in the process. But Trump has offered few specifics. Administration officials have indicated they expect Trump to offer details this spring. \"Senate Democrats are walking the walk on repairing and rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure,\" Schumer said. \"We ask President Trump to support this common sense, comprehensive approach.\" Besides transportation, the plan includes money for expanding broadband access in rural areas, water treatment and sewer construction, veterans' hospitals and schools. A proposal by two of Trump's financial advisers circulated just after the election calls for using $137 billion in tax credits to generate $1 trillion in private investment in infrastructure projects over 10 years. But investors are typically interested only in projects that have a revenue stream like tolls to produce a profit. Elaine Chao, Trump's nominee for transportation secretary, told senators last week that she wants to \"unleash the potential\" of private investors to boost transportation. Charging tolls for roads and bridges is often unpopular. A recent Washington Post poll found that 66 percent of the public opposes granting tax credits to investors who put their money into transportation projects in exchange for the right to charge tolls. Transportation industry lobbying groups want a hike in direct federal spending instead of tax credits. What is needed most, they say, is money to address the growing backlog of maintenance and repair projects, most of which are unsuitable for tolling. An infrastructure bill that relies on tax credits risks providing a windfall to investors and wouldn't be acceptable to Democrats, Schumer said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This version corrects the amount for the infrastructure fund to $200 billion. \u2014\u2014\u2014 AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP\u2014Joan\u2014Lowy.

By Matt O'Brien By Matt O'Brien January 24 at 10:27 AM Follow @ObsoleteDogma On his fourth day in office, President Trump signed an executive order formally withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Crafted by the Obama administration, the trade deal failed to be ratified by Congress during Obama's two terms. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Donald Trump meant what he said about trade. When he isn't getting attention for telling demonstrable falsehoods about the size of his inauguration crowd, Trump has been busy filling his administration with people who want to get tough on China, threatening to put tariffs on companies that outsource jobs, and, as he did on Monday, pulling the United States out of big trade deals. Indeed, he officially killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and is expected to announce that he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement as well. How much does this matter? Well, when it comes to the TPP, maybe not as much as you might think for an agreement that would have created a single market for most of the Pacific rim other than China. At least not in economic terms. The U.S. International Trade Commission, after all, estimates that the TPP would have raised our inflation-adjusted incomes only by 0.23 percent \u2014 in total \u2014 between now and 2032. That's not nothing, but it's pretty darn close. That's because the TPP wasn't really about reducing tariffs. Those are already quite low for the countries involved. It was more about making other countries follow our rules for patents and intellectual property, raising prices for Asian consumers and profits for American companies. That'd be better for our shareholders, but not necessarily for our workers. In all likelihood, it wouldn't change our jobs picture very much for good or ill. No, the real reason to support the TPP wasn't economics so much as geopolitics. It was about keeping an economic foot firmly planted in China's backyard, and writing the trade rules so they couldn't. If this sounds like a less quantifiable benefit, well, that's because it is. At the same time, though, this kind of logic was a part of almost all our trade deals the past 70 years. Initially, these were about setting a system to promote prosperity abroad so fragile postwar democracies could resist Communist pressure. But even after the Berlin Wall came down, they were still a way to not only open up markets, but also reward countries for reforming their economies like we wanted. As Paul Krugman argued at the time, that was why NAFTA made more sense than any economic model would have told you. If we rejected Mexico's liberalizing government, it might have collapsed \u2014 and an anti-American one could have taken its place. Now, that's not to say that all trade deals are economically irrelevant. They aren't. NAFTA really did move a decent\u00a0chunk of our manufacturing base south of the border, whether a giant sucking sound accompanied it. And granting China Permanent Normal Trade Relations status in 2000 really did seem to give companies the confidence they needed to shift production there \u00a0on a far larger scale than they had before, since\u00a0they no longer had to\u00a0worry about the risk of tariffs rising. What we are saying, though, is that the era of big trade deals is over. And that was true even before Trump announced his candidacy before a raucous crowd of paid actors . The simple story is that we've already pushed tariffs about as low as they can go, and all that's left is to negotiate over non-tariff trade barriers. But the problem is that those sorts of things \u2014 say, rules about intellectual property or government procurement \u2014 are what we used to think of as the sole province of domestic policy. Which is why they can feel like they're infringing on a country's sovereignty. The result is that these new trade deals are more difficult politically and less useful economically than previous ones. But what's changing with Trump is that we aren't\u00a0even trying to lead on trade anymore. He doesn't see these\u00a0deals as a way to win friends and influence people, but rather to win manufacturing jobs and influence his approval rating. That might sound like common sense to some people, but it does leave an opening for other countries \u2014 yes, China \u2014 to negotiate where we're not. The risk, then, is that globalization might not proceed on our terms or with our values. But there's a greater danger. It's not that Trump won't make further progress on trade, but rather will backtrack on where we are. New trade deals might not help much, but unraveling old ones would hurt. At that point, we wouldn't have the luxury of worrying about whose globalization we had. The answer would\u00a0be nobody's. And the whole world would be a little bit poorer. Or as Trump calls it, America would be great again. business ",

    "text": "WATCH Behind Trump's Plan to Move the US Embassy to Jerusalem 0 Shares Email Israel announced plans Tuesday to build 2,500 more settler homes on the West Bank, moving to step up construction just days after the swearing-in of Donald Trump brought to power a U.S. administration seen as friendly to the settlement movement. \"We are building \u2014 and we will continue to build,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote in a Facebook post. White House spokesman Sean Spicer did not answer directly when asked about Trump's reaction. \"Israel continues to be a huge ally of the United States,\" Spicer said. \"He wants to grow closer with Israel to make sure that it gets the full respect that it deserves in the Middle East .\" While Trump has signaled that he will be far more tolerant of Israeli settlement construction than his predecessors, he also has expressed a desire to broker a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians, and siding closely with Israel on such a contentious matter could hurt U.S. credibility. Netanyahu repeatedly clashed with President Barack Obama over settlement construction. Obama, like the rest of the international community, considered the building of settlements on occupied lands claimed by the Palestinians to be an obstacle to peace. Those tensions boiled over last month when the Obama White House allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the settlements as illegal. Trump harshly criticized Obama for going against Israel and promised a new approach after taking office, raising hopes inside Israel's nationalist government for a new era in relations. Trump has already invited Netanyahu to visit the White House next month, and both men, after speaking on the phone Sunday, promised close coordination on a range of sensitive matters, including settlements. Netanyahu's office would not say whether he had consulted with the White House before Tuesday's announcement, but just a day earlier, the prime minister told a meeting of his Likud Party that there should be no surprises for the new president. The construction plans were announced by Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who said in a statement that he and Netanyahu agreed on the approval \"in response to housing needs.\" He said most of the housing units will be built in settlement \"blocs,\" densely populated areas where most settlers already live and which Israel wants to keep under its control under any future peace deal with the Palestinians. Some 100 homes were slated for two smaller settlements. The approvals were for early stages of home development, meaning construction is not expected to begin anytime soon. \"This decision destroys the two-state solution,\" said Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official in the West Bank. \"We call on the international community to hold Israel accountable immediately.\" He said the Israeli government had been encouraged by what it heard from Trump. The Palestinians want the West Bank and east Jerusalem \u2014 areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war \u2014 for their hoped-for state, a position that has wide international backing. In Brussels, the European Union condemned this week's Israeli settlement announcements, saying they \"seriously undermine\" the prospects for a peace deal. \"It is regrettable that Israel is proceeding with this policy, despite the continuous serious international concern and objections, which have been constantly raised at all levels,\" a statement said. Trump has signaled a softer approach to the settlements. Earlier this week, he did not react to an Israeli announcement to build over 560 new homes in east Jerusalem. Both his designated ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, now a top aide and Mideast envoy, have deep ties to the settler movement. Friedman and Kushner's family foundation have both been generous contributors to Beit El, one of the settlements mentioned in Tuesday's announcement. A delegation of settler representatives was invited to Trump's inauguration last week. Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha settlers' council, said he hopes Tuesday's announcement \"is just the beginning of a wave of new building.\" Revivi led the delegation to the inauguration, the first time the movement has received such an invitation. Trump's ties to the settler movement are just one reason Israel's nationalist right is encouraged by the new administration. His campaign platform made no mention of a Palestinian state, a cornerstone of two decades of international diplomacy in the region. Trump also has promised to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move long favored by Israel but vehemently opposed by the Palestinians. Since Trump took over, Netanyahu has been under heavy pressure from the pro-settler Jewish Home Party to move ahead on an explosive bill that would annex Maaleh Adumim, a major settlement near Jerusalem. A vote on the legislation, which threatens to unleash fresh violence and draw international condemnation, was put on hold this week, apparently so Netanyahu could coordinate his policy with the new U.S. administration. Despite the positive signs for Netanyahu, Trump remains something of a wild card. Since taking office, for instance, he has appeared to backpedal from his promise to move the embassy. The Palestinians have warned that moving the embassy would amount to American recognition of Israeli control over east Jerusalem, home to sensitive Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy sites. They say this could trigger religious violence, and they have threatened to cancel their diplomatic recognition of Israel, the basis for past interim peace accords. Neighboring Jordan, which holds custodial rights over Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, has said that moving the embassy would cross a \"red line.\" Jordan is a key American and Israeli ally in the battle against Islamic militants. On Tuesday, the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip warned the U.S. not to move the embassy, saying it could \"open a new chapter of conflict\" and \"add fuel to the fire.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, and Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah, West Bank, contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "News Watchdog The Price of Pork Proposed hog confinement killed after rural neighbors speak out Several residents from around Illinois spoke out against hog confinements during a news conference organized by the\u00a0Illinois Citizens for Clean Air & Water at the Capitol in Springfield. Gary Marx and David Jackson Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Facing opposition from local farmers, one of the state's largest pork producers has pulled its application to build a hog confinement in downstate Fulton County, handing opponents a rare victory in their efforts to slow the growth of the massive livestock facilities in the state. The hog producer, an affiliate of Professional Swine Management, formally withdrew its notice of intent to construct from the Illinois Department of Agriculture last week after sustained protests from neighbors who feared that waste from the proposed 20,000-hog confinement could foul rivers and creeks, and that the operation might ruin roads and jeopardize their rural way of life. \"It's a great thing,\" said Fulton County crop and livestock farmer Matt Howe, referring to the decision to cancel plans for the hog confinement. \"Twenty-thousand animals is a monstrosity. I don't count it as agriculture.\" Two weeks ago, Howe resigned from the Fulton County Farm Bureau's board of directors to protest the group's apparent support for the facility, initially called Cleer Farm and recently changed to Memory Lane Acres. Howe said his own farm and home sit just 3,000 feet from the proposed site. Last Wednesday, the Fulton County Farm Bureau held a meeting in which a handful of farmers voiced continued opposition to the facility, according to Farm Bureau officials and participants. \"They wanted to know our concerns with the hog confinement and why we were opposing it,\" said farmer Craig Porter, who is also a member of the local Isabel Township Board. The next day, Professional Swine Management pulled the plug on the project, though the company could submit a new application that would restart the permitting process, state agricultural officials told the Tribune. Officials with Professional Swine Management could not be reached for comment. Company officials said last month that they would not comment on their plans in Fulton County or any aspects of their business. PRICE OF PORK: Read the series Open link County farm bureaus are part of a politically influential statewide network that says it is dedicated to family farmers but has been criticized for promoting industrial-scale food production. Bill Carlberg, president of the Fulton County Farm Bureau, told the Tribune in a written statement that \"our members had questions and concerns about the Memory Lane farms project, which they expressed to us at a recent meeting.\" The decision to cancel Memory Lane Acres is not the only recent setback for Professional Swine Management, which over the years has withstood periodic opposition from local residents and environmental groups to install 27 hog operations in Illinois, Iowa and Missouri with a total of more than 120,000 sows. In nearby Bernadotte Township, the company's Runway Ridge facility, a proposed 20,000-hog confinement located on farmland near the famed Spoon River, also has stalled in the face of opposition. The Tribune highlighted Fulton County residents' battle against Runway Ridge and Memory Lane Acres as part of its ongoing series, \"The Price of Pork.\" Holding thousands of pigs at a time, modern livestock confinements are designed to store millions of gallons of manure, then apply the waste as fertilizer to nearby farmland. But pollution incidents tied to Illinois hog confinements killed 492,000 fish and impaired 67 miles of streams from 2005... (David Jackson, Gary Marx, Ryan Marx) Waste spills from hog confinements accounted for nearly half of the 1 million fish killed in Illinois water pollution incidents from 2005 to 2014, killing at least 492,000 fish and impairing 67 miles of waterways, the Tribune found. Fulton County commissioners on Dec. 13 passed a resolution urging the state to halt action on Runway Ridge and all new large confinements in the county until \"there is meaningful reform\" to the state law that governs the construction and oversight of the massive livestock operations. The law gives Illinois communities little if any power over the siting of new confinements. The Fulton County resolution urged lawmakers to give communities a voice and \"protect citizens of all counties in the state of Illinois.\" On Tuesday, Howe, Porter and a dozen other small farmers and residents gathered at the state Capitol building in Springfield to launch an effort to persuade legislators to strengthen the Livestock Management Facilities Act, which governs the permitting and siting of hog confinements. Citing the Tribune investigation and describing noxious odors, declining property values, damaged roads and other problems associated with confinements, the speakers urged state legislators to give local authorities the power to approve or deny permits for constructing the massive facilities. \"The LMFA is a toothless tiger,\" said Judy Koehler, a former Republican state representative and Illinois Appellate Court justice who owns land near a hog confinement in western Illinois. \"It is working for 'Big Ag' against the little guy, the family farm.\" Past efforts in Illinois to toughen the livestock facilities law stalled in the face of strong opposition from rural lawmakers backed by farm and livestock associations. But Karen Hudson, co-founder of Illinois Citizens for Clean Air & Water and a longtime critic of confinements, said she hopes the balance of power may be shifting as more local farmers join environmentalists in opposing the livestock facilities. \"We have a growing number of Farm Bureau farmers who are being affected and who are stepping forward,\" Hudson said. Sen. Andy Manar, a Democrat from Bunker Hill who is on the Agriculture Committee, said he would support closing what's known as the \"expansion loophole\" in the law. Currently, many large hog confinements in the state can grow dramatically in size with little or no public input. \"This is a place where we could potentially move forward,\" Manar said. Broader changes would be difficult given the political divisions in Springfield, he added. Another committee member, Democratic Sen. David Koehler of Peoria, said Tuesday that he is committed to reviewing the state livestock facilities act to ensure that current laws protect citizens while at the same time being \"sensitive to the needs of legitimate producers.\" \"Do we have adequate laws and do we have adequate enforcement and do we have adequate transparency? \u2026 I'm just not sure we have a well-functioning system right now,\" said Koehler, who is no relation to Judy Koehler. Republican Rep. Charlie Meier, a grain and livestock farmer from Okawville, cautioned against giving local counties control over the siting of livestock confinements, saying they don't have the necessary expertise or funds to regulate the massive facilities. \"One in six jobs in the state of Illinois are agriculture,\" Meier told the Tribune. \"We need to protect the last thriving business in the state of Illinois.\" ",

    "text": "By Michelle Ye Hee Lee By Michelle Ye Hee Lee January 24 at 2:33 PM Follow @myhlee The Post's Michelle Ye Hee Lee explains why White House press secretary Sean Spicer's claims on Jan. 24 about voter fraud in the presidential election don't add up. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) \u201cI think there have been studies; there was one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who have voted were not citizens. There are other studies that were presented to him.\u201d \u2013White House press secretary Sean Spicer, news briefing, Jan. 24, 2017 Spicer cited repeatedly debunked research to support Trump\u2019s claim that millions of people voted illegally during the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0These studies do not support Trump\u2019s Four-Pinocchio claims of\u00a0\u201cmillions\u201d of people voting illegally \u2014 as we\u2019ve covered\u00a0 here , here , here , here \u00a0and\u00a0 here . Spicer claimed Trump believes there was widespread voter fraud,\u00a0based on studies that were presented to him. Then Spicer cited a Pew study that \u2014 as we noted before \u2014 does not support this claim. Moreover, Spicer conflated the Pew study with another study that \u2014\u00a0 again \u00a0\u2014\u00a0does not support this claim. A 2012 Pew Center on the States study \u00a0found problems with inaccurate voter registrations, people who registered in more than one state (which could happen if the voter moves and registers in the new state without telling the former state) and deceased voters whose information was still on the voter rolls. The primary author of the Pew report tweeted in response to Trump\u2019s staff\u2019s claim that he \u201ccan confirm that report made no findings re: voter fraud.\u201d We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted. \u2014 David Becker (@beckerdavidj) November 28, 2016 Spicer said a Pew study from 2008 showed that \u201c14 percent of people who have voted were not citizens.\u201d He likely was referring to research by Old Dominion University professors, using data from 2008 and 2010. They found that 14 percent of noncitizens in the 2008 and 2010 samples said they were registered to vote. But the researchers warned that \u201cit is impossible to tell for certain whether the noncitizens who responded to the survey were representative of the broader population of noncitizens.\u201d One of the researchers, Jesse Richman, wrote about the Trump staff\u2019s use of his research. The results \u201csuggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions,\u201d he wrote. Despite Trump\u2019s repeated claims, his attorneys stated there was no evidence of voter fraud in the 2016 election.\u00a0 In a court filing opposing\u00a0Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2019s recount petition, lawyers for Trump and his campaign wrote: \u201cAll available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.\u201d When we debunked this claim on Nov. 29, 2016, we implored Trump\u2019s staff members to please drop this talking point \u2014 as we are tired of telling them it is false. We can\u2019t emphasize this point enough. The Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false. These posts are short summaries of previous findings, with links to the original fact-check. We welcome reader suggestions. \u00a0 ",

This is the Bocuse d\u2019Or , or the culinary version of the Olympics. The competition, which takes place this week in Lyon, France, was founded by the master French chef Paul Bocuse. He was influential in establishing nouvelle cuisine, which emphasizes ingredients and presentation. At 89, Mr. Bocuse remains a king among chefs. Long before \u201cfarm-to-table\u201d became a trendy concept, a 15-year-old Mr. Bocuse was learning how to butcher a cow for his first restaurant job. He eventually joined his father at their family restaurant, L\u2019Auberge du Pont de Collonges . One year after taking over, Mr. Bocuse won his first Michelin star. He recalled how, early in his career, he wowed a prominent food critic with fresh ingredients. Mr. Bocuse served haricots verts picked that morning, lightly boiled and served with olive oil, shallots and salt. In 1966, The Times\u2019s Craig Claiborne described the restaurant outside of Lyon as \u201c one of the most elegant and proudest restaurants outside of Paris. \u201d Mr. Bocuse, though, once offered a less refined assessment of his skills. \u201cSome men have mistresses,\u201d Mr. Bocuse once said . \u201cI run a luxury restaurant.\u201d Remy Tumin contributed reporting.

Published 6:28 p.m. ET Jan. 24, 2017 | Updated 3 hours ago This Dec. 27, 2016, file photo provided by the Aiken County Detention Center, S.C., shows South Carolina state Rep. Chris Corley. Corley, who is accused of beating his wife bloody, resigned on Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2017, rather than be expelled from the Statehouse after a grand jury indicted him on a felony aggravated domestic violence charge that could put him in prison for up to 20 years. (Photo: AP) COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 A South Carolina lawmaker accused of assaulting his wife has resigned from office. State Rep. Chris Corley\u2019s decision was announced on the House floor Tuesday afternoon as lawmakers were considering expelling him from office. \u201cEven though I prepared a resolution calling for his removal, I am grateful that the House did not have to take such extraordinary measures and expel Rep. Corley from this Institution, \u201d state House Speaker Jay Lucas said in a statement. Corley, a Republican best known in the legislature as a staunch defender of the Confederate flag, was easily re-elected with no opposition to a second term representing parts of Aiken County. But his troubles at home became public record through a desperate 911 call the day after Christmas. \"Please stop\" can be heard repeatedly in the recording released by the Aiken County Sheriff's Office. \"Just stop daddy. Just stop. ... Daddy, why are you doing this?\" their children say. Kids scream 'just stop daddy' in 911 call from lawmaker's home According to an incident report, Corley and his wife got into an argument back on Dec. 26. During the argument, police say Corley hit his wife, causing her to bleed. Deputies say he later went to a vehicle, came back inside, pointed a gun at her and then threatened to kill himself. Deputies say Corley then went into a bedroom and his wife ran to a home across the street. Corley told deputies that his wife had attempted to strike him in the face after she accused him of cheating. He said he pushed the woman and she scratched his forehead. Corley was charged after deputies spoke with him and the woman. He's facing one count of aggravated domestic violence and one count of pointing and presenting a firearm. Legislative leaders had called on the 36-year-old attorney from Graniteville to resign ahead of the session that started Jan. 10. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, whose district includes much of Corley's, said state leaders had to make clear that \"it's not OK to beat up your wife.\" While Corley is legally innocent until proven guilty, \"there's a big difference between the criminal and political side,\" Massey said. \"It's a bad thing and we ought to be calling it out.\" Lucas suspended Corley from his seat on Jan. 4 shortly after the indictment.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 A former Navy sailor imprisoned for taking photos inside a submarine has sought a pardon from President Donald Trump, who, as a candidate, often cited his case as unjust. Supporters of Kristian Saucier, 29, say the one-year sentence he drew last summer was overly harsh in light of treatment afforded former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over her illegal private email server, and former President Obama\u2019s granting of clemency to Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning, who leaked classified information. Saucier's attorney, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News that he met with Trump's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, about Petty Officer First Class Saucier\u2019s case, and at Flynn\u2019s request submitted a formal pardon request. Daigle said the punishment didn\u2019t fit the crime. Kristian Saucier with his daughter, Kassy, and wife, Sadie (Courtesy of Ronald Daigle) \u201cIt was a hyper-charged political atmosphere,\u201d Daigle said, \u201cpolitics played a role in it.\u201d Saucier, who served as a machinist's mate aboard the USS Alexandria from 2007 to 2012, used his cellphone to photograph parts of the submarine's nuclear propulsion system while it was docked at the Naval Submarine Base in Groton, Conn. Saucier, who is married and has a 2-year-old daughter, began his 12-month sentence in October at the Federal Medical Center at Fort Devens, Mass.\u00a0 He was convicted of unauthorized retention of national defense information, which is a felony, and received an \"other-than-honorable\" discharge from the Navy. He faced a possible 10 years in jail, his lawyers said. His problems began when a worker at the naval base found Saucier\u2019s cellphone near a Dumpster and, while going through it, found the photographs. The worker brought the cellphone to a retired Navy petty officer, who then notified federal agencies about the sensitive submarine pictures. \u201cWhen you look at how many years ago this occurred, coupled with his military service, and other individuals such as Hillary Clinton and [Clinton aide] Huma Abedin, who clearly mishandled classified information, it\u2019s unfair,\u201d said Greg Rinkley, one of the attorneys who represented Saucier. \u201cIt smacks of two types of justice systems in the United States.\u201d Abedin was a Clinton adviser whose estranged husband and former congressman Anthony Weiner was found to have some of the former secretary of state\u2019s emails on his computer when it was seized by federal investigators in connection to another case. Daigle said that when he served as a military police officer in Iraq from 2005 to 2006, he saw \u201chundreds, or thousands\u201d of photos that service personnel had taken that could be considered sensitive. The norm was to handle them in-house, Daigle said. Saucier\u2019s family has said that he took the photos to show his future children what he did aboard the submarine. Tom Carson, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut, declined to comment on Saucier's attorneys' criticisms that prosecutors were overzealous. Carson said in an email to Fox News: \"For any pardon application, when the Office of the Pardon Attorney requests our office's position on a pardon, we will review the application and provide our position.\" At the time of the court proceedings on the charges, prosecutors balked at attempts to compare the petty officer\u2019s actions to those of other officers or even that of Clinton. Noting that intent is crucial when determining punishment, some experts noted that Clinton maintained that she did not know that she was doing anything wrong, whereas Saucier conceded that he believed he should not have been taking the photographs. Acting on behalf of the Navy, Rear Adm. Charles Richard submitted a victim impact statement that described Saucier\u2019s photographs as having \u201chad far-reaching consequences for the United States and the Officers, Sailors and families who serve it.\" \"Therefore, the Navy respectfully requests that the court consider a sentence of confinement, and a fine, at the high end of the applicable range under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines,\" Richard said, according to Military.com Daigle says that the photos he saw while in Iraq, where he had customs duty and had to go through belongings, \u201cwere far worse\u201d than Saucier\u2019s photos. He said that Saucier had an outstanding career, and had wanted to be in the service for the long haul. \u201cKris was an absolute great performer who made rank quickly because he did so well,\u201d Daigle said. Daigle hopes that Saucier receives a pardon that would erase the conviction from his record, and commutation of his sentence.

Mick Mulvaney testifies before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee during his confirmation hearing to be the next director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on\u00a0Jan. 24, 2017. Rep. Mick Mulvaney testifies before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee during his confirmation hearing to be the next director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on\u00a0Jan. 24, 2017. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images) Ylan Q. MuiThe Washington Post President Donald Trump 's nominee to become the nation's budget director, Rep. Mick Mulvaney , R-S.C., defended Tuesday his support of cuts to popular entitlement programs that Trump vowed to keep intact and emphasized that he would bring a \"fact-based approach\" to the role. In appearances before the Senate budget and homeland security committees, Mulvaney acknowledged that several of his key positions on spending and the national debt directly contracted Trump's campaign pledges and statements made by some of the president's top advisers. But Mulvaney presented himself as a \"straight shooter\" and said he would continue to warn about the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare . \"I have no reason to believe the president has changed his mind\" on not touching entitlement programs, Mulvaney said. But, he added, \"My job . . . is to be completely and brutally honest with him.\" Mulvaney would bring a stridently hawkish voice to the Office of Management and Budget. On Tuesday, he said he remains in favor of raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70 but emphasized that he would not reduce benefits for existing recipients. He also reiterated his support for means-testing to qualify for Medicare. Democratic lawmakers voiced concerns that Mulvaney's nomination signalled that Trump was backing away from his promise to leave the programs unchanged. \"The idea and opinions of Mr. Mulvaney are way out of touch,\" budget committee ranking member Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said. \"And more importantly, they are way way out of touch with what President Trump campaigned on.\" During his hearings, Mulvaney confronted recent revelations that he neglected to pay $15,000 in taxes in connection with a household employee. Mulvaney discovered the error during the vetting process following his nomination, drawing sharp rebukes from some Democratic lawmakers. Similar problems plagued several of former President Barack Obama's nominees, including former South Dakota Sen. Tom Daschle for head of Health and Human Services. \"We made a mistake in my family,\" Mulvaney said Tuesday, adding that he has paid the missing taxes. On the fiscal front, Mulvaney has challenged the need to raise the national debt ceiling , and on Tuesday, he said that he believed the federal government should consider prioritizing payments if it were in danger of breaching the limit again. In his hearing before the homeland committee, ranking member Sen. Claire McCaskill , D-Mo., pointed out that his remarks contradicted testimony from Trump's nominee to lead the Treasury Department, Steven Mnuchin, who said during his confirmation hearing last week that \"there should be no uncertainty that we are paying the billls.\" \"What will happen if your views and proposals are adopted wholesale?\" McCaskill told Mulvaney. \"If that happens, I fear that the American people and the global economy are in for a rude awakening.\" Mulvaney also faced scrutiny from his own party Tuesday. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona questioned Mulvaney's support for reductions in defense spending. McCain also called the 2013 government shutdown a \"shameful chapter\" in history. \"You've spent your entire congressional career pitting the debt against the military,\" McCain said. \"\"I am deeply concerned about your lack of support for our military.\" Elected to Congress during the Tea Party wave of 2010, Mulvaney has become known as one of the most vociferous deficit hawks within House GOP ranks. He was a founding member of the conservative Freedom Caucus and was a key driver of the group's efforts to oust former House Speaker Rep. John Boehner in 2015. He supported the government shutdown in 2013 amid an impasse over the Affordable Care Act and proved willing to do so again two years later as part of an effort to defund Planned Parenthood. He is known as an anti-deficit crusader who backs the controversial \"penny plan\" that would cut 1 percent of federal spending every year for five years. Supporters claim it would eliminate the deficit, but critics say it is a haphazard way of chiseling away at popular entitlement programs. \"He has to tell the president exactly what things cost,\" Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said of Mulvaney on Tuesday. \"The president of course sets the agenda, but he deserves a clear-eyed view -- not rose-colored glasses.\" Many of Trump's economic advisers have touted the president's plans to overhaul the tax code and renegotiate trade agreements, measures that they argue will boost annual economic growth to 4 percent or higher. The White House has also proposed an infrastructure package that could total $1 trillion in public and private financing, through the details of the program remain unclear. Mulvaney, along with other key GOP lawmakers, have opposed infrastructure spending in the recent past. Trump's advisers have said relatively little about how they might pay for his agenda - and it could fall to Mulvaney to make sure the numbers add up. Several independent analyses estimate Trump's tax plan alone, which includes slashing the corporate rate and lowering individual taxes, could reduce federal revenue by trillions of dollars over the next decade. Asked about whether tax cuts should be allowed to increase the deficit, Mulvaney said that reforming the tax code could generate economic growth. Trump \"should look first and foremost on the effect on the overall economy,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think the best chance you have to reduce the deficit or balance the budget is to accomplish economic growth.\" Another possible way to balance the books could be to dramatically reduce government spending in other areas. According to the Hill, Trump's staff is considering cuts to the Energy and Commerce departments, along with the elimination of arts programs such as the National Endowment for the Arts, that could lower spending by as much as $10.5 trillion over the next decade. Mulvaney said Tuesday he had not seen those proposals. ",

    "text": "UK Government Loses Brexit Case, Must Consult Parliament By danica kirka, associated press LONDON \u0097 Jan 24, 2017, 4:33 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Why East London Residents Wanted to Leave the EU 0 Shares Email Britain's government warned lawmakers not to try to \"thwart the will of the people\" after the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Prime Minister Theresa May must seek the approval of Parliament before starting the formal process of leaving the European Union. The 8-3 decision forces the government to put a bill before Parliament, giving members of the House of Commons and the unelected House of Lords the chance to debate and potentially offer amendments that could soften the terms of Britain's exit from the EU, known as Brexit. While the government insisted its timetable of starting the talks by the end of March remained on track, some analysts warned that a defeat in the House of Lords, where May does not have a majority, could delay the process by a year or more. \"Parliament will rightly scrutinize and debate this legislation,\" David Davis, the government's Brexit secretary, told the House of Commons after the ruling. \"But I trust no one will seek to make it a vehicle for attempts to thwart the will of the people, or frustrate or delay the process of our exit from the European Union.\" While the ruling won't scuttle Britain's departure, mandated by voters in a June 23 referendum, it once again highlights the uncertainties in negotiating the country's future relationship with the bloc of 500 million people, which is central to trade, immigration and security. The pound has fallen about 20 percent against the dollar since the vote on concern about slower economic growth and reduced investment. May's government fought hard to avoid putting the matter before Parliament, in part because amendments to the legislation could delay her timetable and force her into complicated concessions with her own lawmakers before she even sat across the table before the other 27 members of the EU. \"Unfortunately for businesses and other institutions, Brexit still means uncertainty,\" said Phillip Souta, head of UK public policy at the law firm Clifford Chance. \"Parliament remains divided and the outcome of the negotiations remain unknown.\" Putting the issue before Parliament is not a simple matter. While May holds sway in the House of Commons, the House of Lords have in recent years stalled dozens of pieces of legislation with which they disagreed, including an attempt by May's predecessor to impose welfare cuts on the vulnerable. The government backed down after the delay. \"Defeat in the House of Lords would not stop Brexit from happening, but it could delay it until mid-2020,\" Souta said. The lawsuit was considered the most important constitutional case in a generation because it centered on the question of who ultimately wields power in Britain's system of government: the prime minister and her Cabinet, or Parliament. May had said she would use centuries-old powers known as royal prerogative to invoke Article 50 of the EU treaty and launch two years of exit talks. The powers \u2014 traditionally held by the monarch \u2014 permit decisions about treaties and other specific issues to be made without a vote of Parliament. The prime minister argued that the referendum gave her a mandate to take Britain out of the 28-nation bloc and that discussing the details of her strategy with Parliament would weaken the government's negotiating position. Financial entrepreneur Gina Miller sued to force the government to seek parliamentary approval. Leaving the EU, she said, would change the fundamental rights of citizens and this can't be done without a vote of lawmakers. The Supreme Court agreed. \"The referendum is of great political significance, but the act of Parliament which established it did not say what should happen as a result, so any change in the law to give effect to the referendum must be made in the only way permitted by the U.K. constitution, namely by an act of Parliament,\" Supreme Court President David Neuberger said in reading the decision. \"To proceed otherwise would be a breach of settled constitutional principles stretching back many centuries,\" he said. Significantly, the government did win one argument on Tuesday, with the ruling that the legislatures of the nations that are a part of the United Kingdom \u2014 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 do not need to be consulted on Brexit. Such consultation would likely have led to a significant delay as lawmakers from the regions piled in with their concerns. While the U.K. government has ceded authority over many local issues to these bodies, responsibility for international relations still rests with the government in Westminster. \"Relations with the EU are a matter for the UK government,\" Neuberger said. The government of Scotland, where voters overwhelmingly supported continued EU membership, has been an outspoken opponent of the prime minister's plans for Brexit, and opposition to Tuesday's ruling was immediately evident. The Scottish National Party, the third-largest party in the House of Commons, pledged to put forward 50 amendments. The government may be forced to listen: Any sign that its voice is being ignored will feed into the case of those arguing Scotland should be an independent country. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party wouldn't frustrate the process but would seek to amend the legislation to make sure the government is held \"accountable.\" Miller, co-founder of SCM Direct, an online investment manager, had argued the case wasn't about blocking Brexit but about \"democracy\" and the \"dangerous precedent\" that a government can overrule Parliament. For Miller, who brought the case along with hairdresser Deir Dos Santos, the court's decision meant vindication after months of threats to her security that followed her involvement in the case. The case revolved around an argument that dates back almost 400 years as to whether power ultimately rests in the executive or Parliament. Constitutional expert Andrew Blick, an expert on the Magna Carta at King's College London, said that advocates of withdrawal had long argued that leaving the EU would protect parliamentary sovereignty. \"They claimed that leaving would promote the principle that the U.K. Parliament is the ultimate source of constitutional authority in the UK,\" said Blick, who advised the Welsh government on the case. \"That principle has now come back to bite them.\" Underscoring the importance of the case, May put Attorney General Jeremy Wright in charge of the legal team fighting the suit. Wright had argued the suit was an attempt to put a legal obstacle in the way of enacting the referendum result. The decision is a bad defeat for May and means that the government \"still does not have control of the Brexit timetable,\" said David Allen Green, a lawyer at the London legal firm Preiskel & Co. \"The appeal decision is, however, a victory for the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and a vindication of an independent judiciary,\" Green said. \"The Supreme Court has told the government to get back into its box: A proper process has to be followed.\" 0 Shares ",

Herm, for Reveal) 23 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Richard Boltuck did not plan to spend most of his waking hours fighting with public officials. He just wanted the state to install a left-turn traffic light at an accident-prone intersection near his home in Bethesda, Maryland. This request would drag on for more than eight years, and place Boltuck, an economist, squarely in the center of a national debate over just how transparent state and local governments should be when members of the public request information about dangerous roads, bridges and intersections. His efforts took on new urgency earlier this year, when three members of a family \u2013 en route to a high school play \u2013 died in a horrific accident at the very intersection that was the target of Boltuck\u2019s complaints. As the father, Michael Buarque de Macedo, attempted a left turn on the four-lane state road, his Chevy Volt was hit broadside by a BMW driven by Ogulcan Atakoglu, 20, who police said had been speeding at 115 miles per hour, 70 miles per hour above the speed limit. Buarque de Macedo, 52; his wife, Alessandra, 53; and their 18-year-old son, Thomas, were killed in the February crash; daughter Helena, who was 15 at the time of the accident, survived with substantial injuries. Atakoglu pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to 12 years in prison, which he is appealing. \u201cThis tragedy,\u201d Boltuck said, \u201chighlights the need for the engineering studies we have been requesting.\u201d But Boltuck\u2019s efforts to get those studies from the state were delayed for years. He and others in his neighborhood began asking for the information in 2008, as they sought data to challenge the state\u2019s conclusions that no left-turn light was needed. They were stymied by a little-known provision of federal law that gives states wide latitude to keep important engineering studies and other data secret from members of the public. Often these studies and data form the basis of a ranking system that states use to determine which roads, bridges and intersections merit urgent attention and federal dollars. Known as Section 409, a term well understood by state transportation officials across the country \u2013 but by few others \u2013 federal law 23 U.S. 409 has been interpreted by many state governments and state courts to allow their agencies to keep secret studies, surveys and other data about dangerous roads, bridges and intersections if there is even a remote possibility that someone might one day sue the government for failing to make needed redesigns or repairs. Boltuck bumped up against this barrier when he asked for what he thought were \u201cgarden-variety public records\u201d from Maryland\u2019s highway department. \u201cWe wanted to level the playing field so that both we and the State Highway Administration had the same information,\u201d he said. Instead, his request opened up a legal fight that he ultimately lost. A state administrative law judge said the state was within its rights to withhold certain accident data, analyses and engineering studies, noting that Boltuck might well \u201cwidely disseminate\u201d the information, and that they could eventually find their way into the hands of someone who might sue the state for failing to fix the intersection. But then, state officials \u2013 comfortable that they did not have to provide the documents \u2013 gave Boltuck some of them anyway. With those documents, he and his neighbors, sitting around his kitchen table and examining piles of documents, found that the state had not included seven of 13 accident reports from 2004 to 2007. \u201cThere were several accidents missing from the reports that the state had compiled to decide not to install a turning light,\u201d he said. In July, the Maryland General Assembly approved a bill that backers said would make the selection process for road improvements and repairs more transparent, making public a new ranking system for projects. The measure was vetoed by Gov. Larry Hogan, who said it actually would have the opposite effect and would politicize the process. The legislature overrode Hogan\u2019s veto. But the measure does not address the type of document Boltuck was seeking \u2013 the backup documents and data that inform the selections of projects. Like Maryland, many states shield this information from public disclosure, making it difficult for individuals, corporations and communities to make informed decisions about state spending, public safety and driving patterns. \u201cThis really restricts the ability to hold governments accountable,\u201d said Keith Kessler, a Seattle lawyer who has handled many accident cases and relies on Washington state\u2019s public records law. Kessler said when he does get access to accident data and other information, he mostly gets it piecemeal and then hires an expert to crunch the data, something community groups or individuals rarely can afford. In many states, individual accident reports are available to the public, but the cumulative data and the rankings by the state of specific sites are usually not obtainable. This information gap leaves drivers, school bus dispatchers, truckers, cyclists and pedestrians at a disadvantage, without information that would enable them to avoid dangerous routes. It opens the possibility that the decisions about which site gets fixed and when could be based on favoritism, not objective data. It also forces the public to rely on third parties \u2013 such as insurance companies \u2013 that scrape state accident databases for information about individual accidents, and then offer up their own lists of dangerous intersections, roads and bridges. Without data and access to state studies such as those Boltuck sought, residents who think their community may have been overlooked cannot compare reports to decide whether those third-party sources are accurate and whether states\u2019 decisions are meritorious or misguided. As with most state open government laws, where you live will determine how much information you can get. A few states, notably Kansas and New York, have seen state court rulings that make the documents and data available to the public. In a case brought by the newspaper Newsday, New York state\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, found in 2005 that the federal law doesn\u2019t require that dangerous locations lists \u201cshall be confidential\u201d \u2013 only that they cannot be used in discovery in lawsuits. And the court noted that \u201cif the information is published, it still cannot be entered into evidence,\u201d a step beyond discovery, or the information exchange that takes place before trial. \u201cCongress evidently did not think that the possibility that some plaintiffs would indirectly obtain information justified requiring nondisclosure of the documents for all purposes. If it had wanted to achieve that result, it could have said so,\u201d the New York high court said. Most states keep the information out of public view and away from tenacious residents who might use the information as leverage, to lobby the government to fix the routes. The U.S. Supreme Court endorsed that position in 2003, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas. In Pierce County v. Guillen, the high court concluded that the public interest in getting the roads repaired overcame any efforts by the public to obtain the information a state might collect when it is applying for federal funds. Along with Washington state, a dozen states had sought that ruling: Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Vermont, and the Northern Mariana Islands, which signed onto an amicus brief supporting the secrecy statute. Other states have litigated the issue, such as Tennessee, which exempts the information specifically from its public records law. Some states, including Arizona, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania, are making some of the data public, but usually note that it cannot be used in a court case, and usually leave it to the individual to analyze it. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision said that it was ultimately in the public interest to exempt the studies from discovery, because the studies and data collection systems had been devised to encourage candor among public officials. Congress could reasonably believe, Thomas wrote, that allowing states to collect the information and keep it secret could result in \u201cmore candid discussions of hazardous locations, better informed decisionmaking, and, ultimately, greater safety on our Nation's roads.\u201d For Michael Gendler, a client of Kessler\u2019s, and also a Seattle lawyer, the fight to get state highway data about a bridge had particular significance. Gendler became a quadriplegic after a 2007 bike accident on a local bridge. He soon discovered that there had been other similar accidents on the bridge. But he was stymied in the same way that Boltuck was. A state agency insisted that Gendler had to certify that he would not use the records in a lawsuit against the state or other government agency. Gendler refused. \u201cI ... do not want to waive my right as a citizen to have access to these public records to promote my ability to become fully informed about the history of this bridge and about the conduct of the governmental agency or agencies responsible for providing a reasonably safe road,\u201d he wrote. Gendler said he knew he had to find a work-around, and was fortunate to be able to get the raw data and employ experts, something that is out of reach of most community activists, such as Boltuck. \u201cOur position was we will use our own experts, we just want the accident record, we don\u2019t want any analysis of it, or records,\u201d he said, recounting his legal battle. \u201cIf you are asking for raw data, the states allow you to gather and analyze the raw data.\u201d But he and Kessler relied heavily on the state\u2019s public records law, he said. And getting records, Gendler noted, depends on how effective those laws are. \u201cIf you have a weak public records act, you might not get the records, notwithstanding the obvious horror of your learning that there was that kind of accident so close in time to what happened without corrective action being done or prioritized,\u201d he said. Gendler said that his original request was for accident reports at the same location, Seattle Montlake Bridge, that were held by the Washington State Patrol. He had suspected that the bridge was unsafe for cyclists for almost 10 years, following replacement and repairs of the bridge. The police agency refused unless he would certify that he would not use the records in a lawsuit against the state, a suit he actually was getting ready to file. His refusal to agree was critical to his eventual success in securing an $8 million settlement. The state had maintained that the records were protected under federal law and did not have to be disclosed because they were part of a database, maintained by the state Department of Transportation, that it used to apply for federal funds. Gendler and Kessler, his lawyer, eventually got the information, but not until the case went all the way to the Washington state Supreme Court. That 2012 ruling found that because the state police had to collect the data anyway, and even though another state agency might use it for the secret dangerous roadways ranking system, the data were still subject to public disclosure under the state public records act. In Bethesda, there is still no left-turn signal at the intersection of Braeburn Parkway and River Road. However, after public outcry following this year\u2019s fatal accident the state said in August that it planned to install a flashing light that alerts oncoming drivers that someone ahead in the opposite lane is attempting a left turn. State highway spokesman Dave Buck said at the time, that studies did not warrant the left-turn light that Boltuck had sought. Last month, there was another accident at the site involving high school students, injuring two. But by year\u2019s end, there was no flashing light yet installed. Boltuck says the plan is too little too late. Now he\u2019d prefer to see the left turn prohibited, and the intersection closed. Even if a flashing warning light is installed, he said, the intersection remains \u201cinherently dangerous.\u201d Miranda S.

By Anne Gearan By Anne Gearan January 24 at 5:47 PM Follow @agearan South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was confirmed Tuesday to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, placing a rising Republican political star in charge of advancing President Trump\u2019s agenda in an institution whose effectiveness he has questioned. She will step down from her post in South Carolina to take one of the country\u2019s highest profile diplomatic jobs and one that would burnish her resume for higher office later. Haley, who has no formal diplomatic experience, won significant Democratic support. The vote of 96-4 reflected some Democrats\u2019 view that Haley would be a sensible diplomat and speak her mind in the new administration. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had approved her nomination by voice vote earlier Tuesday. She won praise from Democrats during her confirmation hearing last week, where she freely aired disagreements with Trump on some policy matters and said that the new president would welcome a range of views. View Graphic Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far Haley, who had been critical of Trump as a candidate, voiced heavy skepticism about Russia and optimism about NATO, both deviations from some of Trump\u2019s statements. She unequivocally rejected the idea of a Muslim registry or ban, which Trump has never fully disavowed. She said she is comfortable with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican first\u201d approach and would reassert the traditional role of the United States in recent decades of protecting Israel from United Nations action it considers biased. She also declared her support for moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a shift that Arab leaders have previously said could ignite violence in the Middle East. At her Jan. 18 hearing, Haley questioned the priorities and effectiveness of the world body, which Trump has called a toothless debating society, but said she intends to \u201cfix\u201d what doesn\u2019t work. \u201cI have no problem calling people out,\u201d Haley said. The United Nations is \u201coften at odds with American national interests and American taxpayers,\u201d Haley said, adding that she would use the \u201cleverage\u201d of potential cuts in U.S. funding to demand reform. \u201cWe contribute 22 percent of the U.N.\u2019s budget, far more than any other country. We are a generous nation,\u201d Haley said. \u201cBut we must ask ourselves what good is being accomplished by this disproportionate contribution. Are we getting what we pay for?\u201d View Graphic 9 foreign policy issues the Trump administration will have to face Haley is best known nationally for her handling of the 2015 racially motivated killings of black worshipers at a historic Charleston church, for which she got generally high marks.
