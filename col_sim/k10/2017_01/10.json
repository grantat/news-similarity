Writer, producer and actor Lena Waithe\u00a0is a Chicago native and the creator of \"The Chi,\" an ambitious television drama for Showtime about life on the South Side of Chicago. Privacy Policy Showtime has given the greenlight to a new Chicago-set drama series called \"The Chi,\" created by \"Dear White People\" producer and Chicago native Lena Waithe. I spoke with Waithe not long ago about her plans for the show, which will focus\u00a0on young black men and their lives on the South Side of Chicago. We have become desensitized to the crime stats, she said. \"And I feel like we need it to be humanized, in a way. I think when people think of young black men in Chicago, they think of heartless, emotionless sex machines. That they don't have a soul. And for me, my sister and I were the only girls on our block, so we grew up around young black boys. My uncle has had struggles with addiction and my father has had struggles with addiction, so I know those young men intimately. I know them on a real, personal level.\" The original pilot was shot locally in the fall of 2015. The series has since been redeveloped with Rick Famuyiwa (\"Dope\") on board directing and Jason Mitchell (who played Eazy-E in \"Straight Outta Compton\") among the ensemble cast. Actor and recording artist Common is also an executive producer on the project. \"I want the opportunity to tell stories that are not just about violence, but more about what is life like in a city that is riddled with violence,\" Waithe told me back in November. \"To follow multiple black men from different walks of life, with different goals, and different ideas of what it means to be a man \u2014 and what it looks like trying to survive the South Side of Chicago.\" Writing the pilot, she said, \"I wasn't really focused on the cops. I wanted to do a show about the people sitting in the back seat of the squad car and how they got there. I want to see them eating breakfast that morning before they left their house. If you see that, you have a different perspective on what he looks like now. You feel a connection to him because you saw him sitting at a table with his mom or his brother or whatever, just being a normal human being. You can actually sympathize with him and his journey, no matter what that journey looks like \u2014 and that journey may not always be pretty. ",

Since launching in Chicago in 2013, Divvy has provided nearly 10 million rides and this year broke its record for most rides on a single day. This year through the end of November, more than 3.5 million trips were taken through the bike-sharing program, a 14 percent increase in trips over the same... (Leonor Vivanco) Speaking alongside the mayors of Atlanta, Detroit and Columbus, Ohio, at an event sponsored by Ford and The New York Times in Detroit on Monday, Emanuel touted the 150 miles of bicycle lanes added by his administration and the spread of the Divvy bike-sharing network as a major draw for tech firms and millennial employees. \"Chicago is rated the number one city for bike ... so there's a lot of different ways of thinking about mobility,\" he said. \"It's a lifestyle question.\" Asked in an email whether Emanuel was being serious when he suggested that Divvy is a bigger threat to cabdrivers than Uber, or if he was joking, whether the joke was in good taste given his brother's investment and cabbies' woes, his spokesman Adam Collins wrote, \"Oh, get real. The mayor has always been clear that his little brother doesn't need his help when it comes to his business dealings. Beyond that, it's self-explanatory: Chicago's bike sharing program has been a clear success, having already surpassed 10 million rides taken.\" And the mayor got a laugh when, later at the event, he said  he had appealed to President-elect Donald Trump 's business acumen, rather than his morality, when he advocated on behalf of Chicago's immigrant community during a recent meeting. \"I tried to appeal to him not on the moral component, because I think that's self-evident ... at least I think it's self-evident,\" he said, noting that Trump's major real estate investments are all in sanctuary cities. And he and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed both metaphorically rolled their eyes when Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said he and his fellow mayors had \"an opportunity to help the president-elect evolve.\" \"I gotta get some of that Columbus air!\" Reed said. \"I recommend decaf,\" Emanuel added, sarcastically. kjanssen@chicagotribune.com ",

Enlarge this image A Venezuelan soldier watches over cargo trucks leaving the port in Puerto Cabello, which handles the majority of the country's food imports. Across the chain of command, from high-level generals to the lowest foot soldiers, military officials are using their growing power over the food supply to siphon off wealth for themselves. Ricardo Nunes/AP hide caption toggle caption Ricardo Nunes/AP A Venezuelan soldier watches over cargo trucks leaving the port in Puerto Cabello, which handles the majority of the country's food imports. Across the chain of command, from high-level generals to the lowest foot soldiers, military officials are using their growing power over the food supply to siphon off wealth for themselves. Ricardo Nunes/AP In Venezuela, food has become so scarce it's now being sold on the black market. One person tells the Associated Press, \"it's a better business than drugs.\" And the food traffickers are the very people sworn to protect Venezuela: the nation's military. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro gave the military complete control of the food supply last summer, after people began protesting in the streets over food rationing. Shortages had become so bad that people were even ransacking grocers \u2014 though many were largely empty. These days, hunger remains widespread. But if you venture into the black markets, you'll find foods that aren't available in the state-run supermarkets, \"where people would prefer to shop because it's a lot cheaper,\" says Joshua Goodman, the AP's news director for the Andes. He was part of the AP team that investigated the food trafficking situation. Facing Severe Food Shortages, Venezuela Pushes Urban Gardens \"These goods are only getting into the country because the military is importing them,\" Goodman tells NPR's Audie Cornish. \"And when you see the food sold at these makeshift markets, there's usually military people standing by with weapons, watching over it all, if not actually selling the food directly.\" And the military isn't just running these black markets \u2014 it's getting rich off them, Goodman says. He was part of an AP investigation into the military's role in trafficking food and spoke to Cornish about the findings. An edited transcript of their conversation follows. How does this affect the price of food? Right now there are some things that are incredibly cheap in Venezuela but in incredibly scarce supply. If you're one of the lucky people to get the food at the government-set price, you are doing quite well. But a lot of people can't afford to spend an entire day in line at a state supermarket, only to find the shelves have already been emptied by the time they get through the door. So a lot of people do have to go to the black market to find food. It's a very unfortunate situation. Something like 80 percent of the country right now says they have lost weight because of what they sort of joke is the President Maduro diet \u2014 the forced austerity upon the country. Article continues after sponsorship Venezuela Is Running Out Of Beer Amid Severe Economic Crisis You found lots of examples of how, essentially, the military is getting rich off controlling the food supply \u2014 even when people are trying to bring food into the country. We documented a case of a South American businessman. He admitted to us that he had paid millions of dollars in bribes over the years to bring food into the country. And he really didn't care who he was paying, because the prices [at which] he was able to sell to the government were so sky high \u2014 something like more than double the international price for a shipment of corn, for example. And that made it very easy for him to pay kickbacks to government officials. And of course, that worked its way all down the food chain. This businessman specifically pointed to the food minister right now, who's a military general, or people close to him having received the money that he was paying. Now what's happened to people trying to bring evidence of this corruption to the president? Venezuela right now is a very opaque place. We don't have a lot of info about the internal deliberations of the government. There are some people in the military who clearly are upset with this situation. However, there are some serious entrenched interests within the military who are politically important to President Maduro. He is a man who is a hanging by a thread. ... He does not have the popularity of his predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chavez. And the military for him has become an invaluable crutch in the face of mass street protests and sinking popularity and hyperinflation, almost. So this is a way to keep [the military] paid, frankly. Is that what's going on? It's a way to keep them fed, you could even argue. Because a lot of this food, I'm sure, is going to the families of the military, to feed their own families and friends. And yeah, it puts money in their pocket at a time when there really isn't much money in the country. What has shocked you most about this situation? I think what has shocked me the most is the degree to which the military has really sullied its own reputation. They were seen by many as a disciplined force that could actually provide answers to the serious problems Venezuela is facing. Instead they seem to be much more self-interested, much more corrupt than I had imagined when we started this project. You've talked to a lot of officials in your story. For average Venezuelans \u2013 what are people saying about this? They're outraged. They know fully well that while they're not eating, people are getting rich. This is an issue that touches the stomachs, literally, of every Venezuelan. A lot of Venezuelans who would be sympathetic to the government are very upset over this issue. And when they find out people are actually profiting from it \u2014 it's a potentially explosive situation for the government. ",

From left, Tamika Mallory, a gun control advocate and board member of The Gathering for Justice, a nonprofit founded by Harry Belafonte; Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York; Bob Bland, holding baby, founder of Manufacture New York; and Carmen Perez, executive director of The Gathering for Justice. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Many thousands of women are expected to converge on the nation\u2019s capital for the Women\u2019s March on Washington the day after Donald J. Trump \u2019s inauguration. Jennifer Willis no longer plans to be one of them. Ms. Willis, a 50-year-old wedding minister from South Carolina, had looked forward to taking her daughters to the march. Then she read a post on the Facebook page for the march that made her feel unwelcome because she is white. The post, written by a black activist from Brooklyn who is a march volunteer, advised \u201cwhite allies\u201d to listen more and talk less. It also chided those who, it said, were only now waking up to racism because of the election. \u201cYou don\u2019t just get to join because now you\u2019re scared, too,\u201d read the post. \u201cI was born scared.\u201d Continue reading the main story Stung by the tone, Ms. Willis canceled her trip. \u201cThis is a women\u2019s march,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be allies in equal pay, marriage, adoption. Why is it now about, \u2018White women don\u2019t understand black women\u2019?\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story If all goes as planned, the Jan. 21 march will be a momentous display of unity in protest of a president whose treatment of women came to dominate the campaign\u2019s final weeks. But long before the first buses roll to Washington and sister demonstrations take place in other cities, contentious conversations about race have erupted nearly every day among marchers, exhilarating some and alienating others. In Tennessee, emotions ran high when organizers changed the name of the local march from \u201cWomen\u2019s March on Washington-Nashville\u201d to \u201cPower Together Tennessee, in solidarity with Women\u2019s March on Washington.\u201d While many applauded the name change, which was meant to signal the start of a new social justice movement in Nashville, some complained that the event had turned from a march for all women into a march for black women. In Louisiana, the first state coordinator gave up her volunteer role in part because there were no minority women in leadership positions at that time. \u201cI got a lot of flak locally when I stepped down, from white women who said that I\u2019m alienating a lot of white women,\u201d said Candice Huber, a bookstore owner in New Orleans, who is white. \u201cThey said, \u2018Why do you have to be so divisive?\u2019\u201d In some ways, the discord is by design. Even as they are working to ensure a smooth and unified march next week, the national organizers said they made a deliberate decision to highlight the plight of minority and undocumented immigrant women and provoke uncomfortable discussions about race. \u201cThis was an opportunity to take the conversation to the deep places,\u201d said Linda Sarsour, a Muslim who heads the Arab American Association of New York and is one of four co-chairwomen of the national march. \u201cSometimes you are going to upset people.\u201d The post that offended Ms. Willis was part of that effort. So was the quotation posted on the march\u2019s Facebook page from Bell Hooks, the black feminist, about forging a stronger sisterhood by \u201cconfronting the ways women \u2014 through sex, class and race \u2014 dominated and exploited other women.\u201d In response, a New Jersey woman wrote: \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel not very welcome in this endeavor.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story A debate then ensued about whether white women were just now experiencing what minority women experience daily, or were having a hard time yielding control. A young white woman from Baltimore wrote with bitterness that white women who might have been victims of rape and abuse were being \u201casked to check their privilege,\u201d a catchphrase that refers to people acknowledging their advantages, but which even some liberal women find unduly confrontational. No one involved with the march fears that the rancor will dampen turnout; even many of those who expressed dismay at the tone of the discussion said they still intended to join what is sure to be the largest demonstration yet against the Trump presidency. \u201cI will march,\u201d one wrote on the march\u2019s Facebook page, \u201cHoping that someday soon a sense of unity will occur before it\u2019s too late.\u201d But these debates over race also reflect deeper questions about the future of progressivism in the age of Trump. Should the march highlight what divides women, or what unites them? Is there room for women who have never heard of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d? And at a time when a presidential candidate ran against political correctness and won \u2014 with half of white female voters supporting him \u2014 is this the time to tone down talk about race or to double down? \u201cIf your short-term goal is to get as many people as possible at the march, maybe you don\u2019t want to alienate people,\u201d said Anne Valk, the author of \u201cRadical Sisters,\u201d a book about racial and class differences in the women\u2019s movement. \u201cBut if your longer-term goal is to use the march as a catalyst for progressive social and political change, then that has to include thinking about race and class privilege.\u201d The discord also reflects the variety of women\u2019s rights and liberal causes being represented at the march, as well as a generational divide. Many older white women spent their lives fighting for rights like workplace protections that younger women now take for granted. Many young activists have spent years protesting police tactics and criminal justice policies \u2014 issues they feel too many white liberals have ignored. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cYes, equal pay is an issue,\u201d Ms. Sarsour said. \u201cBut look at the ratio of what white women get paid versus black women and Latina women.\u201d For too long, the march organizers said, the women\u2019s rights movement focused on issues that were important to well-off white women, such as the ability to work outside the home and attain the same high-powered positions that men do. But minority women, they said, have had different priorities. Black women who have worked their whole lives as maids might care more about the minimum wage or police brutality than about seeing a woman in the White House. Undocumented immigrant women might care about abortion rights, they said, but not nearly as much as they worry about being deported. This brand of feminism \u2014 frequently referred to as \u201cintersectionality\u201d \u2014 asks white women to acknowledge that they have had it easier. It speaks candidly about the history of racism, even within the feminist movement itself. The organizers of the 1913 suffrage march on Washington asked black women to march at the back of the parade. The issue of race has followed the march from its inception. The day after the election, Bob Bland, a fashion designer in New York, floated the idea of a march in Washington on Facebook. Within hours, 3,000 people said they would join. Then a friend called to tell Ms. Bland that a woman in Hawaii with a similar page had collected pledges from 12,000 people. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, let\u2019s merge,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bland recalled. As the effort grew, a number of comments on Facebook implored Ms. Bland, who is white, to include minority women on the leadership team. Ms. Bland felt strongly that it was the right thing to do. Within three days of the election, Carmen Perez, a Hispanic activist working on juvenile justice, and Tamika D. Mallory, a gun control activist who is black, joined Ms. Bland. Gloria Steinem , honorary co-chairwoman of the march along with Harry Belafonte , the honorary co-chairman, lauded their approach. \u201cSexism is always made worse by racism \u2014 and vice versa,\u201d she said in an email. Ms. Steinem, who plans to hold a town hall meeting during the march with Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, said even contentious conversations about race were a \u201cgood thing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about knowing each other,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhich is what movements and marches are for.\u201d But the tone of the discussion, particularly online, can become so raw that some would-be marchers feel they are no longer welcome. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Willis, the South Carolina wedding minister, had been looking forward to the salve of rallying with people who share her values, a rarity in her home state, where she said she had been insulted and shouted at for marrying gay couples. But then she read a post by ShiShi Rose, a 27-year-old blogger from Brooklyn. \u201cNow is the time for you to be listening more, talking less,\u201d Ms. Rose wrote. \u201cYou should be reading our books and understanding the roots of racism and white supremacy. Listening to our speeches. You should be drowning yourselves in our poetry.\u201d It rubbed Ms. Willis the wrong way. \u201cHow do you know that I\u2019m not reading black poetry?\u201d she asked in an interview. Ms. Willis says that she understands being born white gives her advantages, and that she is always open to learning more about the struggles of others. But, she said, \u201cThe last thing that is going to make me endeared to you, to know you and love you more, is if you are sitting there wagging your finger at me.\u201d Ms. Rose said in an interview that the intention of the post was not to weed people out but rather to make them understand that they had a lot of learning to do. \u201cI needed them to understand that they don\u2019t just get to join the march and not check their privilege constantly,\u201d she said. That phrase \u2014 check your privilege \u2014 exasperates Ms. Willis. She asked a reporter: \u201cCan you please tell me what that means?\u201d ",

Verizon announced the $4.8 billion deal in July , ending months of speculation Yahoo's future after it said it was reviewing \"strategic alternatives\" in light of years of management instability. Mayer said at the time the deal was announced that she intended to continue as CEO. But in a brief filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Yahoo said Mayer and company co-founder David Filo will leave once Verizon takes control of its operating business. (A separate unit dealing mainly with Yahoo's partnership with the Chinese giant Alibaba will be spun off into a separate company, to be named Altaba, the company said.) Four other board members are leaving with Mayer and Filo, according to document, which was filed under SEC requirements that any major developments involving a prominent public company be made public. Yahoo Chief Executive at a news conference in New York in May 2013. AP None of their departures are related to \"any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices,\" according to the document. Tim Armstrong, chief executive of Yahoo's AOL unit, has often been mentioned as a potential CEO for the new combined company under Verizon. Mayer, one of Google Inc.'s first employees, signed on as Yahoo's chief executive in 2012 after it was revealed that a previous CEO, Scott Thompson, had misrepresented his credentials. Her appointment was widely publicized, vaulting her to the top level of Silicon Valley giants, and hailed as a milestone for women in tech. But her tenure has been a rocky one. In 2013, Yahoo bought the online blogging site Tumblr. But last month, it was revealed that more than 1 billion Yahoo accounts may have been exposed that same year after a third-party hacker hit the company. Alex Johnson ",

    "text": "Trump gets revenge, helps oust Kasich loyalist from Ohio GOP post Published               January 09, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump claimed some measure of political revenge against Ohio Gov. John Kasich for shunning his presidential campaign, after helping oust a key Kasich loyalist from atop the state Republican party. Trump threw his support behind Jane Timken, who on Friday narrowly defeated Ohio GOP Chairman Matt Borges. The president-elect even got personally involved, calling members of the 66-person Central Committee to lobby on Timken's behalf.\u00a0 \"At first I thought it was a fake phone call,\" Cincinnati-area committee member Greg Simpson told Cleveland.com . \"Then all of the sudden, he's talking to me.\" Simpson said Trump touted Timken, a party activist and donor, without bashing Borges, who last year offered only lukewarm support for Trump\u2019s campaign. Borges appeared largely caught in the political crossfire, considering Kasich, a failed 2016 GOP presidential candidate, refused to endorse Trump after he won the party primary, despite signing a pledge to support the eventual nominee. Kasich then refused to officially attend the Republican convention this past summer in Cleveland, despite being governor of the host state. By the numbers, Borges logged a strong track record since becoming chairman in 2013. He led Ohio Republicans in going undefeated in statewide races in 2014 and 2016, helped thwart Democrats\u2019 attempt this year to unseat incumbent GOP Sen. Rob Portman, delivered votes in battleground Ohio for Trump and brought a major party convention to the state for the first time in 80 years. \u201cThis run \u2026 as chairman of the party has been really the most exceptional experience, professional, of my entire life,\u201d said Borges, who also suggested that he was pleased the outcome of the chairmanship vote could bring Kasich and Trump closer. \u00a0 Still, Borges was at least partially responsible for drawing Trump's ire. He said last summer on Twitter that then-Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort \u201cstill has a lot to learn about Ohio politics\u201d and that Manafort \u201cdoesn't know what he's talking about.\u201d The campaign later suggested\u00a0Borges was hopping on the Trump bandwagon late in the race to further his career, with an eye on becoming the next Republican National Committee chairman.\u00a0 \"It's no great secret that Chairman Borges was never fully on board, but his actions over the past week demonstrate that his loyalties to Governor John Kasich's failed presidential campaign eclipse his responsibility as chairman of the Ohio Republican Party,\" Trump\u2019s Ohio campaign manager, Rob Paduchik, said in an October letter to the state central committee.\u00a0 Paduchik, who is Trump\u2019s pick for RNC co-chairman, also reportedly appealed to committee members to vote for Timken, which has resulted in a complaint that such meddling is in violation of RNC rules. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Storm Floods Vineyards, Forces Evacuations in Calif., Nevada By ellen knickmeyer, associated press FORESTVILLE, Calif. \u0097 Jan 9, 2017, 3:08 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Deadly Winter Storms Hit Both US Coasts This Weekend 0 Shares Email A massive storm system stretching from California into Nevada lifted rivers climbing out of their banks, flooded vineyards and forced people to evacuate after warnings that hillsides parched by wildfires could give way to mudslides. Northern California's Russian River rose to its highest level since 2006, and schools and roads were closed across the wine-making region of Sonoma County, where thousands of people were without power. Avalanche concerns kept some California ski areas closed for a second day Monday in the Sierra Nevada. Forecasters said more snow and rain was on the way. In Nevada near Reno, Nevada National Guard high-water vehicles were deployed to help people evacuate from a town. The Russian River is prone to flooding, but this year's flood has been particularly worrisome because it threatened to topple trees weakened by six years of drought. Jeff Watts, an artist, spent an anxious night listening for the sound of falling trees on his land. On Monday, he found his drive to work blocked by a tree that had fallen on a car. Emergency crews were working to extract the vehicle. \"I couldn't get past the tree, so I turned around and I'm doing this,\" said Watts, who had pulled over to photograph oak trees and their reflections in the floodwater. Over the weekend, toppled trees crashed against cars and homes and blocked roads in the San Francisco Bay Area. Stranded motorists had to be rescued from cars stuck on flooded roads. A giant tree fell across a highway in Hillsborough to the south of San Francisco, injuring a driver who couldn't brake in time and drove into the tree. And a woman was killed Saturday by a falling tree while she took a walk on a golf course. To the south near Los Angeles, commuters were warned of possible highway flooding and mudslides in hilly areas. Emergency workers in Nevada voluntarily evacuated about 1,300 people from 400 homes in a Reno neighborhood as the Truckee River overflowed and drainage ditches backed up. Schools were also canceled in Reno and Sparks, and Gov. Brian Sandoval told all nonessential state government workers to stay home Monday after he declared a state of emergency. The back-to-back storms that have hit California and Nevada since last week are part of an \"atmospheric river\" weather system that draws precipitation from the Pacific Ocean as far west as Hawaii. Such systems pose catastrophic risks for areas hit by the heaviest rain. In California's Calaveras Big Trees State park, a well-known giant sequoia tree known for the huge tunnel carved through its trunk that cars once passed through came toppling down, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. Park volunteer Joan Allday said the tree had been weakening and leaning severely to one side for several years. \"It was barely alive. There was one branch alive at the top,\" she told the newspaper. Meanwhile, rescue teams mobilized in and around Forestville on Monday. A helicopter circled overhead after emergency crews spotted a vehicle submerged on a flooded road. Rescuers also removed about 15 people from a youth probation camp near the river, Fire Chief Max Ming said, adding that authorities rescued a homeless man trapped by the river overnight. Michelle Wolfe, a substitute teacher who lives in Forestville, evacuated from her mobile home park Sunday along with others, taking her RV to a parking lot on higher ground. On Monday, she returned to see gray-brown floodwater covering where her home had been. \"It was odd, seeing what it looked like,\" Wolfe said. \"We're all safe, and that's the most important thing.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Christopher Weber in Los Angeles and Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, contributed. 0 Shares ",

Wayne Brady attends the BET Honoros held at the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 8, 2014. (Olivier Douliery / McClatchy-Tribune) Chris JonesChicago Tribune As first reported by the Tribune last week , Wayne Brady is indeed joining the Chicago cast of \"Hamilton\" in the major role of Aaron Burr. The producer of the hit show, Jeffrey Seller, made the casting official on Monday afternoon and provided the dates for what will be a relatively short stay in Chicago for Brady - he will appear in the role from Jan. 17 through Apr. 9. The actor and host of the game shows \"Whose Line Is it Anyway?\" and \"Let's Make a Deal\" will replace Joshua Henry, who is leaving the Chicago production to join the first national tour of \"Hamilton,\" which begins on the West Coast in March. His casting represents the first time that the show has employed a previously established star name in any role (aside, that is, from the creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda). Henry has said on Twitter that his last show in Chicago will be Jan. 15. \"Hamilton\" plays in an open run at the PrivateBank Theatre in downtown Chicago. RELATED STORIES: ",

Orange County prosecutors say charges will be dropped against Hadley. Angela Maria Diaz, left, is accused of trying to frame Michelle Suzanne Hadley, right, seen in a booking photo from June. Orange County prosecutors say charges will be dropped against Hadley. (Maricopa County Sheriff's Office / Orange County district attorney's office) Christopher Goffard Contact Reporter A Phoenix woman has been accused of posing as the victim of a fabricated Craigslist \"rape fantasy\" ad to frame her husband's ex-girlfriend. Angela Maria Diaz, 31, faces charges of kidnapping, false imprisonment and falsely reporting crimes, along with other charges. Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said Monday that charges will be dropped against Michelle Suzanne Hadley, a 30-year-old Ontario woman who had been facing the possibility of life in prison if convicted of charges related to the alleged frame-up. \"Ms. Hadley is an innocent victim of a diabolical scheme,\" Rackauckas said in a news\u00a0release. In July, the district attorney\u2019s\u00a0office announced that\u00a0\u00a0Hadley was being charged with 10 felonies, including stalking, making threats, assault and attempted forcible rape. Prosecutors said at the time that\u00a0Hadley had apparently stalked and threatened Diaz, the wife of a U.S. marshal who had dated Hadley\u00a0for two years before his marriage. Hadley had been accused of going on Craigslist in June 2016 and posing as Diaz, advertising that she wanted to engage in \u201crape fantasies\" and furnishing photos of Diaz and details about her routines. According to the district attorney\u2019s office, the online solicitation announced that Diaz wanted men to have forcible sex with her, \"even if she screamed or resisted.\" Last summer, in announcing charges against Hadley, authorities said men had appeared at Diaz's home with the intention of raping her, and one actually attacked her but fled before police arrived. After Hadley was arrested in June and bailed out, she was accused of continuing the harassment against Diaz. Hadley was arrested again in July and held on $1-million bail.\u00a0 The district attorney\u2019s office said Hadley was released in October, after evidence materialized \u2014 in part thanks to her attorney \u2014\u00a0pointing to her innocence.\u00a0 The district attorney now says that Diaz herself was behind the Craigslist ad. RELATED: Framed, a mystery in six parts \u00bb Prosecutors now say that Diaz sent emails to herself while making it appear that Hadley sent them, and that Diaz made false claims that Hadley had threatened her life and that of her unborn child. Diaz is also\u00a0accused of faking cervical cancer, faking a pregnancy, forging a check, posing as an attorney and as two of her husband's ex-girlfriends, and forging doctor's notes. The district attorney\u2019s office said Diaz was arrested Jan. 6 in Phoenix and is awaiting extradition to Orange County. Hadley has been living in the shadows, according to her attorney, Michael Guisti. \"Her life has been pretty much taken away from her. She feels the eyes of everyone on her when she goes out \u2014 wondering if she is that person who did all those things \u2014 so she stays inside,\" he said of Hadley, who spent 88 days in jail. Prosecutors officially dropped the charges against Hadley on Monday afternoon at a brief hearing at the courthouse in Fullerton. \u201cYou are free to go,\u201d Judge Beatriz Gordon told her. Hadley wept, smiled and embraced family members. \u201cThis has been a huge nightmare for me \u2014 probably the most traumatic experience of my life,\u201d Hadley told reporters on the courthouse steps. She said she had been pursuing an MBA at Chapman University, and \u201cthis put a little wrinkle in the plan,\u201d though she still hoped to graduate soon. \u201cNothing has ever stopped me before.\u201d\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \"La La Land\" was the big winner at the Golden Globes , what values does Hollywood promote? , storms have slammed Northern California , Thomas Barrack\u2019s latest gig is planning the president-elect's inauguration .

Related: Fort Lauderdale Shooting: Shocking New Video Shows Moment Rampage Began That fact pattern has renewed calls from experts who believe the FBI needs to extend some greater level of scrutiny to people who appear threatening but whose actions do not merit a traditional criminal investigation. FBI officials are strongly pushing back, arguing that Santiago's interactions in Anchorage are the kind that happen in FBI offices across the country nearly every day, and that the bureau has neither the resources nor the legal mandate to track such people. John Cohen, a Rutgers University professor and former counter terrorism coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security, has long argued that the FBI should borrow a page from the Secret Service, which regularly monitors and assesses people, including mentally disturbed people, who have voiced threats against the president and other protectees but whose actions have not reached the level of a crime. Agents will visit them in their homes, track their social media and otherwise seek to intervene with them, Cohen said. If a person is deemed a risk but not a criminal, the Secret Service employs any number of strategies to prevent an attack, Cohen said, including facilitating mental health treatment. Cohen argues that the Attorney General's guidelines governing FBI criminal procedures, which require a finding of a crime or a threat to national security to move forward with a field investigation, should be expanded. A system should be put in place, he says, to refer potential threats to state and local authorities and mental health counseling, without losing track of them. \"We take more of a behavioral and psychological approach, [the] FBI tends to take a legal approach.\" \"Guidelines governing the evaluation of potential terrorist threats need to be adjusted so that the FBI has greater flexibility when assessing the risk posed by someone who has been brought to their attention,\" said Cohen, who is studying mass casualty attacks. \"Behavioral assessment protocols and threat management strategies have proven highly effective in preventing assassinations school shootings and other acts of violence, and those same tools should be available on a consistent basis to counter terrorism investigators.\" As of now, \"if it doesn't cross the legal threshold, it's a hand-off approach,\" said Seamus Hughes, a former U.S. intelligence analyst who is deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. \"There is not a standard process when it comes to mental health or a 15-year-old kid who speaks in favor of ISIS. There is no non law enforcement approach to that.\" Related: Gun Used by Airport Shooting Suspect Was Once Taken Away From Him \u2014 Then Returned A senior FBI counter terrorism official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, said it wasn't practically feasible for the FBI to investigate people who did what Santiago did in Anchorage, nor is he sure a majority of the public would stand for it. \"The American public through Congress has long said it doesn't want the FBI conducting investigations without cause \u2014 spying on citizens,\" he said. The public and the news media focus on the handful of people who went on to violence after interactions with the FBI, he lamented. What that misses, he said, is that the bureau receives as many as 50,000 terrorist tips a year, and conducts more than 15,000 assessments. In contrast, the Secret Service is dealing with fewer than 10,000 threats yearly, according to former senior Secret Service official Jim Helminski. Play ",

Follow our reporters as we provide live coverage and analysis. Joe Drape Reporter 7:19 PM ET Hi, Joe Drape here. I once had the college beat for the Times and covered the first Bowl Championship Series  title game. Back in the day, as the kids say, a compendium of human polls and computer rankings, including the long and thankfully gone New York Times Computer Ranking, matched the nation\u2019s two best teams. It was Tennessee over Florida State 23-16. It turned out that game was a small step for the bowls, but a giant leap for playoff-kind that led us to these playoffs. Along with Marc Tracy and Victor Mather, I will be sharing my wit and wisdom about America\u2019s real national pastime. Marc Tracy Reporter 7:22 PM ET I am settled in here at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa (next to my colleague Sam Borden, who will be writing the game story). A few players are starting to warm up on the field. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, although perhaps I should not be surprised, but my strong suspicion is there are more Clemson than Alabama fans here tonight. In fairness Alabama has played at least one playoff game in six of the past eight seasons, including this one. Jeff Furticella Fans outside Raymond James Stadium before the College Football Playoff Championship. Credit Chris O'Meara/Associated Press Marc Tracy Reporter 7:32 PM ET I just returned from field level and it is hopping. I particularly appreciate Clemson\u2019s orange-and-white uniforms, with purple only in one place on their pants, and the end zones painted black with each team\u2019s names. Marc Tracy Reporter 7:35 PM ET Am honored to be joined by my colleague Joe Drape. I covered the first College Football Playoff national championship game, in 2015; Joe covered the first Bowl Championship Series national championship game, in 1999. Joe \u2014 good game? Joe Drape Reporter 7:39 PM ET Marc, it was a good game and a massive upset as Tennessee and quarterback Tee Martin beat Florida State and their 26-year old quarterback Chris Weinke. It was the era of Free Shoes U and Bobby Dadgum Bowden. Marc Tracy Reporter 7:42 PM ET A favorite joke of my father\u2019s, from vintage Saturday Night Live, had Bill Murray on Weekend Update right after the pope-who-lasted-one-month died, beginning a joke: \u201cWell, the pope died\u2014\u201d and then interrupting himself: \u201cHey, we did this joke last month!\u201d Marc Tracy Reporter 7:45 PM ET It feels a little similar with the same two teams playing each other for the second consecutive year. Not only is this the first consecutive years rematch in title game history; it is the first rematch, period. Marc Tracy Reporter 7:46 PM ET Which is an especially amazing stat because this is an oligarchic sport: only \u2026 hold on a minute \u2026 16 programs have even played in one of these 19 title games. Joe Drape Reporter 7:49 PM ET That\u2019s an amazing stat and, if you look back, it has been dominated by Southern powers - Florida State, Miami, Texas, Auburn, L.S.U., and Alabama of course. I know Notre Dame and Ohio State have shown up on occasion, but there is a reason football is king in the South. Joe Drape Reporter 7:50 PM ET The bad thing about tonight is that we don\u2019t have a red carpet to kill time while we are waiting for kick off. Joe Drape Reporter 7:58 PM ET Among the great joys of a big college football game is how gamblers see it.  Our guys in The Upshot call it the predictive markets. I call it sharp or wise guy money. Here\u2019s a few indicators before you pull your trigger on the off-shore account from our friends at William Hill in Nevada. Line is currently at Alabama -6.5.  Over/Under Total is at 51.5. We\u2019ve taken over double the money on Clemson vs Alabama compared to the most popular of the four Wild Card games (Giants vs Packers) at our 108 Nevada Sports Books & app. Largest single bet is a six-figure ticket on Clemson +6.5. 58% of the Point Spread Tickets and 64% of the $ is on Clemson to cover. 61% of Total Points Tickets and 61% Total Point Dollars wagered is on OVER. Most Popular Prop is YES on there being Overtime tonight +650. Marc Tracy Reporter 8:03 PM ET Joe, what do you make of the majority of the money being on Clemson to cover? I imagine Alabama is the \u201cpublic\u201d team, the one that casual fans instinctively put money on (a la the Steelers, the Cowboys, the Packers). I will say that it seems consistent to bet on Clemson to cover and for OVER \u2014 Clemson would like to make this a shootout, it means they\u2019ll have overcome Alabama\u2019s insane defense and forced true freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts to throw the ball.

Friday, December 16, 2016. Reuben Goodwin Sr. as he arrives to court on the 24th floor of the Daley Center. Friday, December 16, 2016. (Brian Jackson / Chicago Tribune) Patricia Callahan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The last of the residents who went missing when Illinois licensing officials shut down their group homes was found safe with family on Friday, ending a search that had dragged on for weeks, according to a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Human Services. Citing safety violations, state regulators revoked the license of Disability Services of Illinois' network of eight group homes on Nov. 28 and said they planned to move all 45 residents with developmental disabilities to safer homes managed by other providers. The transition devolved into a heated court battle, with Disability Services arguing that the state was unfairly shutting down the business and attorneys for Human Services complaining that group home employees were thwarting efforts to relocate residents. Cook County Circuit Court Judge Kathleen Pantle last month declined to halt the shutdown and then set a deadline for Disability Services to turn over remaining residents to caseworkers, who planned to move them to new homes. That deadline passed with many residents still missing. Disability Services CEO Reuben Goodwin Sr. said the residents went home with family members for the holidays, though in many instances he and his employees could not name the relatives or provide phone numbers. He said the missing residents, who served as their own guardians, came and went as they chose. Some residents who were later found told caseworkers that Disability Services employees had said people were trying to kidnap them, turned out lights in the homes and told them to hide when searchers \u2014 including police \u2014 came looking for them, according to caseworker affidavits filed in the court dispute.

USA TODAY Sports Giants WR Odell Beckham failed to make much of an impact in Sunday's playoff loss at Green Bay. (Photo: Jerry Lai, USA TODAY Sports) Even with the New York Giants' season now over, Odell Beckham Jr. remains in the headlines. One week after the three-time Pro Bowler and his fellow Giants receivers spent their day off partying in Miami\u00a0\u2014 six days before a wild-card loss to the Green Bay Packers when those same players were guilty of dropping several Eli Manning passes\u00a0\u2014 New York general manager Jerry Reese sent a warning shot across Beckham's blonde bow. \"We all have had to grow up at different times in our lives, and I think it is time for him to do that,\" Reese said in a press conference Monday. \"He has been here for three years now and is a little bit of a lightning rod because of what he does on the football field, but the things he does off the football field, he has to be responsible for those things and we will talk through it. I know he is a smart guy, and I believe he understands that he has a responsibility being one of the faces of this franchise, and I think he will accept that responsibility.\" Tom Brady says he can relate to Odell Beckham Jr.'s trip to Miami Reese did not believe Beckham's trip to Florida had any bearing on the Giants' 38-13 loss Sunday but had to field questions about a hole in the wall at Lambeau Field allegedly created in\u00a0one of the receiver's emotional outbursts. The Giants are holding an investigation, and Reese spoke to Beckham on Monday. \"This is what I see \u2014 I see a guy who needs to think about some of the things that he does,\" said Reese without saying whether Beckham was responsible for the hole. \"Everybody knows that he is a gifted player, but there are some things that he has done that he needs to look at himself in the mirror and be honest with himself about, and I think he will do that. We will help him with that, but he has to help himself, and we believe he will do that. He is a smart guy, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t do smart things.\" Ranking the NFL's divisional playoff teams 1-8 With at least 90 catches, 1,300 yards and 10 touchdowns in each of his first three seasons\u00a0\u2014 plus a slew of highlight-reel, one-handed receptions\u00a0\u2014 Beckham is off to a historic start while establishing himself as an elite talent. But his on-field scrapes with players like Josh Norman, sideline tantrums and attention-grabbing episodes like proposing marriage to a kicking net have made Beckham a detriment on multiple occasions. But Beckham's quarterback, often seen trying to calm him during games, remains supportive. \"I don\u2019t have concerns. I think Odell is passionate. He\u2019s passionate and he wants to win,\" Manning said Monday. \"This was important for him. He wanted to go out there and have the best game of his career. Maybe he put too much pressure on himself and emphasis. Unfortunately, going to the playoffs is different. \"I hate to say that when I\u2019m in my 13th year, but sometimes guys just have to go through it and see what it\u2019s like. Understand that they can\u2019t make it bigger than what it is. You have to have a calm mindset and just go out there and play football. Be relaxed and bring out your best. Don\u2019t try to play your best, you just have to trust the training and just go do it. I think Odell is going to be fine. He\u2019s learning every year and this is another learning experience for him.\" *** Follow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis PHOTOS: NFL wild-card action Posted!

The arrest was recorded and streamed live on Facebook, as The Two-Way reported at the time: \"The events unfolded in southwest Fort Worth, where Jacqueline Craig called police to say a man had grabbed and choked her 7-year-old son after accusing him of littering. But after an officer responded to the call, the two engaged in a heated argument as bystanders, including Craig's relatives, looked on. \"In the nearly 6-minute video that's now been viewed some 2.5 million times on Facebook , the responding officer is seen questioning Craig, as she says the man should have spoken to her about her son. The video was posted by Porsha Craver, Craig's niece who used a smartphone to film a screen showing the original footage \u2014 and who offers her own comments about the police encounter.\" Immediately after the incident, the officer in the video was \"placed on restricted duty status by the Chief of Police\" pending the outcome of an Internal Affairs investigation, the Fort Worth Police Department said. Article continues after sponsorship The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that the officer, William Martin was \"contrite\" and \"sorry\" about the incident, according to police Chief Joel Fitzgerald, who called the suspension \"significant punishment\" during a news conference Monday. The newspaper continued: \"Both Mayor Betsy Price and Fitzgerald said the situation was an isolated incident. He said various videos were reviewed during the investigation. 'We left no stone unturned,' Fitzgerald said. \"The chief said the decision to suspended Martin for 10 days was his, and some members of the department's command staff disagreed, [saying] he should have been more lenient. \" 'But the buck stops here,' Fitzgerald said. He said Martin showed neglect of duty and discourtesy. He said the officer will undergo training before he returns to duty.\" Craig told the Dallas Morning News she wanted the charges against her dropped. The newspaper reported that the charges include interference with public duty, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and failing to provide identification. The Star-Telegram says the charges have been forwarded to the district attorney, who will decide whether to prosecute. ",

Trump Son-in-Law Jared Kushner to Be Named Senior White House Adviser https://t.co/GGmpeUq2oA \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 9, 2017 Kushner will resign from his company, divest \"substantial assets,\" and recuse himself from matters that would impact his financial interests, Gorelick said. His remaining assets will be purchased by a trust. But he may also be challenged on a federal anti-nepotism law aimed at preventing officials from appointing relatives to government positions. The law prohibits elected officials from appointing relatives to Cabinet positions, but may not apply to a job as White House adviser. However that is not completely certain. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shakes hands with son-in-law Jared Kushner (R) during an election night party at a hotel in New York. MANDEL NGAN / AFP/Getty Images \"We don't think that the nepotism issue is a close question,\" an attorney advising the Trump transition said. The official said there is legal precedent for the president making White House hires \"without regard\" to federal personnel laws like the anti-nepotism statute. Kuschner will also not take a salary, which the official said will help combat any challenges on anti-nepotism laws. Like his father-in-law, Kushner is a real-estate developer in New York City . He is the co-owner of Kushner Companies and in 2006 bought the New York Observer newspaper. Kushner's business dealings have come under scrutiny since Trump's election victory. The New York Times reported last week Kushner was working on a deal with a major Chinese financial group with close ties to the Chinese government. The Kushner family business has done billions of dollars of business with foreign companies that threatens to complicate his role at the White House. Trump is expected to address Kushner's position along with how he'll handle his own potential business conflicts at a press conference on Wednesday, his first since the November election. Kushner is married to Ivanka Trump. He said in a statement he is \"energized\" and \"humbled\" by the opportunity. Kristen Welker ",

Spencer Platt/Getty Images Donald Trump has named his son-in-law to a top White House job. Jared Kushner will serve as a senior adviser to the president, and the transition team says he will work with incoming Chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Stephen Bannon \"to execute President-elect Trump's agenda.\" Best News of the Day. Trump Son-in-Law Jared Kushner to Be Named Senior White House Adviser https://t.co/GGmpeUq2oA \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 9, 2017 The announcement also says Kushner will not receive a salary while serving in the Trump administration, which could help alleviate legal problems stemming from federal anti-nepotism law. The Rise Of Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's Son-In-Law Kushner, a 36-year-old real estate developer and publisher of the New York Observer, has been married to Trump's daughter Ivanka since 2009. When it was reported last week that they would be moving to Washington, D.C., it fed into speculation that one or both would serve as advisers in the Trump administration. \"Jared has been a tremendous asset and trusted advisor throughout the campaign and transition and I am proud to have him in a key leadership role in my administration,\" Trump said in a statement, nothing Kushner's success in business and politics, with his role in the inner circle of the president-elect's 2016 campaign. In the statement, Kushner said, \"It is an honor to serve our country. I am energized by the shared passion of the President-elect and the American people and I am humbled by the opportunity to join this very talented team.\" Bringing family members into the White House may prove difficult, though. That's because of a 1967 anti-nepotism law, inspired by another famous family, as NPR's Jim Zarroli recently reported : \"The anti-nepotism law was passed by Congress in response to President John F. Kennedy's decision to appoint his brother Robert as attorney general, says Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \" 'It was very controversial at the time. Lyndon Johnson in particular did not like that, and when he became president he helped shepherd this anti-nepotism law through the U.S. Congress,' West says.\" Article continues after sponsorship But it's not entirely clear what that law means. Here is what the statute lays out, as NPR's Ailsa Chang reported in November : \"A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official.\" What Role Will Ivanka Trump Play In Her Father's Administration?

Kushner, one of the most influential voices in Trump's inner circle, is credited with helping steer the presidential campaign to victory and has been expected to continue in a close advisory role to Trump after he takes office Jan. 20. When Trump made his first visit to the White House after the election, Kushner was among the few advisers to accompany him and had a private meeting with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough . How Nepotism Law Might Affect Jared Kushner and Trump's White House Trump today would not discuss Kushner's role in the incoming administration, saying he will speak more about it during his Wednesday press conference. \"Oh, we'll talk about that on Wednesday,\" Trump told reporters today at Trump Tower in New York City. Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo Jared Kushner, son-in-law of of President-elect Donald Trump walks from Trump Tower, in New York City, Nov. 14, 2016. Kushner is preparing to resign from his position at Kushner Companies and \"divest substantial assets,\" said Jamie Gorelick, his attorney and partner at the law firm of WilmerHale. Gorelick would not comment specifically on the report that Kushner will be named a senior adviser to the president but said Kushner is committed to complying with ethics laws. \"Mr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take. Although plans are not finalized, Mr. Kushner would resign from his position at Kushner Companies and divest substantial assets in accordance with federal guidelines. He would recuse from particular matters that would have a direct and predictable effect on his remaining financial interests. He would also abide by federal rules requiring impartiality in particular matters involving specific parties,\" Gorelick said in a statement. Kushner's wife, Ivanka Trump , is expected to move with him to Washington, D.C. Her role, if any, in the White House remains unclear. \"If you look at Ivanka, take a look at \u2014 she is so strong into the women's issue, child care and so many things, she would be so good. Nobody could do better than her, and I just have to see whether or not we can do that,\" Trump told \"Fox News Sunday\" last month. \"I would love to have Jared helping us with deals with other nations and see if we can do peace in the Middle East and other things. He's very talented,\" Donald Trump said. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Stephen Bannon and Jared Kushner disembark President-elect Donald Trump's plane as they make their way to Carrier Corporation in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Dec. 1, 2016. Kushner's expected appointment as a senior adviser \u2014 a role that does not require Senate confirmation \u2014 would raise a number of legal and ethical questions, given his family ties to the president-elect. The expected move would occur in what ethics experts describe as a legal gray area in the federal anti-nepotism statute. That law forbids appointment of family members to federal agencies, but some legal analysts see wiggle room, saying the White House may not be considered a government agency.

    "text": "No, Justice Ginsburg Hasn't Said She's Resigning Because Trump Won By RYAN STRUYK Jan 9, 2017, 11:22 AM ET 0 Shares Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post via Getty Images Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in Washington, Aug. 30, 2013. 0 Shares Email It's been making the rounds on Facebook, but it's not true: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has not said she's stepping down now because Donald Trump won the election. The story appeared on a website called \"Success Street\" on Dec. 22 -- trumpeting the headline \"Breaking News: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is RESIGNING From The Post of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court!!!!\" And while the first quote in the story matches an accurate quote in a story from The Associated Press on July 8, the other quotes in the story -- including a quote that reads \"I will resign my position as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States if that happens\" -- are completely false. ABC News reached out to Success Street via email and its Facebook page looking for answers. They didn't respond. But here's what we know about what Ginsburg actually did say about Donald Trump and the election -- and where this fake news story originated. What Ginsburg Actually Said Justice Ginsburg did a series of interviews before the Republican and Democratic conventions last summer during which she bashed Trump as a \"faker\" and said she couldn't imagine the country with the real estate mogul in the White House. \"I don't want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs,\" she told the AP on July 8. This quote appears at the top of the fake news story. Later that week, she told The New York Times: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this place would be -- I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be -- with Donald Trump as our president.\" Another actual quote: \u201cFor the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be -- I don\u2019t even want to contemplate that.\u201d And the next day, she called him a \"faker\" to CNN. \"He is a faker,\" she said. \"He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.\" On Twitter later that day, Trump called on her to resign. Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2016 She came under fire for her Trump comments and later apologized, saying in a statement that they were \"ill-advised\" and \"I regret making them.\" In fact, Ginsburg told NPR in October that she doesn't plan to retire anytime soon. \"I will retire when it's time,\" Ginsburg said. \"And, when is it time? When I can't do the job full-steam.\" The Supreme Court's public information office declined to comment for this story. The Origins of This Fake News Story The text of this fake news story seems to have appeared for the first time on July 8 -- which is why the fake news story's line about how \"the Supreme Court is in recess for the summer\" seems so out of place. On July 8, the same day as the first AP story was published, the fake news article appeared on a website called \"TheRightists.com.\" The Facebook \"like\" counter on the bottom of the page shows more than 81,000 likes. Neither the organization's Facebook page nor an email account associated with the page replied to requests for comment from ABC News. The next day, the fake story was billed as a \"PRNTLY\" exclusive by Connor Balough on its site. The Washington Post covered \"Prntly\" in depth in April. When I asked Alexander Portelli, the \"CEO of Prntly,\" whether he was the author of the story via Facebook, he asked, \"Does it look like I have time to write stories?\" and blocked me. The fake story currently making the rounds on Facebook has a new headline -- \"Breaking News: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is RESIGNING From The Post of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court!!!!\" -- but contains the exact same text, adding one new sentence at the top that falsely claims \"she will be resigning.\" ABC News has launched \"The Real News About Fake News\" powered by Facebook data in which users report questionable stories and misinformation circulating on the platform. The stories will undergo rigorous reporting to determine if the claims made are false, exaggerated or out of context. Stories that editorial partners have also debunked will then appear flagged in your News Feed. Editor\u2019s note: An earlier version of the story included misspellings of the name of Justice Ginsburg. 0 Shares ",

But at the main docks in Bremerhaven, in northern Germany, that\u2019s no longer the case. In fact, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports, quite the reverse is the order of the day. All the massive hardware of a U.S. combat brigade arrived in Germany over the weekend , and started rolling east toward Poland, where 4,000 American soldiers will be waiting for it. It is the first build-up of American troops and weapons in Europe in almost 30 years, and as Palmer reports, the impressive display of military might is meant, in large part, to reassure America\u2019s nervous allies in Europe that the U.S. military will be there, standing with them, against any Russian aggression. Aggression, and land grabs, like the 2014 invasion of Crimea, when Russian troops landed in what had been Ukraine and seized the ground for the Kremlin. America\u2019s response, manifested with the new deployment, has been to increase both its own force in Europe, and its support of NATO. ",

DeMille Award acceptance speech on Sunday's Golden Globe Awards to slam Donald Trump , celebrities, political commentators and even the president-elect took to Twitter to respond. Trump mocked Streep this morning as \"one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood\" and a Hillary Clinton \"flunky who lost big.\" Politics, Diversity Major Topics of Jokes and Speeches at 2017 Golden Globes Though the three-time Oscar winner never mentioned the president-elect by name during her speech, she did refer to a moment when a \"person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country\" gave an impression of a disabled reporter. Trump has said he never mocked New York Times reporter Serge F. Kovaleski's disability. He has a congenital disorder. \"Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence,\" Streep said. \"And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.\" Streep noted the diversity in the room, saying, \"Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners,\" and encouraged the entertainment community to support freedom of the press. One of the first to criticize the speech was Meghan McCain , a Fox News personality and the daughter of Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. This Meryl Streep speech is why Trump won. And if people in Hollywood don't start recognizing why and how - you will help him get re-elected \u2014 Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) January 9, 2017 Her tweet drew the attention of comedian Billy Eichner. \"Um she asked him not to make fun of disabled people and advocated for the freedom of the press and the arts,\" the star of \"Billy on the Street\" tweeted to McCain, referring to her with an expletive. McCain, who was critical of Trump during the presidential campaign, fired back that using expletives to refer to Republicans like her \"is a great way for Hollywood to bridge the cultural divide. Enjoy your bubble.\" \"I rather live in a bubble than live with people who don't feel a need to respect the disabled, freedom of speech & the arts!!\" Eichner shot back. Later he took Trump to task for focusing on Streep instead of U.S. intelligence agencies and other more pressing issues. Eichner was joined by other celebrities who praised and defended Streep's speech. I HAVE NEVER LOVED MERYL MORE. BRAVO.

Here's a look back at the tenure of Barack Obama, from Obamacare, his signature legislative achievement, to the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the Sept. 11 attacks, to a presidential visit to Cuba, the first in nearly 90 years.

Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton, 42, was shot by the suspect, Markeith Damengzlo Loyd, 41, after she responded to a sighting of him outside a Walmart store about 7:15 a.m. ET Monday, Police Chief John Mina told reporters. Clayton returned fire, but authorities don't believe Loyd was struck. Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton volunteering at Parramore Kidz Zone, an Orlando youth program, in an undated photo. Orlando Police Department Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, an 11-year veteran, was killed in a crash as authorities gave pursuit. Mina said at a somber news conference that Loyd could face charges of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer. \"We're going to bring this dirtbag to justice, and he's going to go to jail,\" Mina said. Clayton, who was married with a college-age son, was a 17-year veteran of the force who grew up in the area. Police records show that she was among the early wave of officers who responded to the shootings that killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12. OPD @ChiefJohnMina It is with such a heavy heart that I have to tell you Master Sgt Debra Clayton a 17-year veteran of OPD, died at 7:40 am pic.twitter.com/owWHyuaOtj \u2014 Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 9, 2017 Mayor Buddy Dyer, lamenting what he called \"an incredibly difficult day for Orlando,\" promised: \"We will catch this criminal, and we will bring him to justice.\" Orange County sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis in an undated photo. Orange County Sheriff's Office Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said the suspect carjacked a vehicle and fired at least one shot during a high-speed chase. During the pursuit, Lewis, who was on a motorcycle, was killed in a crash with an uninvolved motorist, Demings said. Lewis earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from the University of Central Florida in Orlando, where he played on the offensive line for the football team from 2000 to 2003. Authorities had been seeking Loyd since Dec. 13, when Sade Dixon, 24, a mother of two who was three months pregnant, was shot to death. Her brother was shot in the leg, police said.

Markeith Damengzlo Loyd in an undated photo. Orange County Sheriff's Office Authorities described Loyd as being 6 feet, 3 inches tall and weighing 230 pounds. They said he should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. State records show that Loyd has a long record of previous arrests, including a conviction for battery of a law enforcement officer and resisting an officer with violence in a Jan. 3, 1998, incident. He served just more than four years in prison, parole records show. His record includes other convictions for firearms violations and resisting police. He and his wife were in the process of divorcing after domestic violence charges against Loyd were dropped in late 2015. Dyer, the mayor, declared Monday an official day of mourning. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he was \"heartbroken and angered.\" Elizabeth Chuck ",

A 27-year-old woman from one of the mountain towns surrounding Wilkes-Barre was found dead in her family home. Lisman suspected a drug overdose. She was young. She had been healthy. There were no obvious signs of trauma. And heroin abuse had been on the rise in recent years. William Lisman, the Luzerne County Coroner, stands at the county morgue in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. NBC News \"When a person dies of an overdose, the lungs fill with fluid,\" he said. \"The victims essentially drown in their own fluids.\" Because autopsies are expensive and time consuming, many coroners faced with cases like these do toxicological tests designed to pick up traces of known drugs to determine the cause of death. But the first test Lisman administered came back negative. So did the second. So Lisman listed the cause of death as undetermined. Several days later, a 34-year-old man was found dead in a sleeping bag in the nearby city of Hazleton. Once again, Lisman suspected a fatal drug overdose. Once again, the tox tests came back negative. And once again, he listed the cause of death as undetermined. \"I remember when it started because it was budget time and they were about to cut my budget,\" he said, with a wry chuckle. \"At that point the doctor I had been consulting with (about these two cases) told me, 'Bill, there is something going on here'.\" Like many coroners in smaller counties, Lisman is not a doctor. But he knows about death. A third-generation Wilkes-Barre resident, he and his family ran a funeral home that buried several generations of city residents. He reached out to fellow coroners in neighboring counties to see if they had similar cases. They had. And the answer was fentanyl, a powerful painkiller the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says is 25 to 50 times more potent than heroin, packs 50 to 100 times more punch than morphine, and can be manufactured easily by illegal drug mills. This was the same drug that killed Prince last April. \"I started hearing about fentanyl and how drug dealers were cutting heroin with it,\" he said. Lisman said he had the toxicological tests \"tweaked\" to detect the presence of fentanyl and \"after that, the drug overdoses here skyrocketed.\" Facing a crisis, Lisman called the local newspaper, The Times Leader , last May and sounded the alarm. \"I knew I wasn't going to stop people from using, but I wanted people to know what they were using,\" he said. \"This stuff can kill them.\" And it has. The deadly math in Wilkes-Barre Last year there were 137 fatal drug overdoses \u2014 more than half of them the result of heroin laced with fentanyl \u2014 in a county of just 318,000 people. That death rate is four times higher than New York City. \"Twenty years ago, we might have 12 deaths we determined to be drug deaths,\" Lisman said. \"This year we are on track for 150 deaths\u2026By our standards, it's off the charts.\" There have been so many fatal drug overdoses that Lisman, who uses an examination room in the basement of a local hospital to do autopsies, said he has had to \"finagle space to put all the bodies.\" \"I have only room for two in my cooler,\" he said. \"There's room for just 10 more in the hospital's other cooler.\" The victims reflect the demographics of the county \u2014 they're mostly white, often lower to middle income, Lisman said. \"Age wise, we are across the spectrum, from 20s to the 70s,\" he said. \"We see everyone from the guy in the flophouse to the hard-working guys or gals who find relief in drugs.\" Also, while heroin users in the past relied on needles, \"the vast majority now is being snorted,\" said Lisman. \"A user doesn't have to go through the process of injecting now. It makes it easier to use.\" A big part of the reason Wilkes-Barre is grappling with a drug problem, Lisman said, is because this city of 41,000 is just a two hour drive from Philadelphia and from New York City. Interstates 80 and 81 converge just south of the city. A packet of heroin that sells for $5 in the Bronx can fetch double that in Wilkes-Barre, Lisman said. And if it's cut with fentanyl, the profit quadruples along with the danger to the users. \"Heroin definitely has its hold on this area,\" said Cathy Ryzner, a certified recovery specialist at the Wyoming Valley Alcohol & Drug Services in Wilkes-Barre. \"I've never seen anything like it. Every time you look in the newspaper and you see somebody died young and at home, you know. You know.\" Patty and Chris Emmett lost their son, Christopher, to an accidental opiate overdose on Aug. 23, 2016. NBC News Christopher Emmett buried his 23-year-old son, Christopher Jr., in August, although in his case it was due to a lethal mixture of morphine and codeine. \"Every time I hear of somebody dying it's always with the fentanyl mixed with it \u2014 it's never somebody that just did heroin and died from doing heroin,\" he said. From boom town to boarded-up storefronts The plague hit Wilkes-Barre as the proud county seat on the Susquehanna River was struggling to reverse decades of decay. Once a thriving city of 80,000, Wilkes-Barre was built by coal and manufacturing barons who erected stately homes and public edifices like the stunning Luzerne County Court House and the 14-story Luzerne National Bank Building in Public Square. Thousands of Italian, Polish, Lithuanian and Irish immigrants poured into the city to work in the mines and toil in the garment factories. But the city lost half its population when the anthracite coal mines died in the 1950s and the good manufacturing jobs began vanishing. And in 1972, Hurricane Agnes delivered a body blow to the local economy when it flooded downtown with nine feet of water. After that, Wilkes-Barre became a city of abandoned buildings and boarded-up store fronts as the remaining residents struggled to find their footing in an economy where the main employers were now government agencies, the local colleges and hospitals. The recession in 2008 hit Wilkes-Barre \u2014 long a Democratic bastion \u2014 hard. And when Barack Obama was running for president, hopeful residents voted for him in droves and did so again when he ran for reelection in 2012. But while the rest of the country rebounded, this Rust Belt city and the rest of the county, including Vice President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, across the border in Lackawanna County, were slow to recover. Many jobs returned, but not many were the good-paying kind that could support a middle-class life. And those who opted to stay in Wilkes-Barre became disappointed and resentful. \"They want the jobs they had before, not the jobs that are available now,\" said Kathy Bozinski, the marketing and communications chief at the United Way of Wyoming Valley. \"A lot of good things happened during the Obama Administration, but a lot of the things the folks here were hoping for just didn't happen.\" In November, Luzerne County voted for Donald Trump instead of Hillary Clinton, handing the Republican a narrow but shocking victory that helped propel him to the White House. \"I hate to use the clich\u00e9, but there are a lot of angry white guys in the region who 20 years ago were making decent money,\" Bozinski said. \"Now they are struggling to pay the mortgage and have a good life. There is a lot of frustration.\" Mary Wallace, who is Lisman's office administrator, said for many people leaving Wilkes-Barre for a better life somewhere else is not an option. \"It's hard for people who have been here for generations, whose families are buried here, to pick up and move even if they might be better off somewhere else,\" she said. \"This is their home.\" The most unhappy place in the United States Two years ago, a pair of researchers \u2014 one from Harvard, the other from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada \u2014 concluded that the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre metro area was the most unhappy place in the U.S. They reached their conclusion after wading through the results of telephone polls conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2005 and 2009, including answers to the question, \"How satisfied are you with your life?\" Lisman, whose four grown children did not return to the Wilkes-Barre area after finishing college, agreed that they live in a depressed community. \"We have a lot of people who are unhappy with life,\" he said. \"People using drugs are looking to escape.\" For Lisman, the heroin plague \"is a symptom of the way people here feel and have felt for years.\" \"I don't have an answer for opiate addiction,\" he said, his smile fading fast. \"The pain and suffering that it has caused is unbelievable. It is eating away at the core of society.\" Ryzner said the people she sees are dealing with a host of demons beyond the economic, everything from sexual abuse and broken homes to being raised in households where drinking and drug-taking runs rampant. She's seen people who get hooked on prescription drugs make the move to heroin. \"But I can't just blame the doctors,\" she said. \"It's a little bit of economics, little bit of hardship, little bit of being raised like that.\" Drugs like heroin, she said, \"makes all your problems melt away.\" \"It masks any kind of hurt, any kind of feeling\u2026after three days of doing opiates you are addicted,\" she said. \"You don't even know you're getting caught up.\" And Ryzner would know. She was a drug addict for three decades and has been clean for 10 years. Cathy Ryzner is a former addict and is currently a Certified Recovery Specialist with Wyoming Valley Alcohol and Drug Services, Inc. NBC News Death by drug overdose 'just not natural' It was against this backdrop that the heroin plague hit the region. Coroner Lisman, whose dad was once the mayor of Wilkes-Barre, said that at first he made a point of personally going to the scenes when a suspected fatal overdose was reported. No more. \"Now it's become so routine,\" said Lisman, who has gone back to dispatching his deputies to do the grim work of taking the bodies to the morgue. But Lisman said he is very much aware of what this plague is doing to his hometown and admits it has left him shaken. \"I was raised in an apartment above a funeral home ... death never scared me,\" he said. What bothers him, he said, is the resignation he has seen in the victims' families ones who react \"almost with relief.\" \"It bothers me that somebody's life could reach a point that death could be a positive thing,\" he said. This from a man who has comforted thousands of people over the years whose loved ones died of natural causes, sometimes after enduring years of pain. \"Death by drug overdose is different,\" he said. \"That's just not natural.\" One case in particular still haunts him. The police had gotten a 911 call and arrived to find a young couple in their 30s dead in bed from \"a hot load of heroin while their 5-year-old son was watching TV and eating Cheerios,\" Lisman said. \"He knew enough to call the police for help.\" Death behind closed doors The heroin plague in Wilkes-Barre is largely hidden with death taking drug abusers behind closed doors. \"You don't see junkies on the street,\" said Bozinski, who was previously an Emmy Award-winning TV and radio reporter. \"This happens behind closed doors. In bedrooms and basements.\" But the effects ripple across the city and touch everyone. \"Everywhere you go you hear, 'Did you see the story about that one in the paper? Was that another drug overdose?\" said Wallace. \"That's what everyone here is talking about.\" The toll is not just psychic. Crime is up, police report, especially petty thefts and break-ins by drug abusers looking for money to score a fix. And the dealers are almost always out-of-towners. \"They're not racist,\" Bozinski said of Wilkes-Barre's residents. \"Yes, some white guys blame people from outside for bringing drugs here. But there's also the acknowledgement that there is a market for it here.\" What's happening now in Wilkes-Barre is not new. Heroin use has been on the rise across the country since 2002, according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . \"We're behind the times,\" said 42-year-old Paul Smith, who was born and raised in the city \u2014 and who buried his former partner Jeremy three weeks earlier after he died of a heroin overdose. \"A lot of the problems that were happening in other places are now happening here.\" Sitting in a local bar called Hun's Caf\u00e9 99 and nursing a beer and a basket of chicken wings, Smith said Jeremy didn't know what he was dealing with when he started snorting heroin. \"It's been a very hard thing,\" he said. \"I spent a lot of time helping him to get clean. It was a very hard reality. And it was very hard to find services to help him.\" Smith said people in Wilkes-Barre turn to drugs because they are already depressed about their lives, depressed that they have to work two or three jobs to get by. \"That's why people went for Trump,\" said Smith, who runs a limo service, owns real estate \u2014 and admits to voting for the Manhattan mogul as well. \"People are so sick of other people doing better.\" Sitting beside Smith was 28-year-old John Sabatelli. He agreed that it was ignorance of dangerous new variety of heroin that was fueling the crisis. He recalled being surprised when he discovered that a couple at the warehouse where he works was getting high on heroin in the bathroom. \"It's surprising in that you don't know who is going to do it,\" he said. Grieving dad Christopher Emmett said drugs have got a death grip on his community. He said his doomed son started smoking pot at age 13 and quickly graduated to harder drugs. He said Christopher Jr. was in and out of rehab \u2014 and so were most of his friends. \"It is really an epidemic,\" Emmett said. \"We went to 14 funerals of my son's friends who died of addiction in just one year. They're dropping like flies, every day.\" Emmett's wife, Patricia, burst into tears at the thought of spending Christmas without her son. And as she cried, her boy's ashes sat in an urn on a shelf in the living room. \"There ain't no Christmas,\" she said, bitterly. A proud town fights on Wilkes-Barre may be down now but it is far from defeated. In Public Square, new restaurants like Franklin's have opened to serve the young professionals who have moved downtown to live in loft apartments in some of the vintage buildings. Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. NBC News Older establishments like the Caf\u00e9 Toscana were bustling with diners on a Tuesday night. And so was the brand new Chick-fil-A, which is located on the first floor of a dorm that King's College built right on the square in an attempt to make students part of the city's revival. Just outside downtown loomed the rotting hulks of long-abandoned factories. But higher up in the hills, Christmas lights twinkled on many of the modest-but-clearly kept up homes and the streets bustled with families going about the business of everyday life. Over at the ornate county courthouse, which dates back to 1909 and which was built at a time when the future of Wilkes-Barre seemed bright, a chorus of fourth graders from a school across the river in Larksville filed into the central hall to perform a medley of Christmas carols. Watching them was the grandmother of one 11-year-old, a chubby, brown-haired boy with untied gym shoes. His face creased into an angelic smile when he spotted his grandma. \"I am scared for him,\" said the grandmother, who declined to give her name. \"I have family that got hooked on drugs. I don't want that to happen to him.\" Asked why the area has been so ravaged by drugs, she shook her head. \"I don't know, maybe because they're so easy to get,\" she said. The children's music teacher, Joseph James, said so far his kids \"are completely sheltered\" from the heroin crisis unfolding around them. \"I hope it stays that way,\" he said. Corky Siemaszko ",

    "text": "Got it By John Wagner and Ashley Parker January 9 at 5:53 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Jared Kushner is President-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law but he's also one of his key confidants. Here's a closer look at the man who is expected to be a senior adviser to the president in Trump's White House. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump and one of his closest confidants, will join the White House as a senior adviser to the president, Trump announced Monday, while a lawyer assisting the family said that Kushner's wife, Ivanka Trump, will not immediately take on a formal role. Kushner, who will not take a salary, is expected to have a broad portfolio that includes government operations, trade deals and Middle East policy, according to a member of Trump's transition team. In a statement, the transition office said Kushner would work closely with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon to execute Trump\u2019s agenda. Trump relied heavily on Kushner's advice during the campaign, and his move to the White House was expected. But ethics experts have raised questions about whether Kushner's role in the new administration will run up against a federal anti-nepotism law and about how he will separate himself from his real estate business to avoid conflicts of interest. Kushner\u2019s attorney, WilmerHale partner Jamie Gorelick, said in an interview Monday that Kushner is prepared to resign from his business and divest substantial assets, including foreign investments, before\u00a0taking a White House position. Gorelick said she is confident that the anti-nepotism statute does not cover Trump's appointment of Kushner, though she acknowledged that some lawyers take the opposite view. Ivanka Trump plans to resign from the Trump Organization and step away from her clothing company but will focus \u2014 at least in the short term \u2014 on settling the family into its new home in Washington, a lawyer working with the family said. Kushner, 35, has run his family\u2019s multibillion-dollar business over the past decade, after his father pleaded guilty to corruption-related charges. As Donald Trump campaigned for president, Kushner played a key role, acting as an adviser and gatekeeper. Kushner, whose family has donated to causes in Israel, including West Bank settlements that have been branded illegal by the United Nations, also played a role as a Middle East policy adviser. \"Jared has been a tremendous asset and trusted adviser throughout the campaign and transition and I am proud to have him in a key leadership role in my administration,\" Trump said in a statement. [ Trump\u2019s son-in-law poised to resign as CEO of real estate company ] Some ethics experts question whether a Kushner's appointment would violate the 1967\u00a0federal anti-nepotism statute, which came about after President John F. Kennedy named his brother as attorney general. It forbids public officials from hiring family members in agencies or offices they oversee, and explicitly lists sons-in-law as prohibited employees. Richard Painter and Norman Eisen, who served as chief White House ethics lawyers under Presidents George W. Bush and Obama, respectively, say they counseled senior White House officials to avoid appointing relatives to West Wing jobs. But Gorelick said she is confident that the 1967 law does not apply to the White House, which she said is not an agency. \u201cThis is not a close question,\u201d Gorelick said, also citing subsequent law, passed in 1978, that she said allows the president to hire White House staffers \u201cwithout regard\u201d to federal personnel laws, including the anti-nepotism statute. \u201cThe Justice Department has described this authority as \u2018unfettered\u2019 and \u2018sweeping,\u2019 \u201d Gorelick added. Eisen said in an interview that \u201creasonable people may come to different views on this\u201d but that he believes Trump's appointment of Kushner could prompt \u201csome interesting litigation about whether [the 1967 law] applies or not.\u201d Someone who thinks they are negatively impacted by a Kushner decision could bring suit, Eisen said. On the other hand, \u201cpeople may not want to knock one of the more reasonable voices out of the White House,\u201d he said, referring to Kushner. The nepotism issue was examined but not fully resolved in a court case in the early 1990s involving Hillary Clinton\u2019s leadership of a health-care panel. Walter Dellinger, who served as acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton, said he thinks the law is on Trump's side, particularly given the 1978 law loosening restrictions on White House appointments. \"It makes good sense, because one should not assume Congress wants to interfere with whom the president wants as his closest advisers in the White House,\" Dellinger said. Kushner has a web of business interests, focused heavily on real estate development. Though Kushner\u2019s company is focused primarily on development in New York and New Jersey, it has often relied on foreign investment, and its earnings could be influenced by the Trump administration's trade and foreign-relations policies. Gorelick said that Kushner would resign as chief executive of the Kushner Cos. and as publisher of the New York Observer, divest all of his common stock and any foreign investments and shed many other assets. Many of Kushner's assets will be sold to his brother and a trust overseen by his mother, Gorelick said. Kushner will also recuse himself from matters that will have a direct impact on his remaining financial interests and abide by other federal ethics rules, according to Gorelick.

Now it looks like he may be taking an advisory role at the White House. USA TODAY NETWORK President-elect Donald Trump talks with son-in-law Jared Kushner during an election night party in New York. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) Asserting that anti-nepotism laws do not apply to the executive branch of government, President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump said Monday he\u00a0is appointing son-in-law Jared Kushner as a White House senior adviser. \u201cJared has been a tremendous asset and trusted adviser throughout the campaign and transition and I am proud to have him in a key leadership role in my administration,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cHe has been incredibly successful, in both business and now politics.\" While not mentioning that he is his son-in-law, Trump described Kushner as \"a\u00a0widely respected businessman and real estate developer was instrumental in formulating and executing the strategy behind President-elect Trump's historic victory in November.\" Calling the appointment an \"honor,\" Kushner said in a statement he is \"energized by the shared passion of the President-elect and the American people.\" Aides said the\u00a0husband of Ivanka Trump is working to wrap up his own business affairs in preparation for a move to Washington. Kushner \"is spending a lot of money on lawyers and compliance lawyers and has a real interest in bringing what has been tremendous business acumen and political instincts during the campaign into the White House as a senior adviser to his father-in-law the president,\" incoming presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway told USA TODAY. While federal law prevents public officials from appointing relatives \"to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction,\" Trump officials said that prohibition does not apply to presidents. Said Conway:\u00a0\u201cThe president has the right to appoint who he wants if you look at the law.\u201d Kushner will not take a salary, Trump said, but he will be a White House employee; that means he is subject to federal conflict of interest laws. Read more: Ethics office: Trump nominee hearings rushed Jamie Gorelick, an attorney representing Kushner, said he is \"committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take.\" While the details of his White House appointment are still being worked out, Gorelick said Trump's son-in-law would resign from Kushner Companies and divest his \"substantial assets\" in compliance with federal law. \"He would recuse from particular matters that would have a direct and predictable effect on his remaining financial interests,\" said Gorelick, a deputy attorney general for President Clinton who is now\u00a0partner at the WilmerHale law firm and chairman of its Regulatory and Government Affairs Department. \"He would also abide by federal rules requiring impartiality in particular matters involving specific parties.\" Kushner, who turns 36 years old this week, has served as a close adviser to Trump, both before and after his victory. When Trump visited the White House two days after the election to meet with President Obama, Kushner accompanied him and spoke with outgoing White House chief of staff Denis McDonough. Relatives have worked in previous presidential administrations. President Woodrow Wilson's first secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, became his son-in-law during that administration. John Eisenhower, son of President Dwight Eisenhower, worked for a top White House aide. Perhaps most famously, President John Kennedy made brother Robert Kennedy his attorney general. In 1967, however, Congress passed a law banning employment of relatives:\u00a0\"A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official.\" Trump aides cited legal rulings saying Congress cannot apply that law to executive branch appointments, including a case involving Hillary Clinton's work as chair of a health care task force created by President Bill Clinton. Members of a judicial panel in that case\u00a0pointed out that, whole a section of the law did cited \"executive agency\" as well as the Cabinet, \"we doubt that\u00a0Congress intended to include the White House or the\u00a0Executive Office of the President.\" Richard Painter, a chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said that on its face the law applies to all officials, including presidents. But Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, also said that \"a good argument could be made the other way.\" Said Painter: \"The upshot is it's unclear.\" Posted!

By David Weigel January 9 at 6:50 PM Follow daveweigel On Sunday, Democrats looked to have a handle on a busy week of Congress. They\u2019d scrambled across talk shows, making cases against president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees. They\u2019d prepped legislation to demand more financial disclosure from the president and his family. They\u2019d planned a series of press conferences to \u201cfight Republican efforts to gut Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d On Monday morning, they turned on their TVs to see coverage of Trump\u2019s social media brawl with Meryl Streep. Days before he takes office, Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 continue to wrestle with the president-elect\u2019s ability to command and reshape news cycles to his liking. His use of Twitter and strategic call-ins to reporters and TV shows, which bear no resemblance to past presidents\u2019 communication strategy, have hardly changed since the election. The traditional Washington ways of messaging have not changed either. Members of Congress speak from the floor to largely empty press galleries. They gather in TV studios, where few networks cut in to cover them. They respond to tweets with wordy press releases, columns, or open letters, each one staff-edited to down the last period after the last talking point. And they hold press stunts that worked before Trump came to town. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday, for instance, that Democrats would \u201chold the floor late into the night\u201d to protest the Obamacare repeal push with cameras rolling. Less clear was whether anyone would be watching. [ Senate Democrats try to re-create House sit-in buzz in Obamacare protest ] \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s been extremely effective at setting a tone, from the campaign through the transition,\u201d said Anita Dunn, a former communications director in the Obama White House who\u2019s now managing director at the messaging firm SKDKnickerbocker. \u201cThis idea that somehow you have to sound \u2018senatorial\u2019 when you get to Washington should be laid to rest. People should sound like themselves. When they don\u2019t, they\u2019re feeding into how Trump is able to run against Washington.\u201d Since Trump\u2019s surprise victory, Democrats have beefed up the Democratic National Committee\u2019s \u201cwar room,\u201d and given official roles in party messaging to higher-profile senators like Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The first week of the 115th contest looked to validate those changes, as Republicans stumbled over an attempt to change House ethics rules and struggled to conjure a coherent replacement for the Affordable Care Act. But at times, both parties looked to be reacting not to their plans, but to Trump\u2019s whims. The roll-out of Democrats\u2019 messaging on the Affordable Care Act included the imperfect image of senators standing next to a sign that read \u201cMake America Sick Again.\u201d Schumer spent part of one day rebutting Trump\u2019s description of Democrats as \u201cSchumer clowns,\u201d shared \u2014 naturally \u2014 on Twitter. \u201cI think the Republicans should stop clowning around with people\u2019s Medicare, Medicaid, and health care,\u201d Schumer responded. [ How a week of Trump tweets stoked anxiety, moved markets and altered plans ] That gibe evoked some of the Trump rebuttals that had fallen flat in 2016, from Hillary Clinton\u2019s brief description of \u201cTrumped-up trickle down\u201d economics to Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) branding his running mate as \u201ca you\u2019re hired president, not a you\u2019re fired president.\u201d George Lakoff, a cognitive linguist who ten years ago advised Democrats on how to reframe political debates, said that too much of their current rhetoric fits into Trump\u2019s ideal image, as a \u201cstrict father\u201d who takes on all comers. \u201cDemocrats are fixated on the wise guy response, on turning their words against them,\u201d said Lakoff. \u201cThe problem is that it doesn\u2019t work. What does Rachel Maddow do every night? \u2018Look at this outrageous thing; now, look at this outrageous thing five more times.\u2019 Trump knows this is going to happen if he does certain things. When you say Make America Sick Again, you don\u2019t score a point \u2014 you activate his slogan, which is physically branded in the brain.\u201d The current messaging rankles on the left, where Democrats are seen as too bound to their scripts to face Trump on his own terms. Alan Grayson, a former Florida congressman whose bluntness made him one of the party\u2019s best fundraisers, had accused Republicans of prefering Americans \u201cdie quickly\u201d than get expanded coverage. (Opposed by national Democrats, he lost a Senate primary in 2016.) \u201cThe fundamental problem is not just what we\u2019re promising, but the lack of credibility in what we promise,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cTrump would say \u2018I\u2019ll make the Mexicans pay for the wall.\u2019 People said, \u2018oh my god,\u2019 but they didn\u2019t laugh at it. Let\u2019s say Scott Walker said the same thing, with the words in the same places. Nobody would believe him. Democrats have the same problem, and it\u2019s pervasive through elite political culture.\u201d Felix Biederman, the co-host of the Chapo Trap House podcast, sometimes affects a \u201cDemocrat voice\u201d to mimic the sing-song recitation of talking points or canned lines. \u201cTrump remembers a key rule, which is that politics is the execution of power and an answer to the question who gets what,\u201d Biederman said. \u201cWhen Democrats say \u2018Make America Sick Again\u2019 or \u2018Love Trumps Hate,\u2019 they\u2019re saying the best thing they can come up with is it to fight Trumpism on the linguistic grounds of Trump\u2019s choosing.\u201d There are efforts underway to change that. Next Sunday, Democrats in the House and Senate are organizing rallies under the theme \u201cOur First Stand,\u201d gathering activists to oppose any Republican effort to cut back health care spending. It\u2019s the earliest that an opposition party has participated in protests against an incoming president. Part of the idea, said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), is to inform activists that they can get active in ways that do not break through the media narrative, Trump tweet or no tweet. \u201cFor Democrats and Republicans, a lot of life is raising money for TV ads and making sure that the media show up to a press conference,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do more that. If thousands up people show up to a rally, and there\u2019s no media there, those people still go home with the knowledge that they\u2019re part of a struggle.\u201d And some Democrats have acknowledged that they need to take more risks with how they speak in public \u2014 bringing it more line with how they think, and less how politicians tend to talk. On Monday, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Ct.) tweeted a link from Talking Points Memo that quoted McConnell as promising a replacement for the Affordable Care Act \u201csoon,\u201d but not saying when. \u201cMcConnell\u2019s Dictionary (3rd ed.),\u201d wrote Murphy. \u201cSoon. Adverb. At no time in the past or future; not ever. Syn: never.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "CBS News January 9, 2017, 7:03 AM Lawmakers question rules allowing guns at airports Email Lawmakers are taking a new look at rules about guns on planes after Friday\u2019s airport shooting in Fort Lauderdale . Investigators say shooting suspect Esteban Santiago traveled from Alaska to Florida with the gun he used in the deadly rampage. The firearm was in his checked baggage. Part of the surprise of Friday\u2019s shooting is the fact Santiago arrived on an incoming flight -- and so did his gun. Last year the TSA reported confiscating more than 3,300 firearms from carry-on bags, but the agency allows guns in checked luggage, reports CBS News correspondent Tony Dokoupil. They have to be unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container, and owners have to declare them at the ticket counter. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to take a hard look once and for all at the unsecured areas of our airports,\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., said. Wasserman Schultz said she plans to review security procedures with TSA leaders. A TSA agent died in a shooting in 2013 outside a security checkpoint at Los Angeles International Airport. The rules regarding guns in airports vary by city and state. The National Council of State Legislatures has identified six states including Florida which ban people from carrying guns in all areas of airports. \u201cThe law is only protecting criminals. It\u2019s not protecting law-abiding citizens who want the right and ability to defend themselves,\u201d Republican Florida State Sen. Greg Steube said. Steube introduced a bill to allow owners with permits to openly carry guns in areas like the place where Friday\u2019s shooting occurred. He suggests the 45-second attack could have ended even sooner if other passengers were armed. \u201cThat\u2019s a ludicrous suggestion. If someone with a gun in the baggage claim area opened fire in the midst of hundreds of people, the life loss probably would have been worse,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said. Every year, police in New York City reportedly arrest dozens of people trying to check in for flights with guns in their bags. Many visitors don\u2019t realize it\u2019s illegal to possess a gun in New York City without a city permit. But gun owners in other cities routinely fly in and out without problems. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Twenty-one-year-old Malik Steffon Neal of Joliet made his first court appearance Monday in Cook County. Police say Neal was arrested Sunday after he entered a restricted area without a valid ticket and ignored police commands to stop. Neal allegedly struck several officers as they tried to arrest him. One Chicago officer was taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries to the face, and a Chicago sergeant was treated at the scene. Authorities say Neal was taken to Resurrection Medical Center for a mental health evaluation after he was arrested. It wasn't immediately known if Neal has legal representation. 0 Shares ",

Yet, a couple days before the Golden Globes, it was a photographer who seemed worthy of our focus. At just 8-years-old, Juanita Hernandez was getting lessons so she could take pictures at the big show. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity for a girl who was diagnosed with cancer when she was just 5. \"It's really painful. You, as a parent, don't want to hear from a doctor saying your kid's got cancer,\" Juanita's mother, Amanda Ardila, said of her daughter's diagnosis. Juanita Hernandez and actress Kerry Washington Juanita had to endure surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. What made things easier was a program that taught her photography. \"I used to think I would be, nobody would want to play with me because I had cancer, but then this program changed me and it changed my mind,\" Juanita told NBC News. The program is called Pablove Shutterbugs, named after Pablo Thrailkill Castelaz, who died of cancer at 6 years old. Through photography classes, the organization says young patients can express what they're going through. It certainly helped Juanita. With her cancer now in remission, she made her way to the Golden Globes Sunday night and made a statement of her own on the red carpet. And not did she take pictures of Hollywood's biggest stars \u2014 but with them. Juanita posed with the likes of Amy Adams, Goldie Hawn, and Kerry Washington at Hollywood's big event. Joe Fryer ",

(Jan. 9) AP President-elect Donald Trump listens to a reporter's question at Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 9, 2017. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) On Twitter, President-elect Donald Trump falsely wrote that a reporter \u201ctotally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad.\u201d As we have written before , the reporter never changed his story about the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Trump\u2019s tweet was in response to a speech given by actress Meryl Streep at the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 8. Streep, who supported Hillary Clinton for president, said that \u201cit kind of broke my heart\u201d when she saw \u201cthat moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter.\u201d She did not mention Trump by name. Trump tweeted that he \u201cnever \u2018mocked\u2019 a disabled reporter\u201d but did show him \u201cgroveling\u201d as he \u201ctotally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad.\u201d Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never \"mocked\" a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him....... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 \"groveling\" when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 Streep and Trump were both referring to New York Times investigative journalist Serge Kovaleski , a disabled reporter who suffers from arthrogryposis, which primarily restricts joint movement in the limbs. Kovaleski co-authored a story for The\u00a0Washington Post in 2001 that said \u201ca number of people\u201d in Jersey City, N.J., were \u201callegedly seen celebrating\u201d the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. During the Republican primary, Trump cited that story as evidence for his discredited claim that he saw on television \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people in New Jersey celebrate the terrorist attacks. Trump made his claim about the celebrations during a speech in Alabama on Nov. 21, 2015. Two days later, Trump tweeted a link to Kovaleski\u2019s Post article from Sept. 18, 2001, and demanded an apology from those who wrote that his statement was false. Via @washingtonpost 9/18/01. I want an apology! Many people have tweeted that I am right! https://t.co/CpsMxs54qv pic.twitter.com/wrDEhXJlvR \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 23, 2015 But as we have written , the Post never reported that there were \u201cthousands\u201d of people in New Jersey \u201ccelebrating\u201d the attacks, as Trump originally claimed. The story, written by Kovaleski and Fredrick Kunkle, said that \u201cIn Jersey City \u2026 law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.\u201d In interviews after Trump made his claim, Kovaleski and Kunkle both said that they couldn\u2019t recall if the allegations about the tailgate-style celebration were ever substantiated. In a CNN story published Nov. 24, 2015, Kovaleski was quoted saying that he and Kunkle \u201cdid a lot of shoe leather reporting in and around Jersey City and talked to a lot of residents and officials. \u2026 But I do not recall anyone saying there were thousands, or even hundreds, of people celebrating.\u201d And in an update to its story from Nov. 22, 2015, the Washington Post Fact Checker quoted Kunkle saying that he could never confirm the reports of celebrations. \u201cI specifically visited the Jersey City building and neighborhood where the celebrations were purported to have happened. But I could never verify that report,\u201d Kunkle told the Post. Then, during a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24, 2015, Trump, while making a jerking motion with his arms, paraphrased Kovaleski as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I said. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Many, including Streep, saw that as Trump imitating Kovaleski\u2019s disability, which Trump has denied he was doing. We don\u2019t know what Trump\u2019s intentions were, and readers can judge the video of Trump\u2019s remarks for themselves. But we can say that Trump is wrong to claim that Kovaleski \u201ctotally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad.\u201d Read more: Posted!

Marc Hamid, the former owner of a rooftop club across the street from Wrigley Field, was found guilty of underreporting attendance and revenue at Skybox on Sheffield. R. Marc Hamid, the former owner of a rooftop club across the street from Wrigley Field, was found guilty of underreporting attendance and revenue at Skybox on Sheffield. Jason Meisner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The onetime owner of a rooftop club overlooking Wrigley Field was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison Monday for hiding more than $1 million in revenue to avoid paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties owed to the Cubs as well as state and local taxes. R. Marc Hamid, 48, was convicted by a jury in July of nine counts of mail fraud and illegal bank structuring for falsifying attendance records at the Skybox on Sheffield, a rooftop club beyond the right field wall. In handing down the sentence, U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin said that as a lawyer and successful businessman, Hamid \"had no reason to go out and commit these crimes.\" But Durkin's sentence was well below the recommendations of prosecutors, who at one point had advocated up to about eight years behind bars. The judge said the amount of money involved paled in comparison to most fraud schemes charged in federal court and noted it was likely the Cubs' \"celebrity\" as a victim \"made this investigation so dogged.\" Before he was sentenced, Hamid, dressed in a dark suit and glasses, sobbed as he apologized to the Cubs as well as for the \"collateral damage\" he caused his family and friends. He described Wrigley Field as a \"very special place\" and partnering with the team as a dream opportunity that he squandered when he fell into financial difficulty. \"I betrayed the Cubs and that opportunity by defrauding them,\" said Hamid, pausing to dab at his eyes with a tissue. \"The day-to-day pressures blinded me to the reality of what I was doing.\" Hamid was found guilty of under-reporting attendance and revenue at Skybox on Sheffield from 2008 to 2011 through a variety of schemes, including \"zeroing out\" invoices and charging customers through one of his ticket brokerages, Just Great Seats and Just Great Tickets, instead of the rooftop business itself. The phony numbers meant the Cubs did not get as much in royalty payments as the 17 percent of gross annual revenues called for under terms of the rooftop owners' agreement with the team.

Kim / Chicago Tribune) According to prosecutors, Hamid then submitted false sales tax returns to the state of Illinois and amusement tax returns to Cook County and the city of Chicago for those years, failing to report about $1.5 million in sales. Hamid allegedly used some of the unreported money for personal and business expenses, including payments on luxury cars. Hamid's nine-day trial included the testimony of Skybox on Sheffield manager Richard Zasiebida, a former Oak Park cop who admitted on the witness stand that he pocketed cash at the door from fans who wanted a seat at the venue. The company's accountant, Joseph Gurdak, admitted he helped Hamid hide the funds from the team. Both Zasiebida and Gurdak have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. Prosecutors also presented evidence of the bad blood between the Cubs and rooftop owners, a tense situation that had escalated after the Ricketts family bought the team in 2009. In one email, when asked whether the latest revenue estimates should be sent to Cubs business President Crane Kenney or some other team executive, Hamid wrote back, \"Just write to (the) resident (expletive) and they can figure it out.\" ",

    "text": "Trump picks for attorney general, DHS kick off week of confirmation hearings Published               January 10, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees to lead the departments of Justice and Homeland Security will appear before Senate commitees Tuesday to kick off what is likely to be a contentious confirmation process. Late Monday, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., announced that he would testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee against the nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Booker will be joined by Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La. \u2014 the head of the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 as part of an effort by Democrats to portray Sessions as out of the mainstream on civil rights legislation. Booker is believed to be the first sitting Senator to testify in a confirmation hearing against another sitting senator nominated for a Cabinet position. \"I do not take lightly the decision to testify against a Senate colleague,\" Booker said in a statement. \"But the immense powers of the Attorney General combined with the deeply troubling views of this nominee is a call to conscience. \"The Attorney General is responsible for ensuring the fair administration of justice, and based on his record, I lack confidence that Senator Sessions can honor this duty,\" the senator added. Democrats don't have the power to block the nomination of either Sessions or retired Marine Gen. John Kelly to head DHS, since Republicans control the Senate and only need a simple majority to confirm both men.\u00a0 However, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are expected to try and paint Sessions as being out of the mainstream on issues critical to the party's core voters \u2014 Hispanics, African Americans and women \u2014 ahead of the 2018 election cycle. Sessions has been a leading advocate not only for cracking down on illegal immigration, but also for slowing all legal immigration, increasing mass deportations and giving more scrutiny to those entering the United States. He vehemently opposed the bipartisan immigration bill that the Senate passed in 2013 that included a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who worked with Republicans to craft the immigration legislation, indicated last week that he would have a hard time supporting Sessions, saying \"he has been more anti-immigration than just about any other single member of Congress.\" In 1986, Sessions was nominated to the federal bench by then-President Ronald Reagan, but was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations that he had called a black attorney \"boy\" \u2014 which he denied \u2014 and described the NAACP and ACLU as \"un-American.\" Last week, the NAACP staged a sit-in at one of Sessions' Alabama offices, and its legal defense fund said it was \"inconceivable that he should be entrusted with the oversight of our civil rights laws.\" Hank Sanders, a Democratic state senator in Alabama, points to cases Sessions pursued as a prosecutor against civil rights activists in the 1980s. \"They called them voter fraud cases,\" said Sanders, who won acquittals for the defendants. \"I called them voter persecution cases.\" However, Albert Turner Jr., the son of two of those defendants recently said he believed Sessions \"is not a racist\" and \"was simply doing his job\" when he prosecuted the cases. Supporters describe Sessions as a man of integrity who fought for desegregation during his career as a local GOP leader, prosecutor and elected official. As U.S. attorney, Sessions' office investigated and helped secure convictions in the 1981 Ku Klux Klan lynching of Michael Donald, a black teenager found hanging from a tree. Greg Griffin, a black Alabama judge who worked as a state attorney when Sessions was Alabama attorney general, told the Associated Press over the weekend that Sessions \"always treated me with respect\" and called him \"one of the best bosses I ever had.\" While in the Senate, Sessions voted to confirm Obama's first attorney general, Eric Holder, the first black man to lead the Justice Department. He also worked with Democratic colleagues on efforts to combat prison rape and to reduce federal sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses, saying the gap unfairly targeted the \"African-American community simply because that is where crack is most often used.\" Kelly, who is expected to be easily confirmed by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the full Senate, would be the first non-civilian to head DHS since the department was created in 2002. He is expected to be questioned closely about his views on border security. Trump famously vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico when he announced his run for president, and stuck to that vow throughout the campaign.

Or even to me,\u201d Piro said. \u00a0 Saddam was later tried and executed by hanging in December 2006. Santiago, the airport shooting suspect, also served in Iraq in 2010 with the Puerto Rico National Guard as part of an engineering battalion, guard officials said. Santiago later served in the Army Reserves and Alaska National Guard. After Iraq, Piro moved on to top FBI counterterrorism jobs in Washington, including a White House position involving high-value detainee interrogation that works with various intelligence agencies. Since taking the top Miami FBI job, Piro has overseen work in more domestic areas such as health care fraud, identity theft and tax fraud, Ponzi schemes and mortgage fraud - all areas where South Florida is among the nation\u2019s leaders. Bank robberies, violent street gangs, public corruption and smuggling of humans and drugs round out much of the work for the Miami office\u2019s roughly 1,000 agents and employees.

Rather than one giant impact that knocked off part of early Earth and created the moon, a number of smaller collisions may have produced lots of mini-moons, Israeli scientists reported Monday. Millions of people around the world are over the moon because of the supermoon. The moon is lighting up the sky, and it's the largest it has been... And those mini-moons, over millions of years, may have clumped together to make one large one. The researchers conducted nearly 1,000 computer simulations and estimate about 20 impacts could do the job. They say that would explain why the moon seems to be composed of material from Earth, rather than some other planet, too. It\u2019s actually an old theory revitalized now by the Weizmann Institute of Science\u2019s Raluca Rufu in Rehovot, Israel, and his team. Their findings were published in Nature Geoscience. \u201cOur model suggests that the ancient Earth once hosted a series of moons, each one formed from a different collision with the proto-Earth,\u201d said co-author Hagai Perets of the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. Rufu added in the same statement: \u201cIt\u2019s likely that small moons formed through the process could cross orbits, collide and merge.\u201d Small collisions like this were common in the early solar system , and support their premise. But a London scientist not associated with the study - Imperial College\u2019s Gareth Collins - is urging more evidence on both sides of the moon-forming argument. Some of the moonlets surely were lost in space or did not merge properly with what was to become today\u2019s moon, Collins said in a companion article, and so many more impacts may have been required. That, in turn, would make the multi-impact theory \u201cfar less probable than any of the more exotic single-impact scenarios,\u201d he wrote. Rufu and his colleagues agree more work is needed to understand how moonlets might indeed merge into one final moon. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

CEO Marissa Mayer announced she would resign from the company's board following the sale and the company could even get a new name. USA TODAY NETWORK In this Feb. 19, 2015, file photo, Yahoo President and CEO Marissa Mayer delivers the keynote address at the first-ever Yahoo Mobile Developer's Conference, in San Francisco. (Photo: Eric Risberg, AP) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, co-founder David Filo and others plan to resign from the company's board when it completes its $4.8 billion sale to Verizon. The high-profile Mayer, who was brought in to save the Internet icon in 2012; Filo, who co-founded the company at Stanford University in 1994;\u00a0board chairman Maynard Webb; and three others are departing. It is unclear, however, if Mayer will remain in some capacity. Eric Brandt, a new\u00a0member of Yahoo's 11-member board, was named chairman immediately. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing\u00a0late\u00a0today, Yahoo said the resignations are \"not due to any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company\u2019s operations, policies or practices.\" The filing also said the company would be renamed Altaba after\u00a0the Verizon deal closes. Meyers absence from the new company's board is not surprising at all, said Gil Luria,\u00a0managing director\u00a0for\u00a0equities research at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \u201cAltaba\u00a0will not be an operating company and\u00a0therefor\u00a0there is very little for her to be involved in,\u201d he said. Luria theorized that Altaba, whose value is mostly made up of Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba stake, will likely be unwound over time by selling the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes to investors. \u201cThe only consideration slowing that sale down would be tax consequences to shareholders who have seen the Alibaba stake appreciate considerably since Yahoo bought the stake,\u201d he said. SEC The Yahoo-Verizon deal has been star-crossed since it was announced in July 2016. Last week, a\u00a0senior\u00a0Verizon\u00a0executive who was instrumental in the telecom\u00a0company's planned purchase of Yahoo's Internet business expressed doubts over the deal, the second top exec to raise the specter of a changed or abandoned takeover. \"I can't sit here today and say with confidence one way or another because we still don't know,\" Marni Walden, president of product innovation and new businesses at Verizon, said when asked about determining whether the deal gets done.\u00a0She did, however, tell attendees at an investment bank conference in Las Vegas that the deal made sense. Not so fast, Yahoo is still alive and kicking Verizon execs have been unsettled by two disclosed digital breaches by Yahoo that have affected more than 1 billion of its members dating back several years. Yahoo has also struggled to land digital advertising in the face of withering competition from larger rivals Google and Facebook.

The deployment -- which also includes 3,500 U.S. Troops -- is to protect Eastern Europe against a potential Russian invasion. In the dock area of the German city of Bremerhaven all around is American military hardware just off the boat -- everything from Humvees to tanks.\u00a0 The official name for this display of military muscle is Operation Atlantic Resolve.\u00a0 Its purpose is to reassure America\u2019s nervous European allies that the U.S. military will stand with them against any aggressive moves by Russia. Moves, like the 2014 invasion of Crimea, when Russian troops arrived in what had been Ukraine -- and seized it for the Kremlin.\u00a0 The Hill's Jordan Fabian discusses Donald Trump's relationship with the intelligence community and the Russian election hack. America\u2019s response is a decision to stop the draw down of U.S. troops in Europe, and reverse it -- in the first buildup since the end of the Cold War. \u201cWe intend to reassure all those here in Europe that we are committed to peace and security, and to send a signal to anybody else who would differ with that, that that\u2019s not gonna work,\u201d said Lt. General Timothy Ray, deputy commander of the U.S.\u2019s European command. That anybody else would be Vladimir Putin, who is on record as saying its stupid and unrealistic to think that Russia would attack anyone.\u00a0 But just in case, Operation Atlantic Resolve is big and very visible deterrent. Over the next week all the equipment will leave Germany and be sent to Poland, and from there, be deployed across Eastern Europe.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

In an interview with Capital Download on Monday, Kellyanne Conway, one of Donald Trump's top advisers, dismissed the scathing critique of Trump by the legendary actress at the Golden Globes awards Sunday night. \"Look, Meryl Streep and that room she was in represents a small slice of America,\" Conway told USA TODAY's video newsmaker series. \"But this was an anti-elite (election). This was a rejection of the elites, of people in the political media, Hollywood, money access, frankly, that was out of touch with America. I mean, Donald Trump proved one thing, mightily: He understood America and he had a masterful way of communicating and connecting with them.\" There are entertainers who have a better sense of America, she went on. \"These are the same people having Storage Wars, and Duck Dynasty,\" Conway said. \"They know what resonates with America. And yet when you have a Hollywood awards show, it reverts back, I think, to a single mind and a certain myopia, when it comes to political discourse.\" That said, when asked she said she does have a favorite Streep performance. \"I'd have to say, Kramer Vs. Kramer,\" she said with a smile. \"I was 12 and I had come from a divorced set of parents. I really related to that movie and I thought she just gave a star-turn performance.\" Read more: Posted!

Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer is among six directors who plan to leave the board of the investment company that will be left after the closing of the proposed sale of Yahoo's main internet properties to Verizon Communications. The new company, a shareholder in Alibaba Group Holding and Yahoo! Japan, will change its name to Altaba and reduce its board to five members as it looks ahead to its next chapter with fewer ties to the iconic brand, according to a filing Monday. Yahoo agreed to sell its web properties to Verizon in a deal valued at about $4.8 billion, though questions have come up after Yahoo revealed two separate hacks of user data. The directors that will remain with Altaba after the closing of the Verizon sale are Tor Braham, Eric Brandt, Catherine Friedman, Thomas McInerney and Jeffrey Smith. The departing members also include Eddy Hartenstein, a director of Chicago Tribune owner tronc, as well as Maynard Webb, David Filo, Richard Hill and Jane Shaw. ",

    "text": "Jewish Centers in Several States Targeted With Bomb Threats By jennifer kay, associated press MIAMI BEACH, Fla. \u0097 Jan 9, 2017, 5:55 PM ET 0 Shares Email Bomb threats targeted Jewish community centers in at least six states Monday, and some were made with prerecorded telephone calls, according to an official with the Jewish Federations of North America. It's not clear why up to 20 Jewish community centers across the South and Northeast were targeted, said Richard Sandler, chair of the JFNA board of trustees. \"Some of the threats were robo-calls,\" said Sandler, adding that the number of threats was unusually high. No additional details about the calls were immediately available. Some community centers were evacuated but no explosives were found, Sandler said. Bomb threats also targeted Jewish community centers and schools in central Florida and Tampa last week, but Sandler said there was no apparent link between those threats and the calls received Monday. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman Amanda Hils said in an email that the agency was aware of the threats and its field divisions were ready to assist state and local law enforcement. Most of the centers have resumed normal operations, said David Posner, director of strategic performance at JCC Association of North America. The Maitland Jewish Community Campus was evacuated Monday for the second time in a week because of a bomb threat . The complex includes a school, community center, a Holocaust museum and the offices of the Jewish Federation of Greater Orlando. Bomb threats also were received at the Miami Beach Jewish Community Center and the Jewish Community Alliance of Jacksonville. A Miami-Dade Police bomb squad was dispatched to the Alper Jewish Community Center, where staff evacuated hundreds of children \"as an abundance of caution,\" said Miami-Dade Police Detective Alvaro Zabaleta. In Nashville, Tennessee, 225 people were evacuated from the Gordon Jewish Community Center and an adjacent school after a security guard received a bomb threat over the phone. Buildings were evacuated and authorities investigated similar threats in Atlanta; Tenafly, New Jersey ; Columbia, South Carolina; and Wilmington, Delaware. In Maryland, threats also were called into Jewish community centers in Baltimore and Rockville. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, Randall Chase in Wilmington, Delaware, Kasey Jones in Baltimore and Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Jan. 9, 2017, 4:42 p.m. New York Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is named a White House senior advisor Associated Press Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump, is shown with wife Ivanka (left) at the Hilton Midtown in New York. (Getty Images) President-elect Donald Trump appointed his influential son-in-law Jared Kushner as a White House senior advisor Monday, putting the young real estate executive in a position to exert broad sway over both domestic and foreign policy, particularly Middle East issues and trade negotiations. Trump has come to rely heavily on Kushner, who is married to the president-elect's daughter Ivanka. Since the election, the political novice has been one of the transition team's main liaisons to foreign governments, communicating with Israeli officials and meeting Sunday with Britain's foreign minister. He's also huddled with congressional leaders and helped interview Cabinet candidates. Ivanka Trump, who also played a significant role advising her father during the presidential campaign, will not be taking a formal White House position. Transition officials said the mother of three young children wanted to focus on moving her family from New York to Washington. Kushner's eligibility for the White House could be challenged, given a 1967 law meant to bar government officials from hiring relatives. Kushner lawyer Jamie Gorelick argued Monday that the law does not apply to the West Wing. She cited a later congressional measure to allow the president \"unfettered\" and \"sweeping\" authority in hiring staff. In a statement, Trump said Kushner will be an \"invaluable member of my team as I set and execute an ambitious agenda.\" Kushner will resign as CEO of his family's real estate company and as publisher of the New York Observer. He will also divest \"substantial assets,\" Gorelick said. The lawyer said Kushner would not be taking a salary. Ivanka Trump will also be leaving her executive roles at the Trump Organization \u2014 her father's real estate company \u2014 and her own fashion brands. Kushner, who turns 36 Tuesday, emerged as one of Trump's most powerful campaign advisors during his father-in-law's often unorthodox presidential bid \u2014 a calming presence in an otherwise chaotic campaign. Soft-spoken and press-shy, he was deeply involved in the campaign's digital efforts and was usually at Trump's side during the election's closing weeks. He has continued to be a commanding presence during the transition, working alongside incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior advisor Steve Bannon. He's played a key role in coordinating Trump's contacts with foreign leaders and has been talking with foreign government officials himself, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations.

By Missy Ryan and Steven Mufson January 9 at 11:32 AM Follow @missy_ryan Follow @StevenMufson When Ashti Hawrami, the oil minister from Iraq\u2019s largely autonomous Kurdistan region, unfurled a map of untapped oil fields for a team of ExxonMobil officials in the spring of 2011, they saw possibility and profit. The minister pointed to the blocks that had already been taken by other foreign firms as Iraqi Kurdistan, long at odds with the country\u2019s central government over oil and territory, raced to establish itself as a player on world oil markets. He also showed them the fields that were still up for grabs. Tell me what you want, and we can start negotiating, Hawrami said, according to one former Exxon official who attended the meeting. It was the start of months of hurried talks blessed by ExxonMobil\u2019s chief executive, Rex Tillerson, and other senior executives back in Dallas. The company was making a high-stakes gamble that new agreements would pay off handsomely if the northern region held billions of barrels of accessible oil. But the deal overseen by Tillerson, whose confirmation hearings to become secretary of state begin Wednesday, defied U.S. foreign policy aims, placing the company\u2019s financial interests above the American goal of creating a stable, cohesive Iraq. U.S. diplomats had asked Exxon and other firms to wait, fearing that such deals would undermine their credibility with Iraqi authorities and worsen ethnic tensions that had led Iraq to the brink of civil war. A law governing nationwide oil investments was tied up in parliament, and Iraqi officials were rejecting the Kurdistan regional government\u2019s authority to export oil or cut its own deals. When word of Exxon\u2019s partnership with the Kurds reached Washington, the State Department chided the oil firm: \u201cWhen Exxon has sought our advice about this, we asked them to wait for national legislation. We told them we thought that was the best course of action,\u201d then-spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said . Exxon\u2019s 2011 exploration deal with the Kurdistan region provides a window into how Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the State Department, has approached doing business in one of the world\u2019s most risky, complicated places, where giant energy deals can have far-reaching political effects. The episode of petro-diplomacy illustrates Exxon\u2019s willingness to blaze its own course in pursuit of corporate interests, even when it threatens to collide with U.S. foreign policy. When Iraq\u2019s central government threatened to throw Exxon out of much larger, established operations in the south, Tillerson personally intervened, using his executive clout to smooth things over with authorities in Baghdad while making clear his company would weather the political fallout in pursuit of its central goal: a profitable deal. \u201cIt\u2019s a big company that looks for ways to make money like all big companies,\u201d Philip H. Gordon, a former White House coordinator for Middle East policy, said of Exxon. He said the controversial Iraqi Kurdistan contracts reflected a natural corporate instinct to act in the interest of shareholders, not the U.S. government. If Tillerson is confirmed, \u201cI would hope that he\u2019d realize that he\u2019s serving the interests of the country and not the interests of Exxon,\u201d said Gordon, now a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Lawmakers will weigh Tillerson\u2019s decades-long track record at Exxon this week when they convene to consider his nomination to be the next U.S. foreign policy chief. The world\u2019s largest oil firm, Exxon has long exercised formidable clout in countries where it does business. The company has not shied away from controversy, inking deals with autocratic governments and speaking out against sanctions, such as those the United States has imposed on Russia, that hurt its bottom line. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) [ Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state may bring showdown with Republicans ] Exxon was one of the firms hungry to do business in Iraq, closed to outside investors for decades, after the ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003. By 2009, the Iraqi government had put its top fields on offer. While the terms of those deals were seen as stingy \u2014 paying $1.50 to $2 a barrel \u2014 firms signed on anyway, betting that a foot in the door would lead to other, more-lucrative opportunities. Exxon and its partner Shell snared the rights to West Qurna, a massive field in the country\u2019s south. But Iraq, looking to retain tight control of precious resources after years of U.S. occupation, never offered the more advantageous deals. \u201cSome said, \u2018Let\u2019s take this as an appetizer, not the main course,\u2019 \u201d said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. \u201cThen they were told, \u2018No, this is the course.\u2019 \u201d At their sprawling, bunker-like embassy in Baghdad, American diplomats heralded the new deals as a validation of U.S. ambitions to transform Iraq into a stable, business-friendly outpost in the Middle East. If it was an American company landing one of the country\u2019s biggest fields, all the better. But Exxon officials were growing increasingly dismayed by early 2011 as they saw their narrow profit margin in southern Iraq all but disappear. To make matters worse, the Iraqi government was constantly in arrears. By the end of that year, it owed Exxon about $1\u00a0billion, according to a former Exxon official. Ali Khedery, who advised U.S. officials in Iraq before joining Exxon in 2011, argued that the Kurdistan region was one way to offset the disappointment in southern Iraq. Oil reserves in the northern region had not been explored, but its basins appeared to make it \u201cone of the world\u2019s most promising regions for the future [of] hydrocarbon discovery,\u201d one paper said, with potentially as much as 55\u00a0billion untapped barrels. In its capital city of Irbil, the region\u2019s government portrayed itself as a Western-friendly alternative to Baghdad, where car bombs and militiamen continued to keep outside investors away. For Kurdish leaders, establishing the region in world oil markets was a crucial step toward the dream of eventual independence. Beginning in 2002, Kurdish leaders had welcomed small firms that were willing to brave an untested environment. By 2011, as Kurdish ties with neighbor Turkey improved, a hoped-for export pipeline looked more likely. But much about doing business in Iraqi Kurdistan remained laden with risk. Since 2003, Kurds had sparred with the Arab-led government in Baghdad over disputed areas and budget revenue. In the years leading up to Exxon\u2019s deal, Kurdish peshmerga troops had come close to open conflict with the Iraqi army, forcing the United States to intervene. \u201cThis was part of a bigger game of political leverage that was going on since the overthrow of Saddam in 2003, taking advantage of a weak central government, an ambiguous constitution,\u201d Denise Natali, an expert on northern Iraq at National Defense University in Washington, said of Kurdish attempts to expand influence through oil deals. [ Who is Rex Tillerson? ] But Khedery said the region remained attractive. \u201cDespite it being far from perfect \u2014 the endemic corruption, the factionalism \u2014 the bottom-line assessment was that Kurdistan was going to be a much better operating environment than the Arab portion of the country,\u201d he said. In April 2011, after internal briefings about Iraq to senior Exxon officials, a team from Exxon and Shell met with Kurdish officials. Kurdish and company executives eventually settled on six fields that would be explored by the foreign firms. Afraid of losing out to other firms, Exxon raced to finish the talks. After Shell dropped out at the last minute, the company concluded the contract in October 2011. When news of the deal broke, some U.S. officials felt they were not given adequate notice by Exxon. Former company officials dispute that account. Either way, diplomats were worried the deal would disrupt parliamentary negotiations over the oil law and undercut their clout with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki at a particularly sensitive time. For months, U.S. and Iraqi officials had been holding tense talks over a proposal to leave thousands of American troops beyond a departure deadline at the end of 2011. Only a few days after Exxon signed its deal, President Obama abruptly announced the talks had failed: All U.S. troops would be gone by year\u2019s end, officially bringing the war to an end. In assessing the fallout from the Kurdistan deal, U.S. diplomats were worried Iraq would throw Exxon out of the south, where they had also signed on to a deal that would be important in helping Iraq increase production across its biggest fields. U.S. officials had long cautioned American firms against signing deals with Iraqi Kurdistan before the oil legislation was completed, but they stopped short of telling them they could not do them \u2014 they had no power, former officials said, to do so. \u201cThe U.S. government position with American and other firms seeking to engage in the north was to explain the complexities, warn of the unsettled nature of the laws applying to that, point out the complications in trying to get any oil discovered and produced out of Kurdistan, given the position of the Iraqi government,\u201d said then-Ambassador James Jeffrey, who now acts as an adviser to Exxon. Adding to the friction, three of Exxon\u2019s new blocks were in areas claimed by both Baghdad and Irbil, outside of the regional borders set before 2003. Despite the unresolved status of those areas, Kurdish officials argued that they, not the Iraqi government, controlled those plots. Exxon lawyers concluded contracts for those areas would be legal. When Hussein al-Shahristani, who was Iraq\u2019s oil minister at the time Exxon signed its deal for West Qurna, learned about the deal, he was irate. \u201cThe position of the Iraqi government was always to reject this, and the company was informed that this was a violation of Iraqi law,\u201d Shahristani said. While Iraq sought to deal with foreign firms \u201cwith trust and good intentions,\u201d he said, \u201cthis move by ExxonMobil shook our confidence in them.\u201d [ Tillerson reveals personal wealth of up to $400 million ] In securing the Exxon deal, Iraqi Kurdistan had wooed one of the largest U.S. companies and got it to lay claim to disputed areas, creating a foundation for greater independence and clearing a path for other companies, including Chevron, to follow. \u201cPeople said, \u2018This is a boomtown.\u2019 You couldn\u2019t talk rhyme or reason, they were so excited about it,\u201d Natali said of companies\u2019 view of their Kurdistan oil prospects. \u201cThey created a bubble that ignored history, domestic politics, geopolitics.\u201d Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman, Irbil\u2019s envoy to the United States, said that Kurdistan\u2019s oil contracts \u201chave put the Kurdistan region on the global energy map and have helped to internationalize our economy after years of enforced isolation.\u201d Officials in Baghdad saw Exxon\u2019s decision to sign up for blocks such as Bashiqa, which lies entirely outside the current Kurdistan regional borders, as siding with Kurds in the land dispute. \u201cWhen any company comes and works in those areas, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s contributing in inflaming a conflict and pouring oil on the flames,\u201d Shahristani said. Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, said the company followed \u201call laws and regulations\u201d in pursuing the Iraqi Kurdistan deal. \u201cIssues involving management of hydrocarbon resources in the Kurdistan region of Iraq are for the Iraqi people to resolve,\u201d he said. Shahristani, who by the fall of 2011 had become deputy prime minister for energy matters, advised Maliki to withdraw the Qurna contract and take Exxon to international arbitration. As Baghdad made threats, Exxon tried to convince Iraqi officials that greater production would benefit the country in the long run. In January 2013, Tillerson flew to Baghdad and met with Maliki himself. There, Tillerson told Maliki that Exxon was \u201cprepared to stay and operate in both [parts of the country] and it was the Iraqi government\u2019s choice,\u201d said a former senior State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cHe didn\u2019t blink. In the end, he came away with that deal.\u201d By that point, the stakes in assessing a potential expulsion were already lower for Exxon, which had begun selling off parts of its unprofitable West Qurna interests. The Iraqi Oil Ministry, despite its threats, never brought legal action against Exxon, but it did seek to exclude Exxon from a later auction and push it out of the southern production-boosting project. \u201cI think a big part of it was Tillerson,\u201d the former official continued. \u201cHe personally went out and negotiated with all the individuals including Maliki and explained why it was in their interest to have the largest private oil company in the world operating in Iraq and the negative signals that would be sent if they would leave them out.\u201d Even after weathering the blowback from Baghdad, disappointing exploration results prompted Exxon to pull out of three of its six northern blocks in early 2016, walking away after spending over $500\u00a0million, according to the Iraq Oil Report. Like other firms, Exxon had found that Iraqi Kurdistan was not as good a deal as hoped. One official with a rival oil company, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a another major energy firm, said companies such as Exxon approach doing business in risky, politically unsettled places such as Iraq with a decades-long perspective. \u201cYou may not like the administration in any particular country today, but in 10 years time there\u2019s going to be a different government,\u201d he said. In the end, he said, big firms \u201chave to go to where the oil is and then manage the politics around that.\u201d Mustafa Salim in Baghdad, Loveday Morris in London and Karen DeYoung and Julie Tate in Washington contributed to this report. world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 9, 2017 11:32 PM EST FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida - The Iraq war veteran accused of fatally shooting five people and wounding six at a crowded Florida airport baggage claim briefly appeared in federal court Monday in Fort Lauderdale. U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia Valle explained the charges 26-year-old Esteban Santiago faces and told him the death penalty could apply during a 15-minute hearing Monday morning. Ft. Lauderdale shooter thought the government was using mind control Valle ordered Santiago to be temporarily detained without bond. A detention hearing has been scheduled for next week. Security was tight outside the courthouse with more than two-dozen officers in bulletproof vests. Santiago wore a red jumpsuit and was shackled at the wrists, stomach and legs. Santiago has been in custody since the Friday afternoon shooting. He answered the judge\u2019s questions in a clear voice. He told the judge he worked for a security firm in Anchorage, Alaska, until November. He said he only has about $5 to $10 in the bank. Given his finances, the judge decided he\u2019s eligible for government lawyers at taxpayer expense. The judge set a detention hearing for Jan. 17 and an arraignment hearing on Jan. 23. In a press release about Santiago\u2019s charges, the Department of Justice said Santiago is accused of being in the Terminal 2 baggage claim area of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. Florida airport shooting suspect was known by FBI agents \u201cThe area  was crowded with newly-arrived passengers retrieving their luggage,\u201d the press release stated. \u201cSantiago started shooting, aiming at his victims\u2019 heads until he was out  of ammunition.\u201d Santiago was arrested after running out of ammunition and lying spread-eagle on the floor until a deputy took him in to custody, his 9mm handgun nearby. \u00a0\u00a0 Although the charges carry a potential death sentence, the Justice Department will decide later whether to pursue that penalty assuming Santiago is convicted. Many other issues can come into play, such as whether he decides to plead guilty or go to trial. Guilty pleas usually do not result in death sentences. The airport violence charge allows a sentencing judge wide latitude in deciding how many years behind bars he might serve, all the way up to life in prison, if the death penalty is off the table. \u00a0\u00a0 Santiago\u2019s attorney can ask for a mental competency evaluation to determine if he is fit to stand trial. It\u2019s a fairly high standard for any defendant to escape criminal charges because of mental problems because many defendants understand the difference between right and wrong. The main issue for the court is whether a defendant is too impaired to assist in his own defense. Most defendants who go this route are ultimately judged fit for trial and the mental health issue becomes a major factor at sentencing. \u00a0\u00a0 Santiago, 26, apparently\u00a0 had trouble controlling his anger after serving in Iraq and told his brother that he felt he was being chased and controlled by the CIA through secret online messages. When he told agents at an FBI field office his paranoid thoughts in November, he was evaluated for four days, then released without any follow-up medication or therapy.\u00a0 \u201cThe FBI failed there,\u201d Bryan Santiago told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about someone who emerged from anonymity to do something like this.\u201d\u00a0 Victims of the Ft. Lauderdale Airport attack.&nbsp; Close CBS News Speaking in Spanish outside his family\u2019s house in Penuelas, the brother said: \u201cThe federal government already knew about this for months, they had been evaluating him for a while, but they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u00a0 A law enforcement source said when Santiago -- who had been living in Anchorage, Alaska -- walked into the FBI office in November, he had a handgun in his possession, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. It is not known if the handgun was the 9mm handgun that authorities said Santiago used in the Florida attack on Friday.\u00a0 The weapon had been taken away when he entered the FBI reception area and was held while he was interviewed by the FBI, Milton reports. When the Anchorage Police Department transported Santiago to the hospital, they took possession of the weapon.\u00a0 Without a judge\u2019s order to commit him, the police had no choice but to return the gun, a source tells CBS News correspondent David Begnaud.\u00a0 A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation tells CBS News that Santiago booked a flight from Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport to New York\u2019s JFK Airport on to San Juan, Puerto Rico. He would have arrived in NYC on New Year\u2019s Day. Santiago had a habit of booking flights and then cancelling them, the source said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

His ties around the globe include a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. USA TODAY NETWORK Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's nominee to head the State Department and former ExxonMobil chairman and CEO, addresses the World Gas Conference in Paris on June 2, 2015. President-elect Trump nominated Tillerson for secretary of State on Dec 13, 2016. (Photo: Eric Piermont, AFP/Getty Images) ExxonMobil did business with Iran, Syria and Sudan through a European subsidiary while President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of State was a top executive of\u00a0the oil giant\u00a0and those countries were under U.S. sanctions as state sponsors of terrorism, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. That business connection is likely to\u00a0surface Wednesday at a confirmation hearing for ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The sales were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 by Infineum, in which ExxonMobil owned a 50% share, according to SEC\u00a0documents unearthed by American Bridge, a Democratic research group. ExxonMobil told USA TODAY the transactions were legal because Infineum, a joint venture with Shell Corporation, was based in Europe and the transactions did not involve any\u00a0U.S. employees. The filings, from 2006, show that the company had $53.2 million\u00a0in sales to Iran, $600,000 in sales to Sudan and $1.1 million in sales to Syria during those three years. Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson's ties to Russia worry GOP, too He\u00a0became a senior vice president at ExxonMobil in August 2001,\u00a0president and director in March 2004\u00a0and chairman and chief executive on Jan. 1, 2006. The SEC letter questioned ExxonMobil\u2019s failure to disclose to shareholders that it had transactions with three state sponsors of terrorism. Decisions to make such disclosures should be based on \u201cthe potential impact of corporate activities upon a company`s reputation and share value,\u201d and not simply\u00a0the monetary value of the transactions, the SEC said. Compared to Exxon\u2019s overall annual revenue of $371 billion, \u201cthese transactions are not material by any reasonable measure,\u201d Richard Gutman, ExxonMobil\u2019s assistant general counsel at the time, wrote in response to an SEC inquiry regarding the transactions. He did not address the SEC's concerns about the impact on the oil company's reputation Infineum\u2019s European affiliates manage business transactions in those three countries \u201cunder a policy and procedure consistent with U.S. legal requirements and no United States person is involved in those business transactions,\u201d Gutman wrote. The subsidiary has offices in the United States, United Kingdom\u00a0and Singapore. \u201cThese are all legal activities complying with the sanctions at the time,\" Alan Jeffers, media manager at ExxonMobil, told USA TODAY. \"We didn\u2019t feel they were material because of the size of the transactions.\u201d Nine Trump nominees face Senate hearings this week \u201cThey (Infineum) have an independent management that operates the entity. And it\u2019s not a U.S. entity,\u201d Jeffers said. At the time of the SEC inquiry, such indirect transactions between Iran and American companies were not unusual, said Mark Dubowitz, an expert on Iran sanctions at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a\u00a0Washington think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason Congress eventually shut down U.S. companies from doing business (with Iran) through foreign subsidiaries,\u201d Dubowitz said. Congress also required\u00a0such transactions to be disclosed. The\u00a0Iran nuclear deal that went into effect in early 2016 reopened the loophole\u00a0under certain conditions, Dubowitz said. Sen.\u00a0Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, said he was \u201cdeeply skeptical about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s actions as CEO of Exxon that were in direct contravention to express United States policies put in place to secure Americans and our country.\" \"Finding loopholes to make lucrative business deals with geo-political adversaries, while showing no clear regard for U.S. national interests, is not a resume builder for a prospective diplomat-in-chief,\" Menendez said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"This is one of the many issues I look forward to hearing more about during the upcoming confirmation hearings.\u201d 1697 CONNECT TWEET 6 LINKEDIN 164 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jmvyOE NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

And the confirmation hearings for Donald Trump's Cabinet picks haven't even started yet. Trump may face the rockiest path of any of his recent predecessors in filling his Cabinet. Democrats in Congress are already threatening to slow-walk confirmation proceedings if nominees don't turn over background information and financial disclosures on time. And they've identified a hefty chunk of the Cabinet designees - eight - as prime targets for aggressive questioning. Chief on that list are Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson, whose close relationship with Russia during his decades in the oil industry will be a key point of contention, and Attorney General pick Jeff Sessions, whose past comments on race derailed his 1986 bid to become a federal judge. Also atop the target list is Trump's pick to head the Health and Human Services Department, Tom Price, who faces questions about buying and selling medical company stocks while serving as a top policy-making official.

For the last four decades, Senate votes on a new president's Cabinet picks have largely been a civil affair. Since the Carter era, about three-quarters of each incoming president's first set of Cabinet picks have been approved unanimously by members of the United States Senate, and all but about a dozen have suffered only one or two dissenting votes. (Newcomers to American politics would be surprised to hear that all but two Republican senators gave a greenlight to incoming Secretary of State Hillary Clinton one day after President Barack Obama was inaugurated.) Still, each of the last six presidents have faced at least one problematic nominee, although those with significant baggage \u2014 like Clinton Attorney General nominee Zoe Baird, Bush 43 Labor nominee Linda Chavez and Obama Cabinet picks Bill Richardson and Tom Daschle \u2014 have tended to withdraw their names from consideration before the vote or even before confirmation hearings begin. Here's a rundown of some of the most divided confirmation votes for Cabinet picks made by an incoming president in the last 40 years: JOHN TOWER - Secretary of State (47 yea, 53 nay) Only once have members of the Senate voted to reject a first-term president's Cabinet nominee \u2014 and they did it to a former member of their own Capitol Hill club. Former senator John Tower of Texas, George H.W. Bush's pick for his first Secretary of Defense, was rejected by a vote of 47-53 after an extremely public debate about his personal life that scandalized those used to Washington's typical decorum. After weeks of gossip about Tower's personal dalliances, including an FBI investigation into his background, conservative activist Paul Weyrich went public with his own charges at Tower's confirmation hearing, saying, \"Over the course of many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition, a lack of sobriety, as well as with women to whom he was not married.\" Tower acknowledged drinking to excess in the past but insisted that he did not have a problem with alcohol, telling committee chairman Sam Nunn, \"I am a man of some discipline.\" In addition to the more salacious accusations about his private conduct, Tower also faced allegations that he was too cozy with the defense contracting industry. Attempts to save his nomination \u2014 including Tower's televised pledge to quit drinking entirely if confirmed \u2014 weren't enough to prevent a humiliating defeat at the hands of his own former colleagues. Tower's demise resulted in a promotion for another Republican politician who would become a household name in America; Bush selected Wyoming Rep. Dick Cheney as Tower's replacement. Play ",

A Roseville, Mich., man is becoming Facebook famous after he posted a picture of a ticket he received from a Roseville cop for warming up his vehicle in his own\u00a0driveway. Nick Taylor posted the sarcastic Facebook post on Thursday, thanking the\u00a0officer\u00a0who gave him the ticket. According to the picture, the ticket is for his car that was left running in the driveway with no one around. \"I've never heard of any city ordinance of\u00a0law\u00a0like that,\" Taylor said. OHIO POLICE OFFICER GIVES GPS TO LOST ELDERLY DRIVER HEADING TO FLORIDA On Thursday, it was frigidly cold and he wanted to keep his car running while he ran into his girlfriend's house. But he left it unlocked with the key in the ignition. Chief James Berlin said that's a problem. \"This is purely a public safety issue. You can't do it. You see it all the time, people hop in a running car and Steal them. Something bad happens when that occurs,\" Berlin said. The post received thousands of comments and shares since he posted it. \"I mostly just put it online to see what people thought of it and see if it's happened to anyone else because I've never heard of this,\" Taylor said. The ticket shows ordinance listed as 99006 but there is no ordinance\u00a0in the city\u00a0or state that corresponds to 99006. Under the description of the offense, it lists VEH/MOTOR ON UNATTENDED 895. Ordinance 895 is listed as being part of 'rodent control' on Roseville's website. FOX 2 contacted the Michigan\u00a0State\u00a0Police for more information. Lt. Mike Shaw says there is no state law that prohibits letting your car idle with the keys in the ignition. At this point, it seems difficult to decipher which code the officer was enforcing. Either way, Nick has an appointment on January 26th in District Court in Roseville. ",

    "text": "What Happened Within This Player\u2019s Skull By SAM BORDEN , MIKA GR\u00d6NDAHL and JOE WARD JAN. 9, 2017 When player No. 81 took this blow to his head several years ago, it was just one of many concussions that have occurred throughout college football and the N.F.L. But what made this one different was that this player was wearing a mouth guard with motion sensors. The information from those sensors has given researchers a more detailed and precise window into what was happening within the player\u2019s brain in the milliseconds after the hit. Here is what happened to his brain. One common belief has been that just after a person\u2019s head (or helmet) makes contact with something \u2013 an airbag, a wall, another person \u2013 the brain within bounces around in the skull like an egg yolk in a shell, leaving bruises on the brain\u2019s outer surface, or gray matter. Now, though, many scientists and medical experts believe that this understanding is incomplete. Yes, there is some movement in the skull, but the real damage from concussions, they say, actually occurs deeper in the brain \u2013 in the so-called white matter \u2013 as a result of fibers pulling and twisting after impact. To stick with the food analogy, think Jell-O, not an egg. You know what happens when you take a plate of Jell-O and give it a hard shake? The stretches and contortions approximate what is happening to all the wiring throughout the brain. To better track the brain\u2019s reaction to these hits, scientists in several labs have been working on a variety of mechanisms, some of which, like the one used during the impact shown above, are moving away from ones connected directly to a football helmet because the helmet can move independently of the skull. \u201cThe forces you\u2019re measuring with those are not really exactly what the brain is seeing,\u201d said Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurosurgery at the Boston University School of Medicine. The mouth guard that was used was developed by the bioengineer David Camarillo and his team at the Cam Lab at Stanford. Camarillo and others have speculated that the most damaging blows are those that cause the head to snap quickly from ear to ear, like the one shown above, or those that cause a violent rotation or twisting of the head through a glancing blow. \u201cThe brain\u2019s wiring, essentially, is all running from left to right, not front to back,\u201d Camarillo said, referring to the primary wiring that connects the brain\u2019s hemispheres. \u201cSo the direction you are struck can have a very different effect within the brain. In football, the presence of the face mask can make that sort of twisting even more extreme.\u201d These revelations are a powerful indication that football helmets as they are now designed do not protect players from concussions and long-term brain disease like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E. But Camarillo and others are hopeful that as more data becomes available and as more is learned about the brain\u2019s inner turmoil during hits to the head, helmet design will improve. Linemen sustain multitudes of hits to the head during games and practices. Bedel Saget/The New York Times But scientists also commonly believe that this kind of brain disease is caused not only by these severe concussive hits, but also by the accumulation of more minor blows. Consider the image shown above: It is the sort of line-of-scrimmage battle that happens on almost every play in football and does not seem nearly as bad as the concussive hit sustained by the receiver that we showed you earlier. But data from a single game showed that one college offensive lineman took 62 of these smaller blows to the head. One Game, 62 Hits to the Head. G-forces of 10 hits (each line represents one hit) 50 ",

    "text": "Volkswagen Executive Arrested for Alleged Role in Emissions 'Conspiracy' By Erin Dooley Jan 9, 2017, 7:29 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Volkswagen to Shed 30,000 Jobs to Cut Costs After Scandal 0 Shares Email Volkswagen executive Oliver Schmidt was arrested by the FBI on Saturday for his alleged role in the company\u2019s suspected \"scheme\" to cheat emissions standards , according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday. Schmidt, who led the automaker\u2019s U.S. environmental regulatory compliance office from 2012 to 2015, allegedly conspired with other VW employees to defraud the federal government \u2013- and American consumers -\u2013 by concealing the installation of a device designed to cheat emissions tests. He is the second VW employee arrested in the alleged conspiracy. (Engineer James Liang pleaded guilty to his role in the scandal last fall.) EPA Expands Emissions Testing Procedures Amid VW Scandal The defeat device software, installed on around half a million diesel cars sold in this country between 2009 and 2015, could detect when the car was undergoing emissions evaluations and decrease its nitrogen oxide emissions to comply with American standards. When the software recognized the car was on the road, however, it would allow emissions up to 40 times higher than standards permit. Based on the testimony of Liang, along with two anonymous VW employees who made a deal with the government to evade prosecution if they complied with the investigation, as well as two California Air Resources Board employees and several emails sent by Schmidt himself, the complaint alleges Schmidt knew about the devices and attempted to conceal their existence, waving off the testing results as \u201cirregularities\u201d or \u201cabnormalities.\u201d Broward Sheriffs Office via Getty Images Oliver Schmidt, an executive for Volkswagen, is expected to be charged with conspiracy and fraud in the Volkswagen emissions scandal. Schmidt was formerly a key emissions compliance manager for VW in the U.S. \u201cIt should first be decided whether we are honest. If we are not honest, everything stays as it is,\u201d he allegedly said in an email to his colleagues concerning a study commissioned by the International Counsel on Clean Transportation, which noted discrepancies between the vehicles\u2019 day-to-day NOx output and emissions during testing. \u201cICCT has stupidly just published measurements of NAR diesel off-cycle, not good.\u201d \u201cDifference between street and test stand must be explained \u2026 intent = penalty!\u201d Schmidt allegedly noted in a later email to VW America\u2019s then-CEO. The arrest comes on the heels of a $15 billion settlement in which Volkswagen agreed to buy back or repair defective vehicles in the U.S. and put billions into environmental remediation. Schmidt\u2019s lawyers did not immediately respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment. He has a hearing scheduled for Thursday in Miami. In a statement, Volkswagen said the company \u201ccontinues to cooperate with the Department of Justice as we work to resolve remaining matters in the United States. It would not be appropriate to comment on any ongoing investigations or to discuss personnel matters.\u201d ABC News' Mike Levine and Daniel Steinberger contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY Sports Clemson Tigers head coach Dabo Swinney looks on during Clemson Tigers practice at Tampa Bay Buccaneers Complex. (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports) USA TODAY Sports examines what it will take for the Tigers to leave Monday victorious vs. Alabama.\u00a0 1. Win the turnover battle, or come close The hand wringing over Clemson\u2019s turnovers is misguided, seeing that Deshaun Watson and the offense have been a touch sloppy with the football yet still stand\u00a0within a victory of the program\u2019s first title since 1981. So the Tigers don\u2019t need to win the turnover battle, necessarily. What Clemson must do, however, is limit their mistakes in the passing game and be aggressive when Alabama is in clear passing downs. If he\u2019s smart with the football \u2014 but still confident enough to take his shots \u2014 Watson will achieve things against Alabama\u2019s defense that no quarterback has done this entire season. MORE: Mike Williams could be the difference-maker for Clemson this title game 2. Win from guard to guard Any doubts about the ability of Clemson\u2019s defensive line to dominate a high-profile opponent were put to bed in the win against Ohio State. The Tigers are loaded with 300-pound behemoths from end to end, with standouts in Christian Wilkins, Carlos Watkins and Dexter Lawrence set to present issues for Alabama\u2019s offensive front. Though Alabama is better overall, the same plan for topping the Buckeyes will stand for the Crimson Tide. If the Tigers win the battle along the interior, they\u2019ll win the day. Take note of Lawrence in particular; though only a true freshman, he\u00a0already is one of the most physically imposing players in college football. 3. Spread them out How do you beat Alabama? It\u2019s not by being traditional, as was Washington in the Peach Bowl. Playing that way fits right into Alabama\u2019s hands. Scoring on the Tide demands a more multiple and up-tempo approach, two qualities that have come to define the Tigers\u2019 offense. Look for Clemson to lean on their deep receiver corps, led by Mike Williams, while slowly hammering away at Alabama with Wayne Gallman and the running game. Being unpredictable and varied in formation, scheme and tempo will keep even Alabama\u2019s elite unit on their toes. MORE: ",

Financial literacy is a great goal for 2017. Personal savings (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) The Center for Financial Literacy at Champlain College\u00a0in 2015\u00a0produced a\u00a0 report card \u00a0that graded how well high schools in America teach personal finance.\u00a0Then last month we released\u00a0a state-by-state\u00a0 report card \u00a0on adult financial literacy. In both cases, the news was not good. There\u2019s no avoiding the fact that personal finance education in this country is an afterthought. As a result, too many adults flounder financially, leaving important milestones like college and retirement up to chance. There are a handful of states taking this problem seriously, improving courses offered in school and college, but the majority of high school graduates go off to college or the workplace with no clue. Is it any wonder American adults don\u2019t budget and parents are nearly as comfortable talking to their kids about sex as they are about personal finance? Some day, I hope to see the subject of personal finance valued as much in the classroom as reading and math. Until then, for those adults who would like to improve their finance literacy\u00a0in 2017,\u00a0I have a few suggestions. First of all, don\u2019t buy a house or car you cannot afford. Before the Great Recession, folks were using homes like ATMs, refinancing or taking out home-equity loans to get cash. Today, more than 10% of homeowners are \u201cseriously underwater,\u201d meaning they owe at least more than 25% on their homes than they are worth today. Here's how to reform Obamacare: Column Every month nearly a third of homeowners are spending 30% or more of their household income on the costs of owning their home.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s no wonder they struggle to make ends meet. Then on top of that add\u00a0the monthly payment on the average $30,000 six-year loan for a new auto, with interest ranging from 5% to 14% \u00a0\u00a0depending on your credit score. Sometimes smaller is better and less stressful.\u00a0 Treat your credit card like a loaded gun \u2014 use it very carefully. Charge only as much as you can pay off each month. The average credit card balance is more than $5,000 . That is equal to about 10% of the median household income .\u00a0That $600 iPad you are looking at for Christmas will take you more than five years to pay off if you just send in the minimum payment to your credit card provider, and it will cost you more than $850 at 19% interest . It makes no financial sense. Short-term savings drop-off can be OK, if you plan for it Speaking of credit, many adults spend more than $100,000 over their lifetimes \u00a0on high-interest loans, late fees and the like. You should understand credit\u00a0and care deeply about improving your credit score. A low credit score means you will pay more when using that credit card, and the home and cars you finance with loans will also cost you more. If you do the above, you can \u201cpay yourself first.\u201d\u00a0That means saving. You should have at least three months of living expenses in the bank. You should contribute to an Individual Retirement Account,\u00a0especially if you don\u2019t have a retirement plan at work. If you do have a retirement savings plan at work, and your employer matches your contributions, don\u2019t miss this this golden opportunity. If you get a dollar-for-dollar match, it\u2019s better than any investment on Wall Street. Learn as much as you can about personal finance. Some progressive employers offer financial wellness programs. Employers are starting to recognize that retirement plan training is not enough \u2014 employees also need general financial advice.\u00a0Take advantage of such training. Go to your community college and ask if they have personal finance courses. If they don\u2019t, and enough adults ask for it, it\u2019s likely the college would add such a course. And you can always and continually educate yourself by reading as much as you can about personal finance. Talk to your kids about personal finance. Make sure their schools are offering courses. And when searching for college, ask whether the subject is taught, even if not for credit. I\u2019m proud to say Champlain College, where our center is located, requires personal finance learning . People need financial sophistication to succeed in the 21st century, yet surveys show that our citizens have not mastered these essential life skills . \u00a0It\u2019s likely not their\u00a0fault, as the educational system to this point for the most part has failed them. But that doesn't mean we can't all educate ourselves. A great resolution for 2017\u00a0would be\u00a0to embrace the basics of personal finance and learn the true value of money \u2014 why it\u2019s so important to save it, invest it and not waste it.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Dan Lamothe January 9 at 4:58 PM Follow @danlamothe Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis is seen during a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Dec. 7. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) Retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, nominated to be the next secretary of defense, has received millions of dollars of income since leaving the military, including through lucrative speaking engagements with companies such as Goldman Sachs and Northrop Grumman and paid positions with Theranos, Stanford University and General Dynamics. The details were disclosed in part through records newly released by the Office of Government Ethics . Mattis, who retired as chief of U.S. Central Command (Centcom) in 2013, said in a memo to the Pentagon dated Jan. 5 that he will not participate \u201cpersonally and substantially\u201d in any matters in which he knows he has a financial interest without seeking a legal waiver. The financial documents were first reported on by Politico . The general\u2019s financial moves since retirement are not uncommon among his peers, who often make far more after leaving the military than they did while serving. But the newly released documents provide a window into the financial opportunities for a retired senior military leader and present a complication as he is considered by the Senate to be the Pentagon\u2019s senior civilian leader. Mattis\u2019s most significant forms of income since retiring include salary of $419,359 as a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution and fees of $242,000 as a member of the board of directors at the defense contractor General Dynamics, according to the documents. Mattis also received $150,000 in fees as a member of the board of directors at Theranos, the controversial Silicon Valley blood-testing firm. He pushed for its technology to be incorporated while chief of Centcom, according to emails obtained and previously detailed by The Washington Post. The usefulness of the firm\u2019s technology was called into question, and it has since fallen from grace and laid off dozens of employees. [ Emails reveal concerns about Theranos\u2019s FDA compliance date back years ] As a retired four-star officer with 41 years of service ending in 2013, he also is entitled to an annual federal pension of more than $240,000. Mattis\u2019s positions with Stanford, General Dynamics and Theranos all have been previously reported. He already has resigned from the Theranos board and other leadership positions, including at the Center for a New American Security, the Marines\u2019 Memorial Club in San Francisco, the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation and the Tri-Cities Food Bank in his home state of Washington. He will resign from Hoover and General Dynamics if confirmed, his memo said. The honorariums that Mattis received include several $25,000 appearances, including one each with Lincoln Financial Services, Citi Corp., and the World Presidents Organization, a group of chief executives. Mattis also received $20,000 each for appearances with Goldman Sachs, Northrop Grumman, DirecTV and the Howard G. Buffet Foundation. Retired U.S. Marine Corps General James Mattis has been chosen to be secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Other honorariums include $16,000 for speaking to the Global Leadership Coalition, $15,000 for speaking at the July 2015 conference for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and $12,500 for speaking to the American Society for Industrial Security International. Mattis received several other honorariums of a few thousand-dollars each. Mattis took the position at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution in August 2013, a few months after retiring. He has focused his research there heavily on the relationships between the military and the civilian world, recently editing a book, \u201cWarriors and Citizens: American Views of Our Military,\u201d along with another Hoover fellow, Kori N. Schake. Mattis also joined the General Dynamics board in 2013. His financial disclosure documents state that he has $250,000 and $500,000 in restricted stock that is not vested and $250,000 to $500,000 in vested stocks. He will liquidate nonvested stocks and options within 90 days of his confirmation, his memo said. The retired general also has a publishing agreement with Random House for royalties from the future publication of an untitled book he has written, Mattis disclosed. While serving as secretary of defense, he will not engage in any writing, editing or promotional activities for it, the memo said. Related on Checkpoint: ",

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Dec. 22, 2016. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy The Illinois Senate on Monday easily approved Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's plan to shore up two city worker pension funds, but the measure faces an uncertain future now that it's headed to a skeptical Gov. Bruce Rauner. The mayor's bill is aimed at preventing retirement systems for municipal workers and laborers from going broke in about a decade. The two funds are a combined $21 billion short of what's needed to pay out future benefits, and the plan relies on newly hired employees paying more toward their retirement. The House approved the bill 91-16 last month, and on Monday the Senate followed suit, 41-0. But the Rauner administration, which is seeking a broader deal to cut costs in state worker pension systems, responded Monday by throwing some cold water on the plan. \"The governor cannot support this bill without real pension reform that protects taxpayers,\" Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said in a statement. The clock is on Rauner's side. The current General Assembly is in its final days, and the new legislature with many different members will be sworn in Wednesday. If the governor waits to veto or tweak the bill until the current session is over, the bill would die because the new legislature wouldn't have the authority to try to overturn him. Emanuel issued a statement after Monday's vote praising the legislature for acting in \"a bipartisan manner.\" Mayoral spokesman Adam Collins blasted Rauner, calling him \"Governor Gridlock.\" That, in turn, led Rauner spokesman Lance Trover to call Emanuel \"Madigan's mayor,\" a reference to long-serving House Speaker Michael Madigan, the governor's chief political nemesis. Under the mayor's proposal, newly hired employees would start paying 11.5 percent of their salaries toward their retirement, which is 3 percent more than current employees. In later years, that amount could be reduced if an independent number cruncher agreed that less was needed to meet the city's goal of having 90 percent of the assets needed to pay benefits over the next 40 years.

Got it Best Buy Geek Squad agent Josh Sorensen replaces a motherboard on a laptop at Geek Squad City in Brooks, Ky., in a 2012 file photo. A child pornography case launched at the facility led to the discovery that eight Geek Squad technicians had served as paid informants for the FBI. (Ken James/BLOOMBERG NEWS) By Tom Jackman January 9 at 6:00 PM Follow @TomJackmanWP At a giant Best Buy repair shop in Brooks, Ky., Geek Squad technicians work on computers owned by people across the country, delving into them to retrieve lost data. Over several years, a handful of those workers have notified the FBI when they see signs of child pornography, earning payments from the agency. The existence of the small cadre of informants within one of the country\u2019s most popular computer repair services was revealed in the case of a California doctor who is facing federal charges after his hard drive was flagged by a technician. The doctor\u2019s lawyers found that the FBI had cultivated eight \u201cconfidential human sources\u201d in the Geek Squad over a four-year period, according to a judge\u2019s order in the case, with all of them receiving some payment. The case raises issues about privacy and the government use of informants. If a customer turns over their computer for repair, do they forfeit their expectation of privacy, and their Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable searches? And if an informant is paid, does it compromise their credibility or effectively convert them into an agent of the government? Best Buy searching a computer is legal \u2014 the customer authorized it, and the law does not prohibit private searches. But if Best Buy serves as an arm of the government, then a warrant or specific consent is needed. And a federal judge in the child pornography case against Mark Rettenmaier is going to allow defense attorneys to probe the relationship between Best Buy and the FBI at a hearing in Los Angeles starting Wednesday. \u201cTheir relationship is so cozy,\u201d said defense attorney James D. Riddet, \u201cand so extensive that it turns searches by Best Buy into government searches. If they\u2019re going to set up that network between Best Buy supervisors and FBI agents, you run the risk that Best Buy is a branch of the FBI.\u201d The FBI and Justice Department declined to comment. Federal prosecutors argued in California that when a technician doing repairs \u201cstumbles across images of child pornography\u201d and the government wasn\u2019t aware of the search, \u201cthe technician is clearly not performing the search with the intent of assisting law enforcement efforts.\u201d Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman said in a statement Monday that \u201cBest Buy and Geek Squad have no relationship with the FBI. From time to time, our repair agents discover material that may be child pornography and we have a legal and moral obligation to turn that material over to law enforcement. We are proud of our policy and share it with our customers before we begin any repair.\u201d Shelman added, \u201cAny circumstances in which an employee received payment from the FBI is the result of extremely poor individual judgment, is not something we tolerate and is certainly not a part of our normal business behavior.\u201d Court records did not detail how often or how much the technicians were paid, other than one $500 payment to one supervisor. But emails between Geek Squad technicians and FBI agents in the Louisville field office indicate a long-running relationship. In revealing those publicly in a Dec. 19 order, U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney required technicians and agents to take the witness stand this week. The ruling was first reported by Orange County Weekly. Many of the documents establishing the ties between the FBI and the technicians are sealed, but Carney discussed some in his order. He noted that the FBI acknowledged it considered technician supervisor Justin Meade a confidential human source for all but a few months between October 2008 and November 2012. Different agents handled the Geek Squad technicians, Carney wrote. In October 2009, Agent Jennifer Cardwell emailed Meade to express interest in meeting \u201cto discuss some other ideas for collaboration,\u201d Carney disclosed. In an internal FBI communication in July 2010, Agent Tracey L. Riley told her supervisor that \u201cSource reported all has been quiet for about the last 5-6 months, however source agreed that once school started again, they may see an influx of CP [child pornography].\u201d Meade was later identified as the \u201csource.\u201d Other internal communications show the \u201csource\u201d referring possible cases to Riley from computers sent to the Geek Squad from across the country. \u201cThis two-way thoroughfare of information,\u201d Riddet, the defense attorney. argued in his motion to suppress the evidence, \u201csuggests that the FBI considers [Meade] . . . to be a partner in the ongoing effort of law enforcement to detect and prosecute child pornography violators. . . . Here it is very clear that Best Buy, and specifically the supervisor who reports its technician\u2019s discovery of \u2018inappropriate\u2019 content on customers\u2019 computers, are not only working together, but actually planning to conduct more such searches in the future.\u201d The case started in November 2011, when Rettenmaier, a gynecological oncologist in Orange County, Calif., took his HP Pavilion desktop to the Best Buy in Mission Viejo, Calif., because it wouldn\u2019t boot up. The technicians at the store told him he had a faulty hard drive. If he wanted to retain information from the hard drive, he would need the Geek Squad\u2019s data recovery services in Kentucky. Rettenmaier signed a service order that prosecutors argue \u201cwaived any right to raise a Fourth Amendment claim\u201d because it contained the admonition: \u201cI am on notice that any product containing child pornography will be turned over to the authorities.\u201d Rettenmaier\u2019s hard drive was shipped to Geek Squad City in Brooks, Ky., a suburb of Louisville. In December 2011, one of Meade\u2019s technicians located a photo that Riddet described as a nude prepubescent girl on a bed. In January 2012, court records show Meade emailed Agent Riley in Louisville and said, \u201cWe have another one out of California we want you to take a look at, when can you swing by?\u201d Meade did not respond to phone and email messages. Prosecutors acknowledged that the FBI paid him $500 in October 2011, two months before his co-worker discovered the photo. Meade filed a sworn declaration last year that \u201cI do not remember ever being paid by the FBI.\u201d The search of Rettenmaier\u2019s hard drive has a further wrinkle. The image was located on \u201cunallocated space,\u201d which is where deleted items reside on a computer until they are overwritten when the space is needed. Unallocated space is not easily accessed \u2014 it requires special forensic software. Prosecutors said that the Geek Squad technician who searched the unallocated space was merely trying to recover all the data Rettenmaier had asked to be restored. Riddet argued that the technician was going beyond the regular search to deleted material to find evidence the FBI might want. In addition, a federal appeals court has ruled that pornography found on unallocated space is insufficient to prove that the user possessed it, since information about when it was accessed, altered or deleted is no longer available. \u201cThere was no evidence of how the contraband got onto Dr. Rettenmaier\u2019s hard drive,\u201d Riddet wrote, \u201cand it could have gotten there before he possessed the computer or against his will.\u201d An internal FBI email indicated that agents knew charges were unlikely based on an image in unallocated space. But prosecutors did authorize a search warrant for Rettenmaier\u2019s computer and home, which was executed in February 2012. It is unclear why Rettenmaier was not indicted until almost three years later, in November 2014. Judge Carney will allow Rettenmaier\u2019s lawyer to question not only the Best Buy technicians and FBI agents involved in the case, but also the federal prosecutor who authorized the searches at the upcoming hearing. \u201cThe relationship between the FBI and Best Buy [informants] prior to Rettenmaier\u2019s hard drive\u2019s repair,\u201d Carney wrote, \u201cis relevant to how Meade understood his role as an informant and the possibility of an agency relationship between those who specified [the technician\u2019s] procedures and the government.\u201d Best Buy\u2019s Shelman said, \u201cTo be clear, our agents unintentionally find child pornography as they try to make the repairs the customer is paying for. They are not looking for it.\u201d He said store policy bars agents from doing \u201canything other than what is necessary to solve the customer\u2019s problem.\u201d Stan Goldman, a law professor at Loyola Law School, likened Best Buy\u2019s search to the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine for police: If officers can see something in plain view, they have reason to search or seize it. \u201cWhatever they see while searching within the scope of what they were asked to do would be admissible, in my view,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cIf they start searching on their own, they\u2019ve gone beyond what is \u2018plain view.\u2019 \u201d He said what a customer consents to when ordering the work is crucial. \u201cHave people actually understood that they\u2019ve agreed to have their entire computer searched? I don\u2019t think so, but you can\u2019t be 100 percent certain.\u201d local ",

Accompanied by an attorney, Zachary Cole Fernandez, 30, surrendered at 12:10 p.m. to Los Angeles Police Department detectives in Hollywood, according to Capt. Cory Palka. He was booked on the misdemeanor offense and released on $1,000 bail two hours later. Fernandez is scheduled to appear on Feb. 15 in Los Angeles Superior Court in downtown L.A., according to the Hollywood Division captain. The Hollywood sign was not damaged in Fernandez\u2019s prank, but the letters were briefly changed, police said.\u00a0 Police said surveillance footage showed a man dressed in\u00a0black, tactical-style gear\u00a0 scaling the sign\u2019s ladders and hanging tarps \u00a0over the O\u2019s to change them to E\u2019s at 3 a.m. on Jan. 1. One of the tarps was decorated with a peace sign, and another with a heart. \u201cThe Hollywood Sign has seen many alteration attempts over the years for people seeking notoriety or commercial gain,\u201d Los Angeles City Councilman David Ryu said in a statement. \u201cPranks of this nature deplete the resources of our valuable public safety personnel, in both responding to the prank and in responding to the increased crowds and copycat attempts that these incidents generate.\u201d Last week, an LAPD spokeswoman had said investigators were\u00a0\u201c talking to a person \u201d\u00a0in connection with New Year\u2019s Day prank. Officer Liliana Preciado said\u00a0detectives would not arrest\u00a0the prankster on suspicion of trespassing, but would instead\u00a0present their findings\u00a0to prosecutors. Days after the sign alteration, Fernandez, who calls himself\u00a0\u201cJesus Hands,\u201d\u00a0 told \u00a0Vice that he and his \u201ccreative partner/former wife, Sarah Fern,\u201d were responsible for the\u00a0prank. Fern and Fernandez said they aware they could face consequences for revealing their identifies. But Fern told Vice, \u201cWe\u2019re OK with that.\u201d Fern told the online magazine that they \u201cmapped it out together and double checked measurements and everything.\u201d Fernandez told Vice he used\u00a0a rope to swing around the letters and\u00a0used clamps to clip sheets of fabric and photographs to them. The entire act took about two hours, he told the magazine. The prank, they said, was an homage to Daniel Finegood,\u00a0a\u00a0 Cal State Northridge \u00a0student who pulled off the same act on New Year\u2019s Day in 1976. Finegood scaled Mt. Lee with $50 worth of curtains and changed the sign to coincide with the first day that California classified possession of up to one ounce of\u00a0marijuana as a misdemeanor, rather than a felony. The couple said they also drew inspiration from the divisive election, saying they hoped the piece brought conversation and positivity.

Erez Orbach, 20, also had Israeli citizenship, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Israel told ABC News. The other three soldiers have been identified as Yael Yekutiel, 20, Shir Hajaj, 22, and Shira Tzur, 20. They were getting off a bus during a sightseeing tour Sunday when the truck hopped the curb and crashed into them, killing all four. Seventeen other people were injured. MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP/Getty Images An Israeli forensics expert gathers evidence as security forces and emergency personnel gather at the site of a vehicle-ramming attack in Jerusalem, Jan. 8, 2017. The 28-year-old Palestinian attacker, Fadi Qunbar, was shot dead at the scene, officials said. Israeli police today increased security in Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, particularly in the neighborhood where the alleged attacker lived. The slain soldiers were expected to be laid to rest today. The Associated Press contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Earlier, when accepting the award, Streep was harshly critical of President-elect Donald Trump. Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP hide caption toggle caption Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Actor Meryl Streep poses in the press room with the Cecil B. deMille Award at the 74th annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, Calif. Earlier, when accepting the award, Streep was harshly critical of President-elect Donald Trump. Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Buzzed-about projects like the musical film La La Land and FX's TV comedy Atlanta won big at Sunday's Golden Globe awards. But the most powerful moment of the night belonged to Meryl Streep, who used her acceptance speech for the honorary Cecil B. deMille Award of the 2017 Golden Globes , to deliver a harsh rebuke of President-elect Donald Trump and to advocate for press freedom. 'La La Land' Dominates Golden Globe Awards Recalling the moment Trump mocked a disabled reporter from The New York Times during a campaign rally, Streep labeled it one performance in the past year that \"stunned\" her. There was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can't get it of out my head, because it wasn't in a movie. It was real life. And this instinct to humiliate, when it's modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody's life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Article continues after sponsorship 11 Times Donald Trump Looked Like He Was Done For In what The New York Times described as a brief telephone interview early Monday morning, Trump said he had not watched Streep's remarks. But Trump said he was not surprised he had been criticized by \"liberal movie people,\" and dismissed Streep as a Hillary Clinton supporter. Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 Trump also denied, as he frequently has, that he intended to mock Times reporter Serge Kovaleski for his disability, the incident to which Streep was apparently referring. Just a few hours later, Trump reiterated his remarks to the Times in a trio of tweets. Streep also urged the audience to support the Committee to Protect Journalists to preserve an independent press, and specifically outlined the wide and varied birthplaces of many Golden Globe nominees and winners. \"Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners,\" she said. \"And if we kick 'em all out you'll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.\" Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never \"mocked\" a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him....... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 Streep wasn't the only one to take on the president-elect less than two weeks before his inauguration. Host Jimmy Fallon joked at the show's start that the Golden Globes were \"one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote.\" While accepting the award for best supporting actor in a limited TV series, The Night Manager co-star Hugh Laurie joked it would be the last Golden Globes ceremony, because the awards are chosen by an association with the words \"Hollywood,\" \"foreign\" and \"press\" in the title \u2013 groups Trump has criticized in the past. \"groveling\" when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 These barbs capped an evening in which the Hollywood Foreign Press Association championed the musical film La La Land, handing it a record seven awards, including best director for Damien Chazelle, best actor in a musical or comedy for Ryan Gosling and best actress in a musical or comedy for Emma Stone.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic Mr. Kushner has been described by numerous transition staff members as the first among equals in Mr. Trump\u2019s high command. His new title belies the sweeping influence he will have behind the scenes. The soft-spoken Mr. Kushner has often been described as having a calming effect on Mr. Trump, who is notorious for yelling at staff members during moments of tension. Mr. Kushner became the de facto campaign manager in the spring, and his influence with Mr. Trump has expanded rapidly. He is expected to play the same role in the White House, while the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, provides the president-elect with strategic, messaging and communications advice, and Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and the incoming chief of staff, runs day-to-day operations in the West Wing. Mr. Trump\u2019s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, will have a direct line to the president on a range of issues. Despite his lack of hands-on political experience before the 2016 campaign, Mr. Kushner earned the trust of his mercurial father-in-law during the campaign\u2019s most turbulent moments, joining his wife and Mr. Trump\u2019s adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., in ousting Corey Lewandowski, then the campaign manager, in the heat of the primary season. Mr. Kushner was among those who pushed, campaign officials said, for the removal of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, and pressed for his father-in-law to appoint David M. Friedman, a Long Island lawyer, as ambassador to Israel. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Kushner, an orthodox Jew, has also made an unlikely ally of Mr. Bannon, an icon of the closed-borders nationalist movement. When Mr. Bannon, a former Breitbart executive, came under attack from Democrats after he was appointed to a White House role, Mr. Kushner assured allies that he had complete faith in Mr. Bannon and described him as a man of character. Mr. Kushner will not take a salary and plans to work on issues involving the Middle East and Israel; try to forge government partnerships with the private sector; and collaborate with Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., on matters involving free trade, Ms. Gorelick said. The scion of a prominent Democratic family active in New Jersey politics, Mr. Kushner showed few early signs that he would become a national political power player. A Harvard graduate, he is a lifelong Democrat, liberal on social issues. Like his ideologically limber father-in-law, he has donated to Democratic candidates. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More Mr. Kushner\u2019s appointment was greeted with relief by some liberals, including Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who views him as moderating influence in a Trump West Wing dominated by hard-line conservatives. \u201cI respect him a lot,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said when asked about Mr. Kushner on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for years and find him to be a very reasonable person.\u201d Still, it remains unclear if Mr. Kushner is inclined to prod the president-elect to the left. By his own account, he underwent something of a personal political transformation during the campaign, embracing Mr. Trump\u2019s fiery and conservative economic message after spending months crisscrossing red and swing-state America. Mr. Kushner\u2019s new role became public a day after the disclosure that he would resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, his family\u2019s real estate firm, and divest himself of \u201csubstantial assets,\u201d including 666 Fifth Avenue. Mr. Kushner will divest of his holdings in The Observer and has stepped down as its publisher; his brother-in-law, the newspaper\u2019s chairman, will assume that role. Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday to discuss his plans for dealing with myriad conflicts of interest raised by his sprawling international development, hotel, branding and entertainment empire. Ms. Gorelick said she was confident Mr. Kushner\u2019s appointment would survive any legal challenge, and said Mr. Trump would seek an advisory opinion from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel. \u201cI am not saying there\u2019s no legal argument on the other side,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m just saying we have the better argument and will prevail.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump made it clear since he was elected that he wanted Mr. Kushner in his White House. Since December, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Gorelick\u2019s team have consulted with the Office of Government Ethics to create a plan that would satisfy the legal requirements needed for him to serve. Mr. Kushner\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, a real estate developer who was once imprisoned for tax evasion, will take an increased role in the family company. Norman L. Eisen, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under President Obama, said he thought Mr. Kushner\u2019s decision to divest holdings raised pressure on Mr. Trump to follow suit. \u201cWhat we are seeing now is, after the initial chaos of the Trump transition, that his nominees are now complying with the requirements of the law,\u201d he said. \u201cRex Tillerson has retired from Exxon, and now Kushner is doing the same,\u201d he added, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be hard for Trump to ignore 40 years of precedent and not do the same.\u201d Glenn Thrush reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

    "text": "CBS/AP January 9, 2017, 3:03 PM Dylann Roof offers no defense against death penalty for Charleston church shooting State senator Gerald Malloy (R), testifies in this court sketch at the trial of Dylann Roof, who is facing the death penalty for the hate-fueled killings of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, U.S., January 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Robert Maniscalco Email CHARLESTON, S.C. - After four days of testimony, prosecutors rested their death penalty case Monday against convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof , calling more than two dozen people during the trial\u2019s penalty phase. As he promised earlier in the trial, Roof - who is representing himself - rested his case without calling witnesses or presenting any evidence on his own behalf. \u00a0 Dylann Roof spoke Wednesday to the jury that will decide whether he dies or spends the rest of his life in prison. Roof was convicted of the murd... Most of the testimony consisted of heartwarming stories about each of the nine people Roof killed in the 2015 attack at Emanuel AME Church. Witnesses also talked about the heartrending tales of loss in the wake of the deaths. Roof, 22, was convicted last month on 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of religion. The same jury that found him guilty has been back in court this month, tasked with deciding if he gets the death penalty or life in prison. Roof himself has spoken little during the trial. One important thing that he didn\u2019t say to jurors during his opening statement was that he wanted to be spared the death penalty. Instead, he wanted them to know that he believes he is sane . \u201cMy opening statement is going to seem a little bit out of place,\u201d the soft-spoken 22-year-old white man said calmly as he stood in front of a podium, occasionally glancing at notes. \u201cI am not going to lie to you. ... Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn\u2019t and the fact that I\u2019m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who\u2019s ever existed, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me psychologically.\u201d Roof\u2019s attorneys have indicated that he chose to represent himself during the sentencing phase of his trial because he was worried they might present embarrassing evidence about himself or his family. They have not said what that evidence may be, but as early as last summer, they had planned to introduce evidence that Roof suffers from a mental illness.

But finding out she was pregnant with quadruplets in May \u2014 just a month after going into remission from Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \u2014 was definitely a high point in her life. Kayla Gaytan from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, poses while she\u2019s pregnant with quadruplets. Kayla Gaytan The mother of two from Fort Campbell, Kentucky didn\u2019t think it was possible. She was diagnosed with the blood cancer in January. For three months straight, the 29-year-old had been undergoing chemotherapy treatments. \u201cIt was more than a complete shock, but also such a blessing,\u201d Gaytan told CBS News. \u201cI can remember in the doctor\u2019s office, seeing the four gestational sacs and just being in awe. There before me [were] four healthy babies with four heart beats.\u201d Gaytan did everything possible to ensure her babies stayed healthy, and everything seemed perfect \u2014 until November. At the six-month mark of her pregnancy, Gaytan was told her cancer was back. Her goal was to make it to 34 weeks before having a C-section. \u201cIt was best to take the babies earlier so that I could begin treatment as soon as possible,\u201d Gaytan explained. At 30 weeks, it was time for the babies to come out. On Dec. 30., Gaytan gave birth to four babies \u2014 Michael, Victoria, Charles and Lillian\u2014 each weighing between 2 and 3 pounds at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cThe quads are currently doing well,\u201d Gaytan said. \u201cBeing a week old, I think we\u2019ve gotten most of the scares out of the way.\u201d The babies can all breathe on their own, but occasionally need supplemental oxygen. Kayla Gaytan \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see them grow and to see their little bodies fight to stay strong,\u201d Gaytan said. \u201cI definitely admire their strength already as their mom, it makes me proud.\u201d When the children get older Gaytan hopes they will see her strength as well. \u201cI want my kids to understand when they get older that I fought as hard as I could for them. No matter the outcome at the end,\u201d she said. On Jan. 18, seven days before her 30th birthday, Gaytan will start a new kind of chemotherapy. Then she will undergo a stem cell transplant. \u201cI\u2019m a very stubborn person. I believe that\u2019s part of what has gotten me this far,\u201d Gaytan said. \u201cMy advice to other moms, or anyone really facing cancer or any other challenges in life, is to just have faith. Even when it\u2019s tested, continue to believe that things will work themselves out.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Boodman January 9 at 11:01 AM (Cameron Cottrill for The Washington Post) As Diana Hardeman climbed into a New York City taxi with her boyfriend around midnight on May 31, she suddenly realized she had no idea where to tell the driver to go. The 33-year-old knew she had to get to a hospital \u2014 and fast. Hardeman was fairly sure she had just had a stroke, her second in less than three years. But she had never asked the neurologist she had seen after the first stroke where she should head in the event of a recurrence. Rattled, she opted for the only place she could think of: a large public hospital not far from her apartment. [ For half her life, doctors told her to lose weight. But something else was going on. ] Hardeman emerged from her two-day stay with more questions than answers. Doctors could not determine why the otherwise healthy and unusually fit young woman with no apparent risk factors \u2014 a devotee of yoga, strenuous hikes and marathons \u2014 had suffered strokes in the first place. Hardeman, who owns MilkMade, an artisanal ice cream company in Brooklyn, decided that her life depended on an answer. So far, she had suffered no permanent impairment. Next time, she knew, she might not be so lucky. So she temporarily shuttered her burgeoning business and plunged into an unfamiliar world. Guided by her father, a doctor who specializes in critical care, Hardeman plowed through dense articles in medical journals, sought out a variety of experts and amassed and organized a growing stack of medical records. (TWP) In her case there were options, not absolutes. Ultimately it was up to Hardeman, who has an MBA degree, to weigh the conflicting advice of experts and decide what to do. \u201cI had to become the CEO of my own health,\u201d she said. [ Five simple steps to avoid becoming a medical mystery ] Surfing aftermath A few days before Christmas 2013, Hardeman flew to southern California for the holidays. She spent the morning of Dec. 22 surfing with her father. As she bent down to slather coconut oil on her legs after a shower, Hardeman suddenly felt profoundly weak. Her right arm went numb. Unsure of what was happening, she walked out of the bathroom, sat on the floor of her bedroom and spoke to her boyfriend. \u201cOnly gibberish came out,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first I thought, \u2018Am I dying?\u2019 \u201d she recalled, as she discovered that the right side of her body was paralyzed. Hardeman\u2019s boyfriend telephoned her father, who had just left the house. He immediately returned and called an ambulance. Within 20 minutes, Hardeman, whose speech by then had returned to normal, was in the emergency room of the hospital where her father works. Forty-five minutes later, she received tPA , a drug used to treat ischemic strokes (those caused by a blood clot rather than a ruptured blood vessel in the brain), which must be administered within about three hours of an event. \u201cI was very lucky I was at my dad\u2019s hospital, which is a stroke center ,\u201d she said, referring to institutions specially certified to treat acute strokes. [ Strokes in young adults rise, troubling doctors and researchers ] Hardeman was discharged on Christmas Day. Most of the feeling on her right side had returned, but some weakness lingered for several weeks. After many tests, doctors had trouble identifying the exact cause of Hardeman\u2019s strokes. (Courtesy of Diana Hardeman) Doctors had ruled out common causes of a stroke, including deep vein thrombosis , a blood clot that often forms in the legs. They discovered that Hardeman had a common heart defect called a PFO, or patent foramen ovale , a small hole in the wall between the two top chambers of the heart. The hole, present during fetal development, is supposed to close after birth, but sometimes doesn\u2019t. The condition is shared by an estimated 20 to 30 percent of the population and rarely causes problems; most people are unaware of it. Tests also revealed that Hardeman had actually suffered two small strokes in different parts of the brain. Doctors decided that they appeared to be the result of a tiny tear in her left carotid artery , which supplies blood to the brain. These tears can occur as a result of physical activity as the neck is hyperextended. Yoga, surfing, chiropractic ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion or even having one\u2019s hair washed at a salon (dubbed \u201cthe beauty parlor stroke\u201d) are known to cause such tears. Hardeman thought she might have suffered a tear as a result of her contorted position on a cramped cross-country flight several days earlier. She said she had awakened from a nap to find her head tilted to the left at an odd angle. Doctors advised Hardeman to take aspirin and a blood thinner to prevent another stroke and to avoid exercise, including yoga, until further notice. Back in New York, she consulted a neurologist, who advised her to continue taking medication. After a scan in February revealed nothing amiss involving her carotid artery, the neurologist cleared her to resume running and yoga. Within a few months, Hardeman said, she \u201cfelt great.\u201d She continued taking a daily low-dose aspirin as a precaution. After three months on a blood thinner, she was told she no longer needed it. \u201cI felt very grateful about how this had all turned out,\u201d she said. The ice cream business she had started in her apartment several years earlier was flourishing. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, this was just a fluke.\u2019 I had gotten over the trepidation that this would happen again.\u201d And then it did. [ Medical errors now third leading cause of death in United States ] \u2018It\u2019s happening again\u2019 Around midnight last May 31, as Hardeman leaned over to plug in her computer, she felt a sudden weakness on her right side. Her face drooped and her speech was unintelligible. \u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s happening again,\u201d she remembers thinking. Within 10 minutes she had recovered speech and sensation, and was in the cab en route to the hospital. Testing revealed this episode to be less serious than the first. Hardeman did not receive tPA because she had recovered by the time she reached the ER. The second stroke puzzled the hospital team, who examined the records from the first, which Hardeman\u2019s boyfriend brought in the next day at her request. They were skeptical that Hardeman had ever suffered an arterial tear the first time \u2014 there was no visible evidence on scans \u2014 and classified her stroke as cryptogenic , meaning its cause was unknown. Cryptogenic strokes affect about 200,000 Americans younger than 55 each year. Among the causes are atrial fibrillation , an irregular heartbeat; inherited blood clotting disorders; and a PFO. Doctors advised Hardeman to follow up with her neurologist in an attempt to pinpoint the cause. The neurologist prescribed the blood thinner Hardeman requested at the suggestion of her father, and referred her to a hematologist and a cardiologist. To weigh the conflicting advice of experts, Diana Hardeman says, \u201cI had to become the CEO of my own health.\u201d (Courtesy of Diana Hardeman) Tests revealed a previously unknown condition: May-Thurner syndrome , a disorder in which a leg vein is compressed, promoting the development of problem clots. But specialists did not know whether this finding was unrelated to Hardeman\u2019s strokes or had helped cause them. The same was true of the PFO. Hardeman\u2019s father contacted a prominent neurologist in Philadelphia with expertise in treating cryptogenic strokes; he agreed to see her for a second opinion. [ Doctors dismissed his pain as migraines. Then they said he had 24 hours to live. ] The specialist recommended that she continue with her medication and strongly advised against an option that had been raised by another doctor: a procedure to close the hole. For years that had meant open heart surgery. But in the past 15 years, an outpatient endovascular procedure \u2014 in which a catheter containing miniature instruments is inserted into a blood vessel \u2014 has become popular. Experts are divided about its safety and effectiveness and whether it is superior to medication alone. \u201cI was really worried,\u201d Hardeman recalled. \u201cI kept wondering, \u2018Am I going to be able to have kids? Am I going to be okay?\u2019 \u201d She wasn\u2019t sure whether the procedure was the best option or whether it posed an unnecessary risk . Nor was there any consensus about what had caused her strokes in the first place. Buffeted by contradictory advice, Hardeman contacted another expert, Carolyn Brockington , director of the stroke center at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital. Hardeman had met the vascular neurologist in 2014, when both appeared on a segment of the \u201cDr. Oz\u201d TV show about young women and stroke. \u201c \u2018We\u2019re going to close the loop,\u2019 \u201d Hardeman recalled Brockington telling her, which she found reassuring. Brockington said she suspected the strokes were caused by the PFO. A new explanation \u201cShe had both episodes after she leaned down,\u201d Brockington explained. \u201cWhen you lean down, you change the pressure in your thorax,\u201d which can force a clot through the hole in the heart and into the brain, triggering a stroke. It was not clear whether Hardeman was at high risk for the development of problem clots because of her newly identified vein compression. \u201cTypically the treatment for a PFO is a blood thinner,\u201d Brockington said. But medication alone had not prevented a recurrence, and two strokes in a short period put Hardeman at risk for a recurrence. Brockington recommended that Hardeman undergo the closure procedure, echoing a vascular surgeon at another hospital whom Hardeman had consulted. Complications can include an irregular heartbeat and a tear in the heart or blood vessels. After conferring with her father, Hardeman decided it was worth the risk. In mid-August, an interventional cardiologist threaded a catheter through a large vein in Hardeman\u2019s groin to install a hole-plugging device in her heart. Sedated but conscious, she watched the procedure on a monitor and went home three hours later. She now takes a daily aspirin and will continue on a blood thinner for several more months. To Brockington, Hardeman\u2019s case underscores the importance of having stroke survivors consult a vascular neurologist who specializes in the treatment of stroke, not a general neurologist. Hardeman said she feels fine and is immersed in expanding her business. The three months she spent sorting out her health, she added, taught her a lot. While having a father who is a physician was invaluable, it ultimately fell to her to keep pushing for an answer and to decide what to do. \u201cI learned that I was the one who had to lead the case,\u201d she said. \u201cThe onus was totally on me to share information among doctors at different hospitals who had no ability to share records.\u201d \u201cDoctors don\u2019t say, \u2018Here\u2019s what you do,\u2019 \u201d she observed. \u201cThere are possibilities, not certainties. \u201d Submit your solved medical mystery to sandra.boodman@washpost.com .

Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, has ties to anti-immigration groups dating back decades. (Jim Lo Scalzo / European Pressphoto Agency) Joseph Tanfani Contact Reporter When federal prosecutors came to San Diego for conferences in the 1980s, the U.S. attorney there, Peter Nu\u00f1ez, would invite them to the border to survey the chaotic conditions. \u201cNo fences, few lights, no cameras. Thousands of illegal aliens coming across the border,\u201d he recalled last week.\u00a0 One person who went along, he said, was Jeff Sessions , then U.S. attorney for the southern district of Alabama.\u00a0The two men bonded over a shared belief that too many people were immigrating to America \u2014 whether they jumped the border or entered legally. Eventually, Nu\u00f1ez\u00a0became board chairman of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that\u00a0pushes for strict curbs on immigration. Sessions went on to be elected senator from Alabama and will sit\u00a0Tuesday for the start of his two-day Senate confirmation hearing as President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s choice to be attorney general.\u00a0 Already well known as the Senate\u2019s fiercest opponent of immigration, Sessions holds views shaped\u00a0in part as he forged close ties over several decades to the Center for Immigration Studies\u00a0and two other\u00a0groups with similar agendas, NumbersUSA and the Federation for American Immigration Reform. With Sessions poised to be\u00a0an influential voice on immigration policy in the Trump administration, these formerly fringe groups have their best chance yet to see\u00a0Washington policy turn decisively in their direction. Jeff Denham has been at odds with his own party\u2019s leadership on immigration reform before, but he's trying again with this Congress , hoping a single comment from the president-elect is a sign his idea might have a chance.

Jeff Denham has been at odds with his own party\u2019s leadership on immigration reform before, but he's trying again with this Congress , hoping a single comment from the president-elect is a sign his idea might have a chance. The Turlock Republican wants Congress to allow people who were brought... (Sarah D. Wire) \"He's going to do great,\u201d Trump said Monday of Sessions, dismissing any possible concerns over his confirmation. \u201cHigh-quality man.\" Roy Beck,\u00a0president of NumbersUSA, which organizes grass-roots opposition to pro-immigration measures,\u00a0said he recognized a kindred spirit in Sessions when he first visited him in his Senate office in the 1990s. \u201cYou\u2019re always looking for the people who understand that legal immigration has to be kept down,\u201d Beck said, adding that Sessions immediately agreed with Numbers\u2019 argument \u00a0that more immigrants hurt American workers. \u201cHe\u2019s kept that flame alive. We now have the chief cheerleader for [that viewpoint] as attorney general.\u201d The organizations have pushed for uncompromising enforcement, and oppose attempts to provide legal status for people in the U.S. illegally. Their ultimate goal, though, is not just to lock down the border, but to dramatically reduce the numbers of immigrants coming to the U.S. Sessions plunged into his crucial role in the movement when he helped lead the opposition to the 2007 immigration reform bill supported by former President George W. Bush, which ultimately failed in the Senate. \u201cNo one played a more important and public role in defeating it,\u201d the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which presented Sessions with an award for his work against the legislation,\u00a0wrote in its newsletter. \u201cLike a grand master chess player, Sessions devised strategy after strategy to block, thwart, delay and ultimately defeat the bill.\u201d Since then, Sessions has visited the federation\u2019s annual Hold Their Feet to the Fire\u00a0meeting \u00a0that rallies conservative activists to oppose immigration. In 2013, Sessions worked again to derail another bill to reform the immigration system. A lawyer for the Center for Immigration Studies went to work for him on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Sessions ran the immigration subcommittee, on rallying opposition to the measure; it passed the Senate but never came up for a vote in the House. \u201cWe were the spearhead of work during that legislation,\u201d said the attorney, Janice Kephart, adding that Sessions was \u201cextremely demanding\u201d in insisting that staff analyze the entire 1,700-page bill. \u201cThe thing for him on lower immigration really has to do with keeping jobs in America. He did stand out in ways that ticked off his fellow Republicans at times.\u201d\u00a0 In fighting\u00a0against the two bills, many Republicans talked about the rule of law and securing borders. But few went as far as Sessions, who\u00a0adopted the populist arguments of the restrictionist groups, saying that pro-immigration business interests were selling out unskilled American workers. He also sided with the groups after Republican leaders\u00a0wrote a report examining the GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential election loss and argued that the party was doomed unless it embraced immigration reform and increased the party\u2019s standing with Latinos.\u00a0Sessions spoke out on behalf of people who opposed immigration as a threat to their way of living, a precursor to Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cThis election \u2026 was lost because millions of dutiful Americans didn\u2019t think we cared enough about people like them,\u201d Sessions said in a 2013 speech to a far-right\u00a0group, the David Horowitz Freedom\u00a0Center. \u201cIs it going to help their children find a job if we legalize 10 million people? I don\u2019t think so. The Chamber of Commerce isn\u2019t very concerned about that.\u201d Little economic evidence exists showing that more immigration pushes down wages or cost Americans jobs, according advocates for a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. They say those views are often a smokescreen to conceal a racially driven anti-immigrant agenda. All three groups trace their heritage in part to John Tanton, a Michigan ophthalmologist and population control advocate who sought to create a network of policy organizations to push the cause of immigration restriction. Tanton, who is still listed on the Federation for American Immigration Reform\u2019s board of advisors, also wrote about the threat immigrants posed to the \u201cEuropean American\u201d majority values. Group representatives say the charge of racism is a canard to distract from a debate about proper immigration levels. The Center for Immigration Studies\u00a0no longer has anything to do with Tanton or white supremacists, said\u00a0Mark Krikorian, its executive director. \u201cHe had a tin ear and no real familiarity with how this issue rankles some people,\u201d Krikorian said of Tanton. \u201cHe\u2019s their hate figure and has given them some ammunition for it.\u201d Beck has said NumbersUSA has not had ties to Tanton since 2002.\u00a0 The Senate should \"hold Sessions accountable\" for his long alliance with the anti-immigration groups, Lynn Tramonte\u00a0of America\u2019s Voice, a group that advocates for a path to citizenship for immigrants here illegally, said in an email. \u00a0\u201cAmericans deserve to have a\u00a0a full and public airing of Sessions\u2019 relationship with extremist organizations as part of this process.\u201d As attorney general, Sessions would have a great deal of influence over immigration issues. Immigration courts would be under his control, and he could instruct prosecutors to file more charges against border crossers and press so-called sanctuary cities\u00a0to end policies of refusing to cooperate with federal immigration law enforcement.\u00a0 Sessions\u2019 allies in the immigration control groups are hoping that he goes further, including measures that are likely to make more pro-business\u00a0Republicans squirm. Beck said he would like to see Sessions ramp up prosecutions of company owners who hire immigrants in the U.S. illegally. \u201cHe knows that if these businesses were not hiring an illegal labor force, we would not have hardly any illegal immigration,\u201d Beck said. Sessions, as well as Trump, has joined the groups in arguing against birthright citizenship and what they call \u201cchain migration,\u201d in which one family member sponsors others to come to the U.S. Questioning of birthright citizenship, which was granted by the 14th Amendment, alarms civil rights lawyers. \u201cHis legal views on civil rights and immigration law are reactionary,\u201d said Joanne Lin, senior legal counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, adding that the attorney general\u2019s job is to \u201cinterpret and enforce the Constitution.\u201d \u201cIt would seek to overturn 150 years of constitutional history and move the country back to the time of the Civil War.\u201d For immigrant advocates, the larger question is how much influence Sessions will wield in the new Trump administration. Sessions endorsed Trump early and helped shape Trump\u2019s own anti-free trade, build-a-wall message that helped him win over working-class voters in states that have suffered from lost manufacturing jobs. Stephen Miller, a longtime Sessions aide who worked on the senator\u2019s immigration initiatives, joined the Trump campaign early last year and will be a\u00a0senior advisor to Trump. The restrictionists were also cheered when Andrew Puzder, Trump\u2019s pro-immigration nominee for Labor secretary, said he would support Trump\u2019s agenda. But Trump has proved\u00a0willing\u00a0to ignore even his closest advisors when it suits him, and Sessions\u2019 support might not be enough to cement anti-immigration groups\u2019 views into policy. \u201cIt will be interesting to see just what the administration does to accommodate these people,\u201d said Liz Mair, a Republican consultant who has worked on immigration reform. \u201cI just don\u2019t know that Trump sees the world the same way they do.\u201d Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

Josh King reports. Buzz60 A radiologist compares an image from earlier, 2-D technology mammogram to the new 3-D Digital Breast Tomosynthesis mammography in Wichita Falls, Texas. (Photo: Torin Halsey, Wichita Falls Times Record News, via AP) One in three women with breast cancer detected by a mammogram are\u00a0treated unnecessarily, \u00a0according to a\u00a0 Danish study \u00a0published Monday in\u00a0Annals of Internal Medicine, which has\u00a0renewed debate over the value of early detection. The women didn\u2019t need treatment, researchers write, because they had tumors so slow-growing that they\u2019re essentially harmless. The study raises the uncomfortable possibility that some women who believe their lives were saved by mammograms were actually harmed by cancer screenings that led to surgery, radiation and even chemotherapy that they didn\u2019t need, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, who wrote an\u00a0 accompanying editorial \u00a0but was not involved in the study. Researchers increasingly recognize that not all breast cancers pose the same risk, even if they look the same under a microscope, Brawley said. While some early tumors turn into deadly monsters, others stop growing or even shrink. But assuming that all small breast lesions have the potential to turn deadly is akin to \u201cracial profiling,\u201d Brawley wrote in his editorial. \u201cBy treating all the cancers that we see, we are clearly saving some lives,\u201d Brawley said in an interview. \u201cBut we\u2019re also \u2018curing\u2019 some women who don\u2019t need to be cured.\u201d Although experts such as Brawley have long discussed the risks posed by\u00a0 \u201coverdiagnosis,\u201d \u00a0relatively few women who undergo cancer screenings are even aware of the debate. The American College of Radiology, which strongly supports breast cancer screenings, acknowledges that mammograms lead some women to be treated unnecessarily\u00a0but said the problem is much less common than the new study suggests.\u00a0 Another study from Denmark \u00a0\u2013 whose national health program keeps detailed records \u2013 estimated the overdiagnosis rates at only 2.3%. \u201cThe amount of overdiagnosis really is small,\u201d said Dr. Debra Monticciolo, chair of the American College of Radiology\u2019s Commission on Breast Imaging. \u201cArticles like this aren\u2019t very helpful,\u201d she said, because they leave women confused about how to be screened for breast cancer. Yet treating women for cancer unnecessarily can endanger their health, said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group. Radiation\u00a0 can damage the heart \u00a0or\u00a0 even cause new cancers. \u00a0Visco notes that breast cancer activist\u00a0 Carolina Hinestrosa , a vice president at the coalition, died at age 50 from soft-tissue sarcoma, a tumor caused by radiation used to treat an early breast cancer. Women should understand these risks, Visco said. Instead, women often hear only about mammograms\u2019 benefits. \u201cWomen have been inundated with the early detection message for decades,\u201d Visco said. The risks of overdiagnosis and false positives, which can lead women with benign growths to undergo biopsies and other follow-up tests, have caused some experts to re-evaluate breast cancer screenings.\u00a0Although mammograms don\u2019t find all tumors, they reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by 25%\u00a0to 31%\u00a0for women ages 40 to 69, according to the\u00a0 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , part of the Department of Health and Human Services. Medical groups now offer differing advice on mammograms: The\u00a0 American College of Radiology \u00a0takes the most aggressive stance, recommending annual mammograms\u00a0 beginning at age 40. \u00a0Tumors should be found when they\u2019re \u201csmaller and easier to treat,\u201d Monticciolo said. The\u00a0 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, \u00a0an independent expert panel that advises the federal government on health, provoked a firestorm of criticism in 2009 when it bucked that advice, recommending that women get mammograms every other year beginning at age 50. The group noted that breast cancer risk rises with age, so mammograms are more likely to discover cancer \u2013 as opposed to benign growths \u2013 after age 50. The American Cancer Society also scaled back its screening advice in 2015, recommending women\u00a0 get annual mammograms from 45 to 54 , followed by screenings every other year after that. In the new study, Danish researchers estimated the rate of overdiagnosis by comparing the number of early-stage and advanced breast tumors before and after the country started offering mammograms. If screenings work as intended, the number of small, curable breast tumors should increase, while reducing the number of large cancers by about the same amount. Although mammograms in Denmark detected a lot more breast cancers, these were mostly small, early-stage tumors, said study co-author Dr. Karsten Jorgensen, a researcher at the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen, Denmark. The number of advanced cancers did not fall. The debate about overdiagnosis illustrates the limits of medical technology, Brawley said. Although researchers can estimate the statistical rate of overdiagnosis, doctors treating actual patients can\u2019t definitively tell which breast tumors need treatment and which might be safely ignored, Brawley said. So doctors tend to err on the side of caution and treat all breast cancers with surgery and, in many cases, radiation and chemotherapy. An estimated 253,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in U.S. women this year, with nearly 41,000 deaths, according to the\u00a0 American Cancer Society . An additional 63,000 women will be diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, also known as DCIS, which has some, but not all, of the typical traits of cancer. Although DCIS cells have changed to appear malignant under the microscope, they haven\u2019t invaded surrounding tissue. The American Cancer Society defines DCIS as the earliest stage of breast cancer, and women with the condition typically undergo the same treatment given to women with early invasive cancers. Although DCIS isn\u2019t life-threatening, doctors recommend treating it to prevent it from becoming invasive. Other experts \u00a0note that DCIS carries such low risk that it should be considered merely a risk factor for cancer. Researchers are conducting studies to measure whether it\u2019s safe to scale back treatment of DCIS.

AP Two law enforcement officers have been killed during a massive manhunt for a murder suspect in Orlando, Fla. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton radioed from a Wal-Mart shortly after 7 a.m. Monday, saying she was \"attempting to contact a murder suspect,\" according to a statement from the City of Orlando . Other officers radioed two minutes later, reporting that an officer had been shot. The 17-year veteran of the department died after she was transported to a hospital. Police are seeking Markeith Loyd in the murder of a pregnant woman named Sade Dixon last month. Loyd fled from the Wal-Mart and pulled into a nearby apartment building, where police say he fired shots at a sheriff's deputy but did not harm him. Loyd then allegedly stole a car and escaped. This put a manhunt into motion for the suspect, described as \"armed and extremely dangerous.\" During the search, authorities say, a sheriff's deputy riding a motorcycle was hit by a car and later died. The deputy has been identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, an 11-year-veteran of the force . Article continues after sponsorship \"This is probably one of the toughest days for me in my career,\" Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told reporters . \"Because not only did we lose an Orlando police officer today, we lost an Orange County deputy sheriff as well who was traveling on his motorcycle as a result of these broad efforts that we have underway.\" Sheriff: We are highly motivated to bring this suspect to justice. We will stay on it until suspect is caught. pic.twitter.com/NcvJt5AnSY \u2014 OCSO FL News (@OrangeCoSheriff) January 9, 2017 Law enforcement is \"highly motivated to bring this suspect to justice,\" the sheriff said . There is a reward of up to $60,000 for information about the 41-year-old Loyd. The Orlando Police Department says Clayton was married with a son. \"She was extremely committed to our youth and really, the community,\" Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters . \"And she did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself \u2014 that's how committed she is.\" The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted that Lewis was a \"gentle giant\" with a \"million dollar smile.\" In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, \"These tragic deaths make clear the great risks that our brave men and women in uniform face each and every day, and the deep and abiding gratitude that our nation owes them for their service.\" ",

Lawyers for the accusers are set to announce the new case against Nassar, who treated America's top gymnasts for years, at a press conference Tuesday in Michigan. Although Nassar traveled widely as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics, he had a sports medicine practice at Michigan State University, which will also be named in the federal lawsuit.

Since then, up to 60 ex-patients have filed police complaints against the physician. Three of them have filed lawsuits against Nassar and USA Gymnastics or Nassar and MSU in state court in California. In November, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, who took over the investigation, filed charges against Nassar, alleging that he molested a family friend for years, starting when she was 6 years old. Then, last month, federal prosecutors charged Nassar, 53, with possession of child pornography, and an FBI agent testified that tens of thousands of images were found on disks and drives discovered in a trash can outside his house and inside his home. Related: USA Gymnastics Doctor Charged With Child Porn The cache included video from a GoPro that Nassar took as he was swimming in a pool; it shows him grabbing and penetrating the genitals of at least two girls, and groping and pulling down the tops of others. \"Any case involving child pornography is, of course, serious,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean Lewis said during the hearing. \"But here the defendant has shown through his conduct that he's a hands-on offender.

And it's not just conduct that happened a while ago and he'd moved on. It's conduct that's continued to this year.\" Magistrate Judge Raymond Kent ordered Nassar held without bail, not because he is a flight risk, but because he considers him a danger. \"If the testimony of Agent Charles is accurate, Dr. Nassar poses the worst kind of risk to our community: a risk to our children, Kent said. \"We simply can't have somebody like him free in the community with access to children as young as six years old.\" Related: USA Gymnastics Opens Sex-Abuse Review Nassar has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His attorneys have not addressed the pornography charges but have said that any \"procedures\" he performed on patients were medical in nature. The lawsuits filed so far have alleged that USA Gymnastics, famed coaches Bela and Marta Karolyi and Michigan State turned a blind eye to Nassar's alleged abuse. MSU fired Nassar this fall, saying an investigation showed he had not complied with requirements to use gloves and a chaperone during intravaginal treatments \u2014 rules that were put in place after a 2014 complaint from a patient that prosecutors declined to pursue. The university said it could not comment on the federal lawsuit because it had not yet been filed but said in statement that school officials are \"deeply disturbed\" by the charges and the case is a \"top priority\" for MSU police. \"Our hearts go out to those directly affected,\" the statement said. An internal review is still underway, and the school is examining whether changes are needed in clinic policies and operations. \"MSU at this time has found no indication of any reports against Larry Nassar alleging sexual assault being made prior to the complaint MSU investigated immediately in spring 2014,\" the university said. USA Gymnastics, the governing body for the sport, said it fired Nassar in the summer of 2015 in response to unspecified athlete \"concerns,\" and reported him to the FBI. It's unknown what action was taken at that time, but MSU has said USA Gymnastics did not report its concerns to the university. Tracy Connor ",

    "text": "CBS/AP January 9, 2017, 2:25 PM Do \"weekend warriors\" reap the full benefits of exercise? Email Weekend warriors, take a victory lap. People who pack their workouts into one or two sessions a week lower their risk of dying \u00a0over roughly the next decade nearly as much as people who exercise more often, new research suggests. Even people who get less exercise than recommended have less risk than folks who don\u2019t break a sweat at all. \u201cIf someone is completely inactive, the best thing they can do is even getting out and taking a walk,\u201d said Hannah Arem, a health researcher at George Washington University. For people who think they don\u2019t have enough time for small amounts of exercise to matter, the results are \u201cencouraging or perhaps motivating,\u201d she said. She had no role in the study, but wrote a commentary published with the results Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. U.S. and global guidelines call for 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week, ideally spread out so you get some on most days. A new book explains the science of aging. \"The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer\" claims that puttin... That\u2019s based on many previous studies suggesting a host of benefits beyond the risk of premature death that the new study measured. Researchers at Loughborough University in England used surveys by trained interviewers on nearly 64,000 adults in England and Scotland from 1994 to 2008. By last year, 8,802 had died. Participants were grouped according to how much exercise they said they got the preceding month: Inactive (no leisure time exercise), 63 percent. Regular exercisers (meet the guidelines), 11 percent. Weekend warriors (get the recommended weekly amount but in one or two sessions), 4 percent. Insufficiently active (get less than the recommended weekly amount), 22 percent. The results showed that the risk of dying was about 30 percent lower in weekend warriors and insufficient exercisers versus those who were inactive. Regular exercisers lowered their risk a little more, by 35 percent. Any amount of activity helped cut the risk of dying of heart disease by about 40 percent, compared to being a couch potato. Georgia Kopani, an elementary school teacher, is a so-called weekend warrior - cramming all her exercise into one or two monster workouts. She spends two hours a week at her local gym, working up a sweat. But the rest of the time, not so much, reports CBS News\u2019 chief medical correspondent Dr. Jonathan LaPook.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Kopani said, because the only thing you want after a long day is \u201cto go and just sit down and rest.\u201d She hired New York Sports Club trainer Stephen Ferguson to get her off the couch. \u201cI\u2019m not getting sick so often. I feel better with my body. My confidence is better,\u201d Kopani said. \u201cI feel healthier.\u201d\u00a0 Georgia Kopani, an elementary school teacher, is a so-called weekend warrior. CBS Evening News The new research doesn\u2019t mean that existing guidelines are bunk, independent experts say. Exercise has many other benefits such as helping to prevent dementia, depression, high blood pressure, unhealthy sleep patterns and diabetes . Some of these effects are short-lived, so exercising more often gives more of them, Arem said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019re ready to say, based on this study, that people shouldn\u2019t try to exercise more than that if they can,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Rader, preventive cardiology chief at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cPeople who exercise more regularly report that they feel like they have a better quality of life,\u201d among other benefits, he said.

Grand Ave., Monday, Jan. 9, 2017. David Axelrod speaks about working with President Barack Obama at the City Club of Chicago gathering at Maggiano's Banquets, 111 W. Grand Ave., Monday, Jan. 9, 2017. (Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy President Barack Obama 's longtime political strategist David Axelrod took an oratorical stroll down White House memory lane Monday in a Chicago speech the day before the president's farewell address at McCormick Place. The veteran Democratic operative also used the opportunity to offer his analysis of the incoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump and the lack of bipartisan cooperation in Washington. In a question-and-answer session following a City Club of Chicago address, Axelrod said Trump's lack of true political philosophy has created a vacuum that congressional Republicans appear poised to fill by pushing their top issues. \"I think that what Republicans have figured out is that there are not a lot of philosophical things that this new president cares about,\" Axelrod said as some in the audience laughed. \"He's not sitting there mulling over his multiplicity of ideas about how to improve the country. So, they see in the absence of that to pass stuff they want to pass, a very deep tax cut, deregulation, the Obamacare repeal.\" The former Obama senior adviser also said \"it's not love that binds a lot of Republican politicians to Donald Trump,\" and noted that the president-elect's propensity to confront various businesses through his Twitter feed could rankle many free-market conservatives as his presidency develops. Asked for his advice to Democrats in Washington, Axelrod cautioned against taking a similar obstructionist path that Republicans on Capitol Hill deployed during Obama's presidency. Further erosion of public faith in government, he said, will impact the philosophy of Democrats the most. So he advised Democrats to fight Trump on principles but not to advocate for legislative gridlock. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The effort was slow going. Growing up under the shadow of Jim Crow, African-Americans remained wary of exercising political power, fearing repercussions from white landowners and employers. In the \u201960s, Turner and his wife, Evelyn, along with other activists, formed the Perry County Civic League, which provided food and medicine to rural residents, who were among the state\u2019s poorest, as well as helping them register to vote. Gradually, in Perry and other counties where the black population was 60 percent or higher, black candidates started to run for office, some with the league\u2019s support. But by the early 1980s, a local group, Concerned Citizens of Perry County, and a branch of the White Citizens Council, historically a white supremacist network , were working against Turner\u2019s group to elect what they called a \u201ccoalition\u201d of white and black candidates. A handbill from nearby Greene County urged voters to \u201csupport good, responsible blacks\u201d to defeat \u201cthe radical forces of the black front.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story In Perry County, the polls were only open for four hours in the afternoon, even though nearly one-third of adults worked outside the county and another 15 percent were over the age of 65. White voters used absentee balloting to keep their level of participation high among local residents and also to include some who had moved away. \u201cLetters would go out from white elected officials to a list of people they knew who owned land locally but lived elsewhere: \u2018Make sure you vote absentee,\u2019\u201d says Allen Tullos, a historian at Emory University who has written about the Turner case . \u201cThe white power structure felt under siege, so there was a sense of \u2018We\u2019ve got to call in our friends and families to roll this back.\u2019\u201d Concerned about white absentee voting from afar, black leaders sent Turner to Washington, to complain to lawyers at the Justice Department, whose job was to enforce the Voting Rights Act. \u201cThey said, \u2018We can\u2019t do anything,\u2019\u201d Sanders remembers. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a gray area in the law. Y\u2019all need to learn to use the absentee-ballot process yourselves.\u2019\u201d Turner did so, attending workshops in the Alabama attorney general\u2019s office in hopes of increasing turnout among local rural black voters. \u201cOnce I learned myself, then it was my job to go out through the area and teach the rest of the counties how the law worked,\u201d he later testified before Congress. The activists started visiting people at home, helping them fill out their ballots and mailing them. In 1982, his work paid off. The number of black absentee voters rose, and in Perry, Greene and three other counties in the Black Belt, black candidates, including those supported by Turner\u2019s group, won majorities on the school board and county commissions. After the election, the local district attorney convened a grand jury to investigate absentee balloting, focusing only on black voters aided by Turner\u2019s group. The grand jury did not indict anyone. In September 1984, before primary elections, the district attorney and a black candidate from the black-and-white coalition asked for a federal investigation by the United States attorney for Southern Alabama \u2014 Jeff Sessions. Federal prosecutors have enormous discretion over which cases to bring. It\u2019s not clear why a fight among county politicians would have interested them, absent the larger shift in the Black Belt\u2019s racial dynamics. The night before the primary, Sessions stationed an F.B.I. agent outside the Perry County post office. The agent saw Albert and Evelyn Turner and a third activist, Spencer Hogue, mailing hundreds of absentee ballots. The F.B.I. opened the ballots and found 75 with candidate votes they suspected had been erased or re-marked. The government later lowered the number of disputed ballots to 27, but they still sparked a giant investigation. Ten F.B.I. agents fanned out, interviewing more than 1,000 residents about whether they could read or write, whether anyone helped them vote and whether they had altered their own ballots. The Black Belt includes 10 or so counties; the F.B.I. concentrated on the five in which black voters were making strides toward political ascendance. And in each of the five counties, the government targeted longtime black activists and political leaders \u2014 figures like Turner. In October, as part of the investigation and before the general election, Sessions\u2019s office convened a federal grand jury more than 160 miles south, in Mobile, where the jury pool included more white people. Surrounded by F.B.I. agents and police with guns, about 20 black voters from Perry County, many older and some frail, were taken by bus to Mobile, where they were fingerprinted, photographed and questioned by the grand jury about their votes. \u201cThis was the most degrading thing,\u201d the Rev. O.C. Dobynes, who accompanied the voters on the bus, told Congress a year later. \u201cTo me, it was just simply saying, We are going to scare you into saying what we want you to say.\u201d Asked by a grand juror whether she\u2019d voted absentee for the first time in the September primary, a Perry County resident named Fannie Mae Williams answered: \u201cUh-huh. First and last.\u201d Two other women told the grand jury they were done with voting, according to the book \u201c Lift Every Voice ,\u201d by Lani Guinier, a professor at Harvard Law School. Albert and Evelyn Turner and Spencer Hogue were indicted in January 1985 on 29 counts, for mail fraud, conspiracy to commit voting fraud and voting more than once. Sessions and his assistants claimed the defendants filled out the disputed absentee ballots themselves. Each faced decades in prison. \u201cIt was hell,\u201d remembers Evelyn Turner, now 80. (Her husband died in 2000.) \u201cWe had always helped people with voting, for ages, and they trusted us. Why would you mess with someone\u2019s ballot, if you knew it wasn\u2019t what they wanted? We weren\u2019t fools.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hank Sanders organized a team that included defense lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Southern Poverty Law Center, including Guinier. The Perry case attracted national attention in part because aspects of the prosecution appeared unprecedented. Sessions was the first federal prosecutor to pursue allegations of absentee-voter fraud in a strictly local election, James Liebman, one of the NAACP lawyers, testified to the Senate in 1986, and the first to bring the might of the federal government to bear over a relatively small number of ballots. Liebman also described evidence of absentee-voting irregularities, including altered ballots, on behalf of candidates, both black and white, who were primarily supported by white voters. But Sessions told the Senate that \u201cno evidence was presented to us at that time of fraud by whites, at least anything credible.\u201d Justice Department policy in the 1980s supported bringing election cases \u201conly when federal involvement is either necessary to vindicate paramount federal interests, or as a prosecutor of last resort to redress longstanding patterns of egregious electoral abuse.\u201d Yet the Public Integrity Section of Ronald Reagan\u2019s Justice Department approved Sessions\u2019s case, saying it was not motivated by racial bias. Soon after the F.B.I. staked out the Perry County post office, the United States attorney general issued a statement that seemed related to Sessions\u2019s prosecution: \u201cFederal law prohibits political participants from intentionally seeking out the elderly, the socially disadvantaged or the illiterate for the purpose of subjugating their electoral will.\u201d When the Turners and Hogue went to trial, in June 1985, their supporters came in such numbers that entry to the courtroom in Selma required a ticket. Witness after witness among the 17 voters who testified said that while they\u2019d received assistance from the Turners and Hogue to fill out their ballots, they\u2019d done so willingly. The exceptions were members of a single family of six, who said their ballots were altered without their permission. During the trial, the prosecution adopted an exceptionally broad theory, arguing that it was a crime for a voter to sign a ballot that someone else filled out for him. \u201cEven if the voter authorizes someone to complete the ballot?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cThat is correct,\u201d one of Sessions\u2019s assistants said. The judge ruled that this theory was contrary to election law and the Constitution, and at the close of trial, threw out many of the counts against the Turners and Hogue. They were acquitted of the rest by the jury, which had been picked in Mobile and had seven black members and five white ones. A cheering crowd poured onto the steps of the courthouse. During the last month, Sessions has sought to portray other aspects of his tenure as United States attorney as friendly to civil rights, though the lawyers who did the work in the cases he cited have accused him of exaggerating his role . The Perry County case is a precursor to current Republican claims that voter fraud at the polls is a widespread problem, which Sessions has promoted, even though there is little evidence to support it . Voter-impersonation fraud is a \u201cmyth,\u201d a letter signed by more than 1,200 law professors opposing Sessions\u2019s nomination states. Former Governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who helped defend Spencer Hogue, calls Sessions\u2019s efforts in Perry County a \u201ccautionary tale.\u201d The case, Patrick wrote , \u201cdemonstrates what can happen when prosecutorial discretion is unchecked, when regard for facts is secondary to political objectives.\u201d Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine and the Truman Capote fellow at Yale Law School.

Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes as rivers overflowed their banks. Matt Hamilton , Louis Sahagun , Paige St. John and Soumya Karlamangla Contact Reporters The roaring \u201cPineapple Express\u201d weather system that drenched the northern Sierra Nevada over the weekend has begun to ease, but forecasters warned Monday that it would soon be replaced by yet another storm and plummeting temperatures. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d said Alex Hoon, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service \u2019s Reno station. \u201cThe flooding concerns are going to start going down, but everything\u00a0is going to get a little colder.\u201d The latest\u00a0storm, the third in a series of weather events that have pounded the Sierra Nevada and swollen Central California rivers,\u00a0could bring seven feet of snow in higher elevations and three feet at lower altitudes, according to the National Weather Service. \u201cNow our threat has changed again to heavy amounts of snow, blizzard conditions, white-out conditions and avalanche dangers,\u201d Hoon said. On Monday,\u00a0the weather service\u00a0issued a storm warning for Northern California, western Nevada and southern Oregon for Tuesday through Thursday. During that time, several feet of snow are expected to pile up in high mountain passes and valleys, forecasters said. Already, the storms have boosted seasonal\u00a0rainfall totals\u00a0to levels not seen in years across California, and wreaked havoc on transportation arteries over the rugged Sierra. Forecasters predict this storm will be the region's most powerful in a decade. With additional snow this week, some Sierra Nevada peaks could have received up to 20 feet of snow in the first two weeks of the year, Hoon said. Lake Tahoe and Mammoth Mountain could receive up to 4\u00a0feet of snow by Thursday, and\u00a0higher elevations could see twice that, Hoon said. The people who should be the most concerned are\u00a0residents there and any unlucky motorist\u00a0who has to drive across the mountains. Interstate 80 could be closed, as it was this weekend following a huge mudslide Sunday, Hoon said. The overnight closure on the 80 was lifted\u00a0Monday.\u00a0 Elsewhere in the state, the atmospheric river event caused widespread flooding, downed trees and unleashed mudslides. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re in the heart of our wet season where these storms can happen,\u201d said state climatologist\u00a0Mike Anderson. The storms have dropped enough water that Folsom Reservoir, among others, was forced to release\u00a0water Monday for flood control,\u00a0Anderson said. The back-to-back storms from last week and the weekend have also most certainly helped replenish depleted groundwater basins depleted from years of drought, though the full benefits of the rain won\u2019t be known for some time, he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen an event of this magnitude in at least a decade,\u201d Anderson said. The upcoming storm is colder than the weekend one, meaning it should add more to California\u2019s snowpack, a precious water supply a third of the state relies on in the spring and summer months when it melts. The Sierra Nevada snowpack statewide was at 126% of its average for this time of year on Monday, the California Department of Water Resources stated. Whiteout on U.S. Highway 395 Whiteout conditions caused by blowing snow on U.S.\u00a0395 near Convict Lake, Calif., Monday afternoon. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Whiteout conditions caused by blowing snow on U.S.\u00a0395 near Convict Lake, Calif., Monday afternoon. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) See more videos One of those areas hard-hit by the weekend storm was Yosemite National Park , which closed popular Yosemite Valley over the weekend in anticipation of the Merced River flooding. Though the waters did overwhelm the river, it wasn\u2019t to the degree that park officials anticipated. Yosemite Valley will reopen to the public Tuesday morning, officials said. On Sunday,\u00a0hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes as rivers overflowed their banks. Several key highways including Interstate 80, Interstate 280, U.S. 395 and U.S. 101 were closed for periods because of hazardous conditions. Authorities were trying to determine whether the deaths of three people in the Bay Area \u2014\u00a0one killed by a falling tree, two others by car accidents \u2014\u00a0were related to the storm. In Sonoma County, emergency officials issued voluntary evacuation orders to hundreds of households along the Russian River and the Truckee River in Reno\u00a0as the rivers reached the flood stage.\u00a0 The Truckee River topped its banks, submerging picnic tables on riverside campgrounds along Highway 89 north of Lake Tahoe. Forecasts from the U.S. Geological Survey called for the river to rise another 3 feet, imperiling private bridges to cabins alongside both banks. Along the Russian River, about 650 homes and a handful of businesses in the low-lying areas of Monte Rio and Guerneville were advised to evacuate. County officials expected the river to reach flood stage late Sunday and stay at flood levels through Tuesday. Ten homes in the Carmel Valley were partly flooded late Sunday after a river swelled from the heavy rain, authorities said. ",

Some who were arrested went on hunger strikes, prompting brutal force-feedings that shocked the nation. This was the National Woman\u2019s Party , whose civil disobedience is cited a main force behind the 19th Amendment, which in 1920 gave women a national right to vote. But the party suffered from some of the same segregationist tendencies circulating in society at the time. It took the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s to finally secure black women\u2019s full suffrage . In 1912, W.E.B. Du Bois of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called out the party\u2019s parent group for rejecting black members and associations. The following year, when the anti-lynching journalist Ida B. Wells led a contingent of black suffragists from Chicago to a march in the capital, organizers told them to stay in the rear. Wells declined . She quietly walked alongside two white supporters with the Illinois contingent. Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting. Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.

The destroyer, the USS Mahan, and other U.S. ships were traveling in the narrow Strait of Hormuz, heading into the Persian Gulf, when the incident occurred Sunday. The Iranian craft were 890 yards away from the Mahan when the destroyer fired three rounds of warning shots, after which the Iranian craft backed away from the U.S. ship, the official said. Prior to the shots, the crew of the Mahan made repeated attempts to warn the Iranian craft, including by firing flares from the ship's deck and dropping smoke flares from a helicopter. The defense official said the Iranian craft had contacted the Mahan via radio to ask for its hull number prior to the firing of the shots, then ceased voice communications entirely. However, another defense official told ABC News that after the Iranian craft backed away, they established radio communications with the Mahan to ask its course and speed. \"Naval Forces Central Command assesses this interaction as unsafe and unprofessional due to the IRGCN's [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy] vessels high-speed approach on Mahan with weapons manned and disregard for repeated warnings via radio, audible siren, and ship's whistle, which only arrested following warning shots being fired,\" said Cmdr. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, in a statement. No one was injured in the incident. While close encounters in the Persian Gulf between U.S. Navy ships and Iranian small craft are common, it\u2019s rare that an American ship fires warning shots. The only recent occurrence was in late August in the Persian Gulf when the USS Squall fired warning shots into the waters ahead of an speeding Iranian boat to warn the small craft that it had come as close as 200 yards to a U.S. Navy ship. The Pentagon also called that encounter \"unsafe and unprofessional.\" US Navy Fires Warning Shots at Iranian Boat During a September campaign stop in Florida, Donald Trump addressed Iran 's naval aggression toward the U.S., saying an Iranian craft \"will be shot out of the water.\" \u201cWith Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats, and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water, OK? Believe me,\" Trump told the crowd. In the same speech, Trump promised to expand the U.S. Navy's fleet to 350 ships and to procure \u201cmodern destroyers.\u201d 0 Shares ",

After she defended the story in a testy interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson , Shkreli invited Duca to accompany him to Trump's inauguration. Duca responded by posting Shkreli's offer on Twitter and saying, \"I would rather eat my own organs.\" Shkreli later changed his Twitter profile picture to a digitally edited image in which he appeared to be embracing Duca on a couch. Duca tweeted pictures of the change to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

    "text": "DEC. 30, 2016 By The New York Times Jamie S. Gorelick, a WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration, said that while plans were not final, Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business. \u201cMr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,\u201d she said. He will resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, and though the law does not require it, she said he would divest \u201csubstantial assets.\u201d She did not name them, but Ms. Heller said they would include his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue. Just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen. Mr. Kushner\u2019s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies\u2019 properties, and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 Fifth Avenue. He also has a stake, through a family investment vehicle, in a private equity firm run by his brother, Joshua, with far-flung investments of its own. Mr. Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. Already he is involved in steering policy, making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders, the White House and the president-elect in ways that could affect his business, even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the president-elect\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner played a pivotal role in persuading Mr. Trump, who made the Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs a b\u00eate noire of his presidential campaign, to appoint the firm\u2019s president, Gary D. Cohn , as his chief economic adviser, according to several people involved in the transition. (Like a number of people interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.) Goldman Sachs has lent the Kushner Companies money and is an investor in a real estate technology company co-founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother. Photo A Bank Hapoalim branch in Tel Aviv.

Credit Nir Elias/Reuters Mr. Trump has said that his son-in-law, an Orthodox Jew, will play a central role in dealings with Israel , describing him as so talented that he could help \u201cdo peace in the Middle East.\u201d Mr. Kushner\u2019s company has received multiple loans from Israel\u2019s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim. The incoming Trump administration will inherit a Justice Department investigation into allegations that the bank helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, despite a lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of America\u2019s most complicated diplomatic relationships. Such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention should be relayed through his son-in-law, according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement. So when the Chinese ambassador to the United States called the White House in early December to express what one official called China\u2019s \u201cdeep displeasure\u201d at Mr. Trump\u2019s break with longstanding diplomatic tradition by speaking by phone with the president of Taiwan , the White House did not call the president-elect\u2019s national security team. Instead, it relayed that information through Mr. Kushner, whose company was not only in the midst of discussions with Anbang but also has Chinese investors. Ethics experts said that while the conflict-of-interest law is narrowly drawn, Mr. Kushner\u2019s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions. Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, said deals like the one with Anbang \u201cmight not be illegal under the conflict-of-interest rules, but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner\u2019s business to try to influence U.S. policy.\u201d Without knowing details of Mr. Kushner\u2019s holdings and divestiture plans, he said, the merits of his proposal are hard to assess. Even if he divests his stake in certain properties, Mr. Sanderson added, \u201cit strikes me as a half-measure\u201d that \u201cstill poses a real conflict-of-interest issue and would be a drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and cause the American people to question Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in policy making.\u201d Photo From left, Josh, Charles and Jared Kushner, in 2014. The family has extensive holdings in real estate and private equity firms. Credit Patrick McMullan The Family Business Like the president-elect, Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful father. In the 1980s, his father, Charles Kushner, took over the New Jersey-based construction business started by his own father, a Holocaust survivor from Poland. Charles expanded into office buildings and apartments, eventually assembling a $1 billion real estate business and becoming a leading Democratic donor , contributing to politicians in New Jersey and New York and winning appointment to the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But the company was upended when Charles became engulfed in a nasty family feud over how the business\u2019s proceeds were to be distributed. The fight, which played out in a federal courthouse in Newark, resulted in a plea deal for Charles, who in 2005 was sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations. The family infighting was so bitter that, at one point, Charles hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, videotaped the encounter and sent the footage to his sister. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jared, 23 at the time of his father\u2019s conviction, had recently graduated from Harvard. He was studying for an M.B.A. and law degree at New York University in 2006 when he bought The New York Observer, at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city\u2019s elite and high-end real estate. It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business. The company now says he became chief executive in 2008, but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012. Nevertheless, Mr. Kushner quickly became the company\u2019s public face as it expanded across the Hudson River into Manhattan, much as Mr. Trump had left Queens for the big city decades before. Charles Kushner was released from federal custody in August 2006. He immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today. Still, it was with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever: $1.8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day. It was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the United States \u2014 and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier. Around this time, Mr. Kushner met the woman he would marry: Ivanka Trump. \u201cJ-Vanka,\u201d the headlines blared , as the New York tabloids celebrated a match made in real estate heaven. Everything was looking up, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Within a year after the deal, the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans \u2014 and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue. To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity firm; Vornado Realty Trust, then a co-owner of two of Mr. Trump\u2019s largest properties; and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men. In the end, Mr. Kushner\u2019s company survived, and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international boldface-name circuit. In August, they were spotted with Wendi Deng, an ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, on the 453-foot yacht Rising Sun, owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen. Several weeks later, they were photographed watching the United States Open tennis finals with the art collector Dasha Zhukova, wife of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle. Since 2012, Kushner Companies has been on a buying spree. It has acquired at least 120 properties, mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New Jersey, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, a research firm. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Recent deals include the $340 million acquisition of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and $345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land. Mr. Kushner\u2019s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times building for $295 million in 2015 from Lev Leviev, an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia. Increasingly, the company is branching out across the country \u2014 to Philadelphia; Baltimore; Toledo, Ohio; and Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of AT&T. In all, the company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.

Credit Jean Catuffe/GC Images Investors and Creditors As the Kushners have expanded their businesses, they have also, by necessity, expanded their universe of investors and creditors. Lenders have included private equity giants like Blackstone, the French bank Natixis and Goldman Sachs. Another lender is Deutsche Bank, which recently reached a $7.2 billion settlement with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities. But it remains under investigation over allegations that it disguised trades that helped Russian clients move money offshore. Beyond real estate, Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall Street, health care and tech spaces. He has an indirect investment in Thrive Capital, a venture capital firm valued at about $1.5 billion that is run by his brother, Joshua. The company has made more than 100 investments in dozens of companies, both in the United States and abroad. Among them is Oscar , a health insurance company founded in 2012 to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle. Oscar\u2019s investors have included Li Ka-shing, who is one of Hong Kong\u2019s richest men, and China\u2019s Ping An Insurance, which has close ties to relatives of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China.

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times The Kushner brothers have counted the Russian billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner and the Chinese billionaire founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, as investors in another endeavor \u2014 Cadre , a tech-savvy real estate investment company they started with a friend. Goldman Sachs has invested in both tech ventures. But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner\u2019s real-estate investments remains a mystery. While the company lists dozens of partners on its website, it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies. One of the newest Kushner projects \u2014 a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in November in Jersey City \u2014 got nearly a quarter of its financing, about $50 million, from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified. The investors are beneficiaries of a federal program that grants two-year visas and a path to permanent residency in exchange for investments of $500,000. The program, known as EB-5, has become popular with real estate developers as a cheap form of financing; in fiscal year 2015, the State Department issued 9,764 of the visas \u2014 overwhelmingly to applicants from China . Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the program, which must be renewed periodically by Congress, has lately come under fire . The Government Accountability Office has issued several reports raising concerns about what it termed the program\u2019s insufficient background checks and lax safeguards against illicit financing. One applicant, the agency found, failed to report potential financial ties to a string of Chinese brothels . Then there are the Kushners\u2019 continuing negotiations with Anbang\u2019s Mr. Wu, one of the most politically connected men in China. Photo Kushner Companies\u2019 real estate holdings include, clockwise from top left, 666 Fifth Avenue; the former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses headquarters in Brooklyn; the old New York Times building; and Trump Bay Street in Jersey City. Credit Photographs by Pablo Enriquez for The New York Times, except top right by Edward Caruso for The New York Times Anbang Draws Scrutiny In 2015, Mr. Kushner began pursuing a grand vision for 666 Fifth Avenue. The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the 40-story, 1950s-era aluminum-clad office building, adding apartments, a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1,400 feet. But the plan needed money, and while Mr. Kushner had managed to hang on to his family\u2019s flagship building, it still had a lot of debt, with a $1.1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant. Anbang, which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004, had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate, and had begun investing in hotels. But it had encountered problems of its own; its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington. The Times reported last year that Anbang is owned by a few dozen companies, which in turn are owned by a number of shell companies that are controlled by roughly 100 people, many of whom have ties to a county in China that is the home of Mr. Wu, whose own power stems in part from marriage. In his case he married Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era. Mr. Wu also counts as a central business partner the son of a People\u2019s Liberation Army marshal, and he has recruited several former government insurance regulators to serve on his board. Photo Wu Xiaohui, the chairman and chief executive of Anbang Insurance, a Chinese financial behemoth which owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel and controls as much as $285 billion in assets. Credit Ben Asen/International Insurance Society Anbang\u2019s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, have opted not to advise the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their \u201cknow your client\u201d guidelines. Anbang\u2019s deep ties to the Chinese state have also led to a break in presidential protocol. Presidents have long stayed at the Waldorf, but when Mr. Obama visited New York for the opening of a session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, he decided to seek other accommodations . American officials were vague about the reasons for the change at the time; a senior national security official cited security, counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns. Advertisement Continue reading the main story National security concerns have also complicated Anbang\u2019s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States. One deal, to buy the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or state-connected companies. The Hotel del Coronado is near a naval base, and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny. Anbang was, however, able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection. Last year, Anbang tried to purchase the Starwood Hotels chain, outbidding Marriott with a $14 billion offer . It was widely reported that the deal would be subject to review by the committee. But though the parties expressed confidence that it would pass muster, ultimately Anbang walked away from the deal before submitting the kind of detailed inside information that process would entail. And while Anbang\u2019s planned $1.57 billion purchase of Des Moines-based Fidelity & Guaranty Life, first announced in November 2015, was cleared by the committee, also known as Cfius, it stalled after the New York State Department of Financial Services demanded more information about Anbang\u2019s shareholding structure. Photo Mr. Kushner, left, met with President Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Denis McDonough, at the White House on Nov. 10. Credit Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images But Anbang was nothing if not savvy. Company officials had cultivated a relationship with Benjamin M. Lawsky, who had earlier led the financial services agency, from May 2011 to June 2015. It was Mr. Lawsky, by then a consultant, who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies, according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about. Mr. Lawsky declined to comment. Mr. Kushner led the negotiations, his spokeswoman, Ms. Heller, confirmed. Kushner Companies would disclose little else about the joint venture, except to say that Anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building\u2019s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized. Anbang declined to comment. It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner\u2019s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election, Ms. Heller said, adding that it had been in the works for a while. By the time of the meeting, Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships, including the one with Anbang, to others at Kushner Companies, according to Ms. Heller, and it was for that reason that he invited his father and Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies. She said he planned to sell his stake in 666 Fifth before the closing of any Anbang deal, but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price Mr. Kushner hoped to get. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Heller stressed in her statement that the United States has \u201cnot found Anbang to be a state-owned enterprise\u201d \u2014 an important technical point, given that the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments. Should it consummate its deal with Anbang, she said, Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government. She expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee, citing the fact that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria. Come Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, that committee will be made up of his cabinet members, and the process is such that the president has the final say. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More It is a process with which Mr. Trump has some familiarity. During the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting, as secretary of state and member of the foreign investment committee, a deal that benefited donors to her family\u2019s charitable foundation while giving the Russians control of about 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium-extraction capacity. On China, Mr. Trump has talked a tough game, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war. But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen. The president-elect has his own financial entanglements with China: He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly $950 million to a group of lenders that includes the Bank of China, and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is another state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. With Anbang a magnet for controversy, Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps. But a week after the Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf, Mr. Kushner\u2019s father and Mr. Wu met at the hotel for lunch. After the elder Mr. Kushner departed, Mr. Wu was clearly elated. \u201cI love you guys,\u201d he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage, according to one person present.

USA TODAY NETWORK A lot can happen in six hours. For a Golden Globe Awards attendee\u00a0who arrives on time, that\u2019s about how long you spend in the Beverly Hilton ballroom to celebrate those that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association deems the best in TV and film. Those six hours can have emotional extremes. Here are 10 strong feelings you might have at the\u00a0 schmoozy, boozy awards soiree if you're a first-time guest who's under the weather. (This reporter was a bit feverish, which may explain some of the heightened emotions.) What the #goldenglobes ballroom looks like when you get there exactly on the time listed on your ticket. (2:30pt, cocktail hour) pic.twitter.com/LKfq9y83BZ \u2014 Carly Mallenbaum (@ThatGirlCarly) January 9, 2017 \u00a0 First feeling: Excitement You\u2019re there at 2:30 p.m. PT, when the invitation said cocktails are served. The rest of the ballroom is empty, save for a handful of photographers snapping pictures of the stage, table placards and centerpieces. You wait for them to finish clicking away, so you can take photos of your own, and examine who is sitting where: film stars including Meryl Streep, Ryan Reynolds and Emma Stone get prime spots on the floor closest to the stage, TV actors like the Game of Thrones\u00a0squad are stationed one level up from them, members of the HFPA \u2014 many of them elderly in pearls and ascots \u2014 are a row up from there, and you\u2019re another step away from that. Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn are sitting front and center at the #goldenglobes . pic.twitter.com/LiOiUCc89Z \u2014 Carly Mallenbaum (@ThatGirlCarly) January 8, 2017 Second feeling: Loneliness By 4 p.m., you\u2019re still the only person at your table that seats at least 10. \u00a0 (Later, you'll learn that other journalists are also seated at table 316, but they know not to arrive so early.) The dozens of other tables have only a couple of guests each. Every salad but yours is thrown out. It feels wasteful. You eat your entr\u00e9e of fish and steak alone. You joke with the waiter. You miss him when he leaves. Third feeling: Admiration Half an hour later, \"talent\" begins arriving. You find some of your favorite stars in the bars\u00a0outside of the ballroom. Sylvester Stallone has a friendlier and younger-looking face than you imagined. He orders bourbon as you comment to his brother Frank about\u00a0how interesting those mini champagne glasses with the attached sippers are. Frank\u00a0pretends to play one like a trombone. You're distracted by\u00a0the stunning\u00a0back of a yellow gown next to you. You realize it belongs to Emily Ratajkowski,\u00a0who\u00a0actively avoids eye contact with you when you consider\u00a0complimenting her on it. Emily Ratajkowski's adorned yellow dress was a standout. \u00a0(Photo: Matt Sayles, Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) You chat with the bartender who just served Anna Kendrick, and look over to the actress who appears very petite with a puddle of silver dress at her feet. You think about telling her that her hairstyle inspired your own, but her body language indicates she doesn't want to talk to anyone outside of her inner circle. Michelle Williams and Natalie Portman stand out in the crowd. Even if you didn't know who they were, you'd know they were special \u2014 their faces kind; their skin perfect; their body language approachable. The two nominees have a genial chat in the doorway. You see a person you later realize is Casey Affleck, but for a moment think he's an old, man-bunned friend of yours you can't place. You get lost in Chris Pine's ocean-blue eyes for a moment. You recognize that a hoarse voice asking for directions to the bathroom\u00a0belongs to\u00a0Cuba Gooding Jr., and you\u00a0turn to direct him. He gives you an appreciative smile, perhaps grateful that you didn't make any \"show me the restroom\" jokes. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The Hilton\u00a0manages to cram more humans into it than a fire marshal might consider safe. In fact, many security officials are on guard continually telling you to move out of the way, as you just try to get to your seat. Stars aren't immune to the tight traffic: you accidentally brush into Carl Weathers and Hugh Grant as you try to traverse the room. Excuse me, sorry. Stars win awards, they thank lots of people. Guests\u00a0around you cheer and clap. You can tell where the winning studios and casts\u00a0are sitting, based on where the loudest applause is coming from. You feel a vicarious thrill\u00a0for\u00a0the winners. Fifth feeling: Jealousy Mr. Robot actor Rami Malek tells Modern Family\u2019s Sofia Vergara, \u201cCongratulations on all of your wins over nine years.\u201d Crazy Ex-Girlfriend writer Aline Brosh McKenna compliments Insecure star Issa Rae: \u201cI love your show.\u201d Colin Farrell and Bryan Cranston embrace. Justin Timberlake and Pharrell talk to each other in high-pitched voices. It\u2019s some sort of inside joke. JT, Jessica Biel and Pharrell are joking in falsetto voices before heading back into the ballroom #goldenglobes pic.twitter.com/DyPTJSwmkc \u2014 Carly Mallenbaum (@ThatGirlCarly) January 9, 2017 Isn\u2019t it nice how all these Hollywood types are loving on each other and supporting each other? It looks like something you\u2019d like to be a part of, but you're not nominated \u2014 you're press;\u00a0you're just observing. Though stars are accepting selfie requests, you refuse to be one of the guests who badgers them for photos, for reasons including the fact that it's unprofessional. You hear Naomie Harris complain that her dress gives her little room to breathe. You shoot her a sincere, sympathetic look even though you're not in her conversation.\u00a0\u00a0You think about how fun this party would be if you were celebrating your own accomplishment with your own friends. Sixth feeling: Greed By 7 p.m., you realize you should take advantage of all of the food and drink stations\u00a0at this event. You sample a \"dark chocolate with hazelnut ganache\" bite (that's what the woman in the chef hat calls it)\u00a0from the chocolate bar. It melts in your mouth. You\u00a0promise to\u00a0taste the almond treat next.\u00a0You try an espresso from the\u00a0coffee\u00a0bar and may have accidentally cut the line to get it. You get a vodka soda\u00a0 from the bar-bar. You know you'll probably ditch that drink soon and order another one, because ordering drinks is fun. \u2014 Carly Mallenbaum (@ThatGirlCarly) January 9, 2017 You nibble the finger food. You don't smoke, but you kinda wish you did so you could schmooze with Heidi Klum, who's very focused on capturing a good selfie,\u00a0on the smoking deck overlooking the pool. You go to the makeup stand in the bathroom and let a hairstylist re-curl your hair and powder your face. You pick up a free \"wild rose\"-flavored lip gloss  from the sink. You realize you probably need the darker \"sultry sangria\" shade, too. Seventh feeling: Respect After indulging, you\u2019re full and ready to listen to the show. Remember, that's the reason you're there. Though the crowd at the bar nearby is loud, as Matt Damon comments when he takes the podium, you stop hearing those people\u00a0when Viola Davis presents the Cecil B. DeMille Award to Meryl Streep. Then, Streep makes an impassioned speech about diversity, politics and art. You are\u00a0with her, and so is the room that gives her the biggest standing ovation of the night with several applause moments throughout the speech. People around you are nodding emphatically. \"Wow,\" they say. Eighth feeling: Happiness La La Land was your favorite film of 2016, so it delights you that it keeps winning trophies. You feel good that, as the speeches keep reminding you, a studio \u201ctook a chance\u201d on an original musical. There is good in the world! You see others win, including Tracee Ellis Ross, Casey Affleck and Donald Glover. They\u2019re so grateful. You want them all to keep winning at life! Major standing o for Donald Glover and #Atlanta at #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/BEaqmHrN5l \u2014 Carly Mallenbaum (@ThatGirlCarly) January 9, 2017 Ninth feeling: Exhaustion There\u2019s an announcement during commercial break: \u201cWe are running way over. Work\u00a0with us and we\u2019ll work with you.\u201d Not what you want to hear at 8 p.m. Suddenly, you realize how tired you are, even though all you\u2019ve done is walk, eat and sit. You want to be in bed. Oh yeah, you\u2019re sick. You take more Tylenol. You hear others complain about how long the show is. You remember that Questlove has been standing up on stage to deejay for the entire three-hour-plus telecast. Questlove is the man. Questlove spent most of the Golden Globe Awards at a turntable onstage. \u00a0(Photo: Paul Drinkwater, AP) Tenth feeling: Gratitude You see Sunny Pawar, the 8-year-old\u00a0star of Lion, shivering in an oversized tuxedo jacket that clearly doesn't belong to him. You\u2019re told that he\u2019s not feeling well. You snap out of your fatigue, and just want to hug the kid. You don\u2019t, because that would be inappropriate. Instead, you congratulate every winner you walk by, including Tom Hiddleston, Billy Bob Thornton and Andrew Taylor-Johnson. You mean it. They smile graciously while\u00a0gripping their Globes. ",

The L.A. City Council settled lawsuits brought by his relatives over the killing. Brendon Glenn lived near the Venice boardwalk and often spent days skateboarding at the skate park before he was shot and killed during an altercation with Los Angeles police. The L.A. City Council settled lawsuits brought by his relatives over the killing. (Mike Costanza) Dakota Smith Contact Reporter The Los Angeles City Council in recent years has repeatedly settled costly, high-profile lawsuits, agreeing to spend millions of dollars to end litigation brought by grieving families, disability-rights groups and people wrongfully convicted of crimes. City Hall leaders championed some of the settlements as having a silver lining for taxpayers, such as one in 2015 that created a program to fix L.A.\u2019s buckling sidewalks. But a surge in legal settlements, along with court judgments against the city, is outpacing the city\u2019s ability to keep up. With payouts projected to total at least $135 million this fiscal year, budget officials said Monday that the city needs to immediately borrow up to $70 million to avoid dipping into its emergency reserve fund. In a new report, the City Administrative Office said the gap reflected \u201ca new trend of increased liability payouts.\u201d The report\u00a0recommended raising the money through a bond that would be paid back over 10 years. Such borrowing would cost the city millions of dollars each year in interest and fees. Under one scenario discussed Monday, the city would pay $9 million each year in principal and interest on a\u00a0$70-million bond. Councilman Mitchell Englander voted against the bond at Monday\u2019s\u00a0budget committee meeting, arguing the city needs to do a better job allocating its money given the repeated lawsuits. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in the same boat next fiscal year...it\u2019s every year,\u201d Englander said. The measure was approved, 4-1, and sent to the full council. The city typically budgets $60 million a year for its legal liability fund, but has seen a significant number of settlements since the fiscal year began on July 1. City Administrative\u00a0Officer Miguel Santana said his office issued financial reports to the City Council for the last several years warning of costs to the city because of the lawsuits. He also called on the mayor and City Council to \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the amount funded for liabilities. \u201cIdeally we would have budgeted more,\u201d Santana said. In August, the City Council agreed to a roughly\u00a0 $200-million settlement over a housing-related lawsuit brought by disability-rights\u00a0groups, with the city expected to pay about $20 million a year. Last month, the council agreed to an\u00a0 $8-million settlement \u00a0to end lawsuits related to the fatal Los Angeles Police Department shootings of three unarmed men in separate incidents.\u00a0The payouts are among the highest by the city for\u00a0deadly police shootings in the last decade. Two years ago, officials agreed to spend $1.2 billion over the next three\u00a0decades as part of a legal settlement to fix the city\u2019s massive\u00a0backlog of broken sidewalks. The\u00a0city\u00a0paid out $110 million in legal cases last fiscal year, according to budget staff. In January 2016, the city agreed to pay out\u00a0$24 million to settle lawsuits from two men who alleged that dishonest LAPD detectives led their wrongful murder convictions and caused them to spend decades behind bars. City lawyers concerned about the police misconduct allegations recommended the settlements, saying in confidential memos to the City Council that taking the cases to trial could be even costlier. In an interview Monday, Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer cited several reasons for the increased payouts. He said\u00a0juries\u00a0are more skeptical about law enforcement when it comes to police liability, and cited\u00a0a \u201csignificant\u201d amount of deferred maintenance of city infrastructure. Jay Handal, co-chairman of the Los Angeles Neighborhood Council Budget Advocates, questioned the city\u2019s approach given the bond\u2019s interest rates.\u00a0Such\u00a0costly borrowing, he said, makes more sense for long-range construction projects, not ongoing legal expenses.\u00a0 \u201cWhat this [proposal] tells you is that we have an upper management who quite honestly isn\u2019t addressing the systemic problems we have in our budget,\u201d Handal said. Already, the city has taken $28.5 million from its\u00a0reserve fund this fiscal year to cover legal payouts, according to\u00a0Assistant\u00a0City Administrative Officer Ben Ceja.\u00a0 As of November, the reserve fund\u00a0stood at about\u00a0$295 million, which the CAO report said is \u201conly precariously above\u201d the minimum amount required under city policy \u2014 5% of the General Fund budget. Reducing the city\u2019s reserve fund has the potential to hurt its bond rating, which makes it more expensive to borrow money. Ceja said the rising expenditures\u00a0\u201ccould be the new normal in terms of paying out cases.\u201d The last time L.A. issued a such a bond was after the 2010 May Day Melee, when the city was forced to pay millions in lawsuit settlements after police turned on demonstrators at MacArthur Park. The city borrowed $50 million and currently spends $6.5 million to pay off that debt, according to budget documents. Councilman Paul Krekorian , who\u00a0chairs the city\u2019s Budget and Finance Committee and voted for the bond, said he\u2019s hopeful that a working group established with Feuer\u2019s office in 2015 will help bring down costs as city lawyers work to reduce legal risks. \u201cIt\u2019s not my preferred solution,\u201d Krekorian said of the bond. \u201cMy preferred solution is to have a budget that anticipates what our likely liability will be.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \"La La Land\" was the big winner at the Golden Globes , what values does Hollywood promote? , storms have slammed Northern California , Thomas Barrack\u2019s latest gig is planning the president-elect's inauguration .
