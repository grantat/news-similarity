    "text": "Senators wary of only repealing ObamaCare adds to GOP's dismantle travails Published               January 07, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Congressional Republicans\u2019 years-long mission to dismantle ObamaCare is becoming more of an uphill battle, amid a growing concern among some GOP senators about voting to repeal the health care law without a replacement. The most recent is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who late Friday tweeted that incoming President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, agrees with his approach to simultaneously repeal and replace the 2010 law. \"I just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it,\" Paul tweeted. \"The time to act is now.\" Earlier in the day, GOP Sens. Bob Corker, Tennessee, and Ron Johnson, Wisconsin, expressed similar thoughts. Corker said Republicans might find themselves in a \"box canyon\" if they just incrementally replace parts of the law. He worries about congressional Republicans having to take an unpopular vote to increase taxes if, for example, they repeal the part of ObgamaCare that increased taxes on higher wage-earners but temporarily continue subsidies in the law that help lower-income Americans buy coverage. Johnson said: \u201cI would start bringing up those elements that start repairing the damage and I would start taking votes on those right now.\u201d President Obama\u2019 signature law was created to provide universal health coverage to Americans, in an effort to reduce overall health care costs by curtailing emergency room visits for routine care and other uninsured medical expenses. However, under-enrollment, particularly among young and healthy participants, along with doctors and insurance companies dropping out, has resulted in rising premium costs. Trump and other Washington Republicans have campaigned almost endlessly on the promise to dismantle ObamaCare. But ending it without an alternative for the roughly 20 million now enrolled could result in a political train wreck. \u00a0 Senate Republicans on Tuesday, the first day of the 115th Congress, took the first legislative steps to repeal the law. However, they made clear in the time between Trump\u2019s November win and their return that a full replacement might take years, considering they had no alternative plan. The situation puts them under tremendous pressure to fulfill \"Day One\" promises to voters to end ObamaCare.\u00a0 The Trump transition team did not respond Saturday to a request from FoxNews.com to verify Paul\u2019s claim about Trump\u2019s support. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also called this week for a simultaneous effort to erase the health care law and rewrite it. \"I don't think we can just repeal Obamacare and say we're going to get an answer two years from now,\" he said Thursday on MSNBC. \"We haven't coalesced around a solution for six years, in part because it is so complicated,\u201d he also said. \u201cKicking the can down the road for a year or two years isn't going to make it any easier to solve.\" With Trump as president and fellow Republicans controlling Congress, the GOP indeed finally has an opportunity to repeal the law. But nothing about revamping the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system will come easy, with congressional Democrats vowing the stop Republicans at essentially every step. \u00a0 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said if Republicans void Obama's bill, Democrats won't help them pass alternative legislation. Republicans probably will need just a simple Senate majority to approve their repeal bill, but for procedural reasons, later replacement legislation likely will need 60 votes. Republicans now hold a 52-48 edge in the Senate. That means a need for at least eight Democratic votes, though there will be pressure on 10 Democrats facing re-election next year from states Trump won in November. \"I take Minority Leader Schumer at his word that if we do this we're not going to get any Democratic support. In order to actually pass a replacement, we need Democratic support,\" Johnson said. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

Four died from weather-related causes in Oregon, Kentucky, Georgia and Maine, according to The Weather Channel. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia were forecast to see up to a foot of snow while roads in Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama were coated in ice, leading to hundreds of accidents. Charlotte, North Carolina, reported Saturday morning that 46 accidents, some with minor injuries, had occurred since 10 p.m. Friday. In Connecticut, state troopers reported a pileup that included at least 20 cars, three tractor trailers and a tanker on Saturday, but there were no serious injuries. Snow began falling in New York City Saturday morning and continued into the evening. Major delays were reported at New York City area airports on Saturday, with some arriving flights delayed an average of more than 6 hours. Winter Storm #Helena is moving northeast and will bring snow and wind from parts of the Mid-Atlantic to New England: https://t.co/1rh2yB8ByS pic.twitter.com/LdNMrG7UXD \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) January 7, 2017 Blizzard warnings were in place for parts of Massachusetts through Sunday morning. In Boston Saturday, Mayor Martin Walsh announced the preparations the city had undertaken due to the winter weather. More than 30,000 tons of salt were available for use and 420 pieces of snow equipment would be out on the roadway by 1 p.m. Additional resources would also be made available if necessary. \"With expected accumulations reaching nearly a foot of snow over the course of the day, we are encouraging residents to use caution if they need to travel and keep an eye out for our neighbors, especially our seniors during this time,\" Walsh said in a statement. States of emergency were declared in Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas, where road workers manned 12-hour shifts to treat roads as the storm covered the region in a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. Sleet and snow fell on the northwest suburbs of Atlanta while rain and freezing rain brought slush to the city's streets. On Saturday morning, Delta canceled 175 flights, most of which were into and out of its hub in Atlanta, due to the accumulation of ice at the airport there. Police in Alabama said roads in parts of the state were impassable, including around Anniston and Oxford. State troopers said they had responded to several weather-related crashes and warned that ice-covered bridges were hazardous around Birmingham. Play ",

I had to quit my job to take care of her and my 12-year old son. I am 59 years old and don't expect to be able to return to work. She receives $2,000 a month and my son receives $1,000 a month from Social Security Disability Insurance. What are my options when I am 62? Can file for my Social Security? Can I claim spousal benefits and let mine grow to full retirement age (FRA)? My benefit amount at 62 will be around $1,200. There is little to no information on my situation out there. Also, is there any other avenues that you know of to help us? \u2013\u00a0Peter\u00a0Jorland, Minnesota A: Unfortunately, you will not qualify for a spousal benefit because your benefit is higher, says Elaine Floyd, the director of retirement and life planning at Horsesmouth. \u201cThe strategy of taking a spousal benefit and letting your own benefit grow is being phased out under the Budget Act passed last year, and you are not grandfathered,\u201d says Floyd. When you turn 62, Floyd says you may file for your own reduced benefit, but that will be your permanent benefit unless your wife passes away, in which case you would be able to transfer to a survivor benefit of about $2,000 per month - assuming you file for it at your full retirement age or later. \u201cI'm sorry to say this, but your strategy will depend on your wife's life expectancy,\u201d says Floyd. \u201cIf she has beaten the cancer and expects to live a long time, I would encourage you to delay your benefit to full retirement age or later in order to maximize your lifetime benefits.\u201d But if your wife has a short life expectancy, you could go ahead and claim your own reduced benefit at 62 because he would be jumping up to the higher survivor benefit, says Floyd.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Late Saturday afternoon, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida announced that Mr. Santiago had been arrested and charged on a federal criminal complaint \u201cin connection with the deadly shooting of multiple victims at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\u201d His first court appearance was scheduled for Monday morning before a federal magistrate in Fort Lauderdale. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Law enforcement officials said they had not determined a motive or cause for the attack. And while they said they could not exclude the possibility of terrorism, the initial investigation suggested that Mr. Santiago had acted alone and that there was no evidence that he had terrorist ties. \u201cIt\u2019s way too early for us to really rule out anything,\u201d George Piro, the agent in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s Miami office, said at a news conference here on Saturday. But family members said they had a pretty good idea of what led to the attack. \u201cHe said he heard certain voices, that the U.S. government wanted to enroll him in certain groups for ISIS, and he was very paranoid,\u201d Bryan Santiago Ruiz, an older brother, said in an interview on Saturday in Pe\u00f1uelas, the small town in Puerto Rico where they grew up. Esteban Santiago lived in Anchorage, and Bryan Santiago said he had visited him there, most recently staying with him from August through October. \u201cHe said that the C.I.A. controlled him through secret messages over the internet and told him the things he had to do,\u201d he recalled. It was on Nov. 7 that Esteban Santiago went to the F.B.I. office in Anchorage \u201cto report that his mind was being controlled by U.S. intelligence agencies,\u201d Marlin L. Ritzman, the agent in charge of the office, said on Saturday. \u201cDuring the interview, Mr. Santiago appeared agitated, incoherent and made disjointed statements.\u201d Elaborating, a senior law enforcement official said Mr. Santiago had claimed that the C.I.A. put terrorist propaganda on his computer. F.B.I. agents called the local police, who took him to a psychiatric facility. \u201cSantiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS,\u201d said Christopher Tolley, the Anchorage police chief, referring to the Islamic State. Advertisement Continue reading the main story When Mr. Santiago went into the F.B.I. office, he left a pistol and his newborn son in his vehicle, Chief Tolley said, and he had an ammunition clip in his pocket. The senior law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly, said the gun was the same weapon used in the airport shooting on Friday. Video 'He Was Very Paranoid' The brother of the gunman who killed five people at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Friday talks about the attacker's delusions and his struggle to receive psychiatric treatment. By CARLA MINET and AINARA TIEFENTH\u00c4LER on Publish Date January 7, 2017. Photo by Broward Sheriff's Office. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed The police confiscated the gun but returned it to him in December, the chief said. Bryan Santiago said his brother was held at the hospital for just a few days before being released and, as far as he knew, did not have any follow-up treatment, like medication or therapy. The Fort Lauderdale airport reopened on Saturday, as the F.B.I. led an investigation that sprawled across the country and airport officials tried to reunite people with what they said were 20,000 items that had been recovered from the terminal, left behind by passengers and airport workers fleeing for their lives. Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey but was raised in Puerto Rico, where he joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in 2007 before he finished high school. A classmate said he had always wanted to be a soldier. In 2010, Mr. Santiago was deployed to Iraq for nine months, working with the 130th Engineer Battalion clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges, according to the Alaska Army National Guard. His company was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. Guard officials said at least two members of the company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour, but there is no record indicating that Mr. Santiago was ever involved in combat. But family members said Mr. Santiago was never quite the same after his return. \u201cAfter Iraq, something happened,\u201d Hernan Rivera, 70, Mr. Santiago\u2019s uncle, said Saturday afternoon as he stood in his driveway in Union City, N.J. \u201cWhen he came back from Iraq, he was a different person.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story He described his nephew as a \u201cnormal kid\u201d who enjoyed reading. \u201cHe was a person who used to talk a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then when he came back, he kept to himself, he\u2019d go to his room, he wouldn\u2019t talk to anybody.\u201d In 2014, he moved to Alaska and joined the Alaska Army National Guard. He got a job as a security guard and found a girlfriend 14 years his senior. A few months ago, they had a baby; a law enforcement official said it was not clear whether that was the same child that he brought with him to the F.B.I. office in November. In January 2016, the girlfriend told the police that Mr. Santiago had flown into a rage while she was using the bathroom, broke down the bathroom door, and was \u201cstrangling her and smacking her in the side of the head\u201d while screaming at her, according to a criminal complaint filed against him. A month later, he was charged with violating a court order to stay away from his girlfriend after the police found that he had been living with her again. In March, a deferred judgment was entered in the case, meaning that it could be dismissed if he stayed out of trouble, but the signs of unrest continued. Chief Tolley said that once in March and twice in October, Mr. Santiago was the subject of domestic disturbance calls, but each time, officers lacked the basis for making an arrest. In August, Mr. Santiago, who had reached the rank of private first class and had won several commendations for his earlier National Guard service \u2014 including the Army Good Conduct Medal \u2014 was discharged by the Alaska Guard for \u201cunsatisfactory performance.\u201d Despite the disturbing nature of the episode with the F.B.I. in November, it did not land Mr. Santiago on any law enforcement watch lists or on the federal government\u2019s \u201cno-fly\u201d list. Neither did it impede his right to possess a gun. At a news conference in Anchorage on Saturday, officials with the F.B.I. and local law enforcement said that although Mr. Santiago was clearly incoherent during his encounter with F.B.I. agents, he was not deemed to be threatening.

Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June, had fallen under F.B.I. scrutiny twice for possible ties to terrorism. Slide Show ",

Penn State\u2019s costs related to the Sandusky scandal are approaching a quarter-billion dollars and growing. It\u2019s been five years since the former assistant football coach was arrested on child molestation charges. The school\u2019s overall cost of the scandal is now at least $237 million. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) 0 Shares Email Penn State's costs related to the Jerry Sandusky scandal are approaching a quarter-billion dollars and growing, five years after the former assistant football coach's arrest on child molestation charges. The scandal's overall cost to the school has reached at least $237 million, including a recent $12 million verdict in the whistleblower and defamation case brought by former assistant coach Mike McQueary, whose testimony helped convict Sandusky in 2012. The university has settled with 33 people over allegations they were sexually abused by Sandusky, and has made total payments to them of $93 million. The total also covers the $48 million \"fine\" levied by the NCAA that is funding anti-child-abuse efforts in Pennsylvania, $27 million in lawyer fees to defend lawsuits, nearly $14 million that includes the legal defense of three former administrators facing criminal charges for their handling of Sandusky complaints and $5.3 million for crisis communications and other consultants. The school's latest financial statement said insurers have covered $30 million in costs, while other insurance claims remain pending. Penn State says donations, student tuition, and taxpayer funds aren't being used to pay uninsured costs, including legal expenses. Instead, the school is relying on interest revenue from university loans. The school also was hit in November with a $2.4 million fine from a federal investigation, started immediately after Sandusky was arrested, that concluded the university repeatedly violated campus crime reporting requirements. A look at where some of the other pending Sandusky-related matters stand: \u2014\u2014\u2014 ADMINISTRATORS' CRIMINAL CASE A senior judge sitting in Harrisburg is considering a request by three former high-ranking Penn State administrators to throw out their criminal charges, following an oral argument that was held in Harrisburg in October. Former Penn State President Graham Spanier, former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Vice President Gary Schultz are accused of not responding properly to McQueary's 2001 complaint that Sandusky was sexually abusing a boy in a team shower. They are also accused of putting children in danger. The attorney general's office wants to add a new count, of conspiracy to commit endangering the welfare of children, against all three defendants. Judge John Boccabella has not indicated when he might rule. The three men have consistently maintained their innocence. \u2014\u2014\u2014 SANDUSKY'S APPEAL Sandusky is serving a 30- to 60-year sentence in Greene State Prison on a 45-count conviction for sexual abuse of 10 boys, and he is currently pursuing an appeal in county court near State College. In November, the judge handling that appeal \u2014 Judge John Cleland, who was also the trial judge \u2014 took himself off the case after Sandusky's lawyers raised objections to Cleland's role in a December 2011 meeting in a hotel the night before Sandusky waived a preliminary hearing. Cleland's sternly worded order included a footnote saying his review of the 34 issues raised by Sandusky found none of them had merit. The state court system is working on appointing a new judge, but that decision has not been made. \u2014\u2014\u2014 SPANIER V. PENN STATE Penn State countersued Spanier last month, saying he violated his employment agreement by not disclosing what he knew about Sandusky before Sandusky's 2011 arrest. The school is seeking repayment of millions of dollars it has paid him over the past five years. Spanier's lawsuit claims the school violated an agreement made when he was pushed out of the top job \u2014 days after Sandusky was charged \u2014 by making public comments that were critical of him and not living up to promises regarding office space, teaching opportunities and payment of legal costs. \u2014\u2014\u2014 SPANIER V. FREEH A judge has scheduled a hearing later this month in a lawsuit by Spanier against former FBI Director Louis Freeh and his law firm, who were paid by Penn State to produce a 2012 report into how Spanier and other top administrators handled the Sandusky matter. Judge Robert Eby will hear oral argument in Freeh's preliminary objections to the lawsuit. Spanier is seeking damages for the reputational and economic harm he alleges resulted from the report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 PATERNO V. NCAA The family of former Penn State head coach Joe Paterno is suing the NCAA, saying it damaged the Paterno estate's commercial interests by relying on conclusions about Paterno in the Freeh report. Two former Paterno assistants, son Jay Paterno and Bill Kenney, are also suing, saying they have not been able to find comparable work because of the Freeh report. The most recent action in that case involved a dispute over subpoenas. Paterno died in 2012. 0 Shares ",

U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara Email Last Updated Jan 7, 2017 5:04 PM EST MEXICO CITY --\u00a0Mexican prosecutors said Saturday they are searching for a gunman who opened fire on an official of the U.S. Consulate in the western city of Guadalajara. The Attorney General\u2019s Office said Saturday the official was wounded in the attack Friday in Guadalajara -- and the U.S. Consulate said on its Facebook and Twitter pages that the FBI was offering a $20,000 reward for information on the attacker. \u00a0 Guadalajara is the capital of Jalisco state, which is dominated by the hyper-violent Jalisco New Generation cartel. There was no immediate evidence of any cartel link to the attack. \u00a0 Surveillance video of the attack shows the gunman following the official in a parking garage. The official, whose name was not released, was dressed in shorts. The shooting appeared to be a direct attempt to kill the consular employee. In the video, the attacker doesn\u2019t appear to try to approach the official while he is walking, but instead waits for him to exit the parking garage in his vehicle and fires a round into the car\u2019s windshield. The U.S. Consulate posted several clips of CCTV video related to the incident on its Facebook page.\u00a0 Continuaci\u00f3n El FBI ofrece una recompensa de $ 20,000 d\u00f3lares por informaci\u00f3n que lleve a la identificaci\u00f3n del sujeto que dispar\u00f3 a un oficial del Consulado de los Estados Unidos hoy en Guadalajara. Por favor llame a la Embajada de los Estados Unidos en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico si lo reconoce al (01-55) 5080-2000. El video del tirador est\u00e1 disponible en esta p\u00e1gina de Facebook Posted by Consulado General de los Estados Unidos en Guadalajara on Friday, January 6, 2017 Guadalajara is Mexico\u2019s second largest city and is not specifically singled out for any special precautions in the latest U.S. travel warning updated on Dec. 8. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said that for privacy reasons no further information would be made available on the victim, including his condition. \u201cThe safety and security of our employees overseas is among our highest priorities,\u201d said an embassy spokeswoman who was not authorized to be quoted by name. \u201cWe are working closely with Mexican law enforcement in this matter.\u201d The Attorney General\u2019s Office said the victim was in \u201cstable\u201d condition and under protection, apparently at a local hospital. The office said the case was being handled by federal detectives. An attack on diplomatic personnel would be considered a federal crime in Mexico. U.S. consular employees and other U.S. agents have been attacked in Mexico in the past; the attackers have usually argued the attacks were cases of mistaken identity. In 2014, a Mexican gang leader was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the 2010 slayings in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, of a U.S. Consulate employee, her husband and the husband of another employee. Prosecutors said Arturo Gallegos Castrellon was in charge of a team of assassins with the Barrio Azteca, a gang allied with the Juarez drug cartel, and had ordered the three slayings. The killings of U.S. Consulate employee Leslie Ann Enriquez Catton , her husband, Arthur Redfels, and Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another consulate employee, as they left a children\u2019s birthday party were a mistake, former gang members testified during the trial. Redfels was driving a white SUV that was very similar to a vehicle that Gallegos Castrellon had marked as a target for his team of assassins because they thought it belonged to members of the rival Sinaloa cartel. In 2012, uniformed police pumped 152 bullets into a U.S. Embassy vehicle carrying two CIA officers and a Mexican navy captain. The police officers, who wounded the Americans and face attempted murder charges, initially said the people they attacked were in uniform and marked cars, and that they had responded to fire from the SUV. But details of the attorney general\u2019s investigation said those attacked were in street clothes, riding in unmarked vehicles (including two of their personal cars) and under order at all times from their commanding officers. A Mexican drug cartel lieutenant pleaded guilty in 2013 to murder and attempted murder of an officer or employee of the United States in the Feb. 15, 2011, shootings of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The attackers acknowledged they were members of a Los Zetas Cartel hit squad and directly participated in the attack, which resulted in the death of ICE agent Jaime Zapata and the wounding of his colleague Victor Avila, both based in Texas. According to court documents, a commander in Los Zetas Cartel tried to hijack the agents\u2019 armored government vehicle as it was driving on Highway 57 in San Luis Potosi. After hit squads forced the vehicle off the road and surrounded it, the Zetas commander ordered the U.S. agents to get out. The agents refused and tried to identify themselves in Spanish as diplomats from the American Embassy, but the hit squad members fired into the vehicle, striking both of them. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Esteban Santiago, 26, was charged with performing an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation and two other counts, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida said. Five people were killed in the shooting rampage at the baggage claim of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport at around 12:55 p.m. Court documents say Santiago told the FBI after the shooting that he planned the attack, buying a one-way ticket from Anchorage and checked a box with a Walther 9 mm handgun and the two ammunition magazines he used in the shooting. This booking photo provided by the Broward Sheriff's Office shows suspect Esteban Ruiz Santiago, 26, Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Santiago is accused of opening fire at a Fort Lauderdale airport, killing five people. Broward Sheriff's Office / AP Santiago told the FBI that after landing he retrieved the checked handgun case, went to a bathroom and loaded the weapon, and then tucked it into his waistband and left the restroom, where he shot the first people he encountered, according to a criminal complaint. Santiago had been treated for mental health issues in Anchorage, where he lived, officials said. His aunt told NBC News that the former National Guardsman was \"not OK\" after returning from a 10-month deployment in Iraq. Related: Shooting Victim Remembered as 'Beautiful Angel,' Others ID'd In November Santiago walked into the FBI office there and complained his mind was being controlled by a U.S. intelligence agency, the FBI said Saturday. He was taken for a mental health evaluation and his gun was taken from him for safe keeping. The gun was returned in December. Play ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Emma Brown January 7 at 4:11 PM Follow @emmersbrown Democrats are pushing to delay next week\u2019s confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, until a federal watchdog agency finishes reviewing her background and financial investments for possible conflicts of interest or other ethics concerns. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) is scheduled to hold a confirmation hearing Jan. 11 for DeVos, a Michigan billionaire. She is one of several Trump nominees whose vast wealth and considerable financial holdings have overwhelmed the bipartisan Office of Government Ethics, which is responsible for vetting Cabinet nominees. [ Ethics office warns that Trump, GOP rushing Cabinet confirmations ] In a letter to Senate Democrats on Saturday, the head of the ethics office said that Trump and Republican leaders are breaking with decades of precedent by pressing for Cabinet confirmation hearings to take place before ethics reviews are completed. Walter M. Shaub Jr., the director of the ethics office, wrote that it would be \u201ccause for alarm\u201d if the Senate were to go forward with hearings on nominees who have not been fully vetted because of the potential for \u201cunknown or unresolved ethics issues. Republican HELP committee leaders have no plans to postpone DeVos\u2019s hearing in light of the concerns about the unfinished ethics review, according to a GOP committee aide. Holding hearings without completed ethics paperwork is not unprecedented, the aide said, pointing to documents showing that Rod Paige, who served as education secretary under George W. Bush, submitted his ethics paperwork eight days after his confirmation hearing in 2001. But Republicans pressed Democrats to ensure that President Obama\u2019s appointees were fully vetted before their confirmation hearings. In February 2009, in the first few weeks of Obama\u2019s administration, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u2014 whose party was then in the minority \u2014 outlined that expectation in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). DeVos is a major Republican donor who has focused the bulk of her energy and political contributions on pushing to expand charter schools and taxpayer-funded vouchers for private and religious schools. She has not worked in public education nor served in public office, and is one of eight Trump nominees that Democrats have flagged for extra scrutiny. In her responses to a HELP committee questionnaire last week, DeVos did not directly address questions devoted to identifying potential conflicts of interest. She wrote that she would consult with the Office of Government Ethics to identify and resolve any problems. [ Read Betsy DeVos\u2019s financial disclosure form ] Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the HELP committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, said that she wants to delay next week\u2019s confirmation hearing until after the ethics office has a chance to finish its job. Eli Zupnick, Murray\u2019s spokesman, said that every Obama appointee that came before the HELP committee over the past eight years had completed their ethics review before the confirmation hearing. \u201cIt would certainly be concerning if nominees break from standard practice and don\u2019t submit their ethics paperwork in advance of a hearing,\u201d Zupnick said. \u201cMaking sure that nominees don\u2019t have conflicts of interest and will truly put families across the country first is one of the most important jobs that the Senate has in this process, and we remain hopeful that it will not be rushed through.\u201d Six other HELP committee Democrats last week asked DeVos to furnish details about her contributions to and involvement with advocacy and lobbying groups, writing in a letter that they needed more information about her role in this \u201ccomplicated web of political and not-for-profit organizations\u201d to evaluate her potential conflicts of interest. local ",

USA TODAY NETWORK The Oceana Volunteer Fire Department posted this photo of Terry Andres on its Facebook page. (Photo: Facebook photo) The victims of the deadly shooting rampage at\u00a0Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport came from all walks of life. No official list of the victims has been released, but loved ones have started to talk about them to media outlets. Here's what we know: Terry Andres Virginia resident Terry Andres was identified Saturday by a volunteer fire department as a victim in the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting. Andres worked as a volunteer support technician with the Oceana Volunteer Fire Department from April 2004 through 2010, said Art Kohn, spokesman for the Virginia Beach Fire Department. The\u00a0Oceana Volunteer Fire Department is the volunteer division of the VBFD. Volunteer support technicians ride\u00a0on fire engines and brush-fire trucks to emergency scenes, where they provide firefighters food, water and\u00a0shelter; refill their oxygen-supply bottles; and perform other tasks, Kohn said. \"His participation was above-average of other people that volunteer. He was well liked and did a good job in the time that he was with us,\" Kohn said. Andres worked out of Station 8 in Virginia Beach. David Burket, a fellow volunteer support technician, said Andres was \"a very kind man.\" \"He was on the truck with us. He was a good guy, good family man. He performed off his duties very well,\" Burket said. \"We always had a good time wherever we went. He would always make you laugh.\" Burket said he was stunned by the news of Andres' death at the Florida airport. \"Could not believe it. Could not believe it.

Don Emmert /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Don Emmert /AFP/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump talks with reporters between meetings last month at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. Don Emmert /AFP/Getty Images Updated at 5:30 p.m. The Office of Government Ethics is raising alarm over the pace of confirmation hearings for President-elect Donald Trump's nominees, saying Saturday that they have yet to receive required financial disclosures for some picks set to come before Congress next week. In a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., released Saturday, OGE Director Walter Shaub wrote that \"the announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me\" and that the current schedule \"has created undue pressure on OGE's staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews. \"More significantly, it has left some of the nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues shortly before their scheduled hearings,\" Shaub continued. \"I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.\" Shaub explains in the letter that the Ethics in Government Act requires that presidential appointments confirmed by the Senate obtain OGE certification of their financial disclosures prior to any congressional hearings. Such a process is \"complex\" and \"labor-intensive,\" he notes, and takes \"weeks, not days\" to ensure that the Senate has a clear picture of any possible conflicts of interest. Article continues after sponsorship A Senate GOP source, however, noted that in the past the OGE paperwork hasn't always preceded hearings. For example, in 2001, Rod Paige, George W. Bush's nominee for Secretary of Education, had his hearing over a week before the committee received the OGE paperwork. Senate committees are set to begin confirmation for several Trump nominees for Cabinet positions and other posts next week so that they can be voted on and sworn in as soon as possible after Trump takes office on January 20. Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security nominee, retired Gen. John Kelly, are set for hearings on Tuesday. On Wednesday, hearings are set for Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson, whose close ties to Russia as Exxon Mobil CEO have come under scrutiny, along with Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary nominee Elaine Chao. On Thursday, hearings are set for Housing and Urban Development Secretary nominee Ben Carson and Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross. A hearing on retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, Defense Secretary nominee, is also scheduled. Democrats have already charged that Senate Republicans are trying to hurry through hearings for the president-elect's Cabinet, and the warning letter from the federal ethics watchdog gives that argument more weight. Schumer said in a statement that the OGE letter \"makes crystal clear that the transition team's collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these Cabinet nominees before they've been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented.\" \"The Senate and the American people deserve to know that these Cabinet nominees have a plan to avoid any conflicts of interest, that they're working on behalf of the American people and not their own bottom line, and that they plan to fully comply with the law,\" Schumer continued. \"Senate Republicans should heed the advice of this independent office and stop trying to jam through unvetted nominees.\" In a statement, the Trump transition team dismissed the OGE letter as overtly political and argued that \"the transition process is currently running smoothly.\" \"In the midst of a historic election where Americans voted to drain the swamp, it is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country,\" the Trump statement read. \"This is a disservice to the country and is exactly why voters chose Donald J. Trump as their next president.\" Shaub said that his office would \"continue expediting our ethics reviews of the President-elect's nominees to meet reasonable timeframes without sacrificing quality.\" \"It would, however, be cause for alarm if the Senate were to go forward with hearings on nominees whose reports OGE has not certified,\" he continued. \"For as long as I remain Director, OGE's staff and agency ethics officials will not succumb to pressure to cut corners and ignore conflicts of interest.\" In November, Shaub raised eyebrows when the OGE Twitter account posted odd tweets urging Trump to fully divest from his business interests. NPR later reported that it was Shaub himself who had personally directed the tweets. Tamara Keith contributed. ",

(Tribune news services) Santiago, who is in federal custody, will face federal charges and is expected to appear in court Monday, Piro said. It is legal for airline passengers to travel with guns and ammunition as long as the firearms are put in a checked bag \u2014 not a carry-on \u2014 and are unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container. Guns must be declared to the airline at check-in. Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale after taking off from Anchorage aboard a Delta flight Thursday night, checking only one piece of luggage \u2014 his gun, said Jesse Davis, police chief at the Anchorage airport. At Fort Lauderdale, \"after he claimed his bag, he went into the bathroom and loaded the gun and started shooting. We don't know why,\" said Chip LaMarca, a Broward County commissioner who was briefed by investigators. The gunman was taken into custody after throwing his empty weapon down and lying spread-eagle on the ground, one witness said. \"People started kind of screaming and trying to get out of any door they could or hide under the chairs,\" the witness, Mark Lea, told MSNBC. \"He just kind of continued coming in, just randomly shooting at people, no rhyme or reason to it.\" The Fort Lauderdale gunman said nothing as he \"went up and down the carousels of the baggage claim, shooting through luggage to get at people that were hiding,\" according to Lea. The killer went through about three magazines before running out of ammunition, Lea said. The gunman was arrested unharmed, with no shots fired by law enforcement officers, and was being questioned by the FBI, Sheriff Scott Israel said. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said 37 people were injured \u2014 scrapes, bruises and broken bones \u2014 after the shooting .

Caption Look Inside Plane Cabin During Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooting CBS Miami\u2019s Rick Folbaum reports. CBS Miami\u2019s Rick Folbaum reports. The condition of the wounded was not disclosed. At least one of the victims was seen lying in a pool of blood with what appeared to be a head wound. The airport was shut down, with incoming flights diverted and outgoing flights held on the ground. Airport Director Mark Gale said it will try to reopen at 5 a.m. Saturday but urged travelers to check with their individual airlines on flight status The bloodshed is likely to raise questions of whether aviation safety officials need to change the rules. The attack also exposed another weak point in airport security: While travelers have to take off their shoes, put their carry-on luggage through X-ray machines and pass through metal detectors to reach the gates, many other sections of airports, such as ticket counters and baggage claim areas, are more lightly secured and more vulnerable to attack. \"The fact is that wherever there are crowds, such as at our airports, we remain vulnerable to these types of attacks,\" Nelson said. President Barack Obama was briefed by his Homeland Security adviser, the White House said. President-elect Donald Trump said that it is a \"disgraceful situation that's happening in our country and throughout the world\" and that it was too soon to say whether it was a terrorist attack. Santiago's brother, Bryan, told the AP that his brother had been receiving psychological treatment in Alaska. He said Santiago's girlfriend alerted the family to the situation in recent months. Bryan Santiago said that he didn't know what his brother was being treated for and that they never talked about it. He said Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2. He was sent to Iraq in 2010 and spent a year there with the 130th Engineer Battalion, according to Puerto Rico National Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen. He later joined the Alaska National Guard. The Pentagon said Santiago had gone AWOL several times during his stint with the Alaska National Guard and was demoted \u2014 from specialist to private first class \u2014 and given a general discharge, which is lower than an honorable discharge.

    "text": "Turkish PM Visits Iraq Amid Spat Over Unauthorized Troops By sinan salaheddin, associated press BAGHDAD \u0097 Jan 7, 2017, 1:39 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Civilians return to their liberated neighborhoods in the eastern side of Mosul, Iraq, Friday, Jan. 6, 2017. (AP Photo/ Khalid Mohammed) 0 Shares Email Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim commenced a two-day visit to Iraq Saturday, the first since the two governments quarreled over the presence of unauthorized Turkish troops in northern Iraq , straining relations between the two neighbors fighting the Islamic State group. Meanwhile, Iraqi government troops made fresh progress in their push against IS inside the northern city of Mosul, dislodging militants from new areas and for the first time reaching the nearest point to Tigris river that divides the city since the operation began in mid-October. The presence of some 500 Turkish troops in the Bashiqa region, northeast of the IS-held city of Mosul, has stirred tension with Baghdad since late last year. Iraq has demanded their withdrawal, saying they are there without permission and are in \"blatant violation\" of Iraqi sovereignty. Turkey says the troops were invited by local Iraqi authorities and has ignored the calls. Shortly after Yildirim arrival, the Turkish Ambassador to Baghdad, Faruk Kaymakci, said on his Twitter accounts that \"We hope that his visit will open a new chapter in Turkey-Iraq relations.\" But emerging from an hours-long meeting in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone area, both sides seemed still far from resolving that issue. Iraqi Prime Minister Hiader al-Abadi said in a joint press conference the Turkish delegation \"stressed that this issue will be resolved in a proper way within the (coming) short period.\" For his part, Yildirim said the presence of the Turkish troops \"wasn't born out of pleasure but rather out of need.\" \"Iraq's sovereignty is very important for us, we will not allow or be involved in any attempt or move to hurt its sovereignty,\" Yildirim added. Both sides also said they had discussed the fight against IS, and the Kurdish Turkish separatist group known as the PKK, which has used Iraqi territory to launch attacks inside Turkey and target water supplies to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The issue has led to a war of words between the two nations' leaders as Iraqi government troops launched a massive military operation to recapture Mosul on Oct. 17. Ankara has insisted that its forces should take part in retaking the city, but Baghdad has refused. The issue of the Turkish forces in Bashiqa grew into a rare and bitter public feud last year between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. At one point, Erdogan gave a speech telling al-Abadi to \"know his place,\" and adding, \"you are not at my level, you are not my equivalent, you are not of the same quality as me.\" Al-Abadi responded by mocking Erdogan's use of a video messaging app during Turkey's failed coup last year. An Iraqi court later issued an arrest warrant against the former governor of Ninevah province, of which Mosul is the capital, Atheel al-Nujaifi, accusing him of facilitating the entry of the Turkish forces. The troops have trained Sunni fighters loyal to al-Nujaifi and Kurdish forces loyal to Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani \u2014 who both have sought greater power away from the Shiite-led central government in Baghdad. Turkey has also deepened its involvement in the war in neighboring Syria, where its forces and allied Syrian opposition fighters are battling both IS extremists and U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces. Last month, Russia, which backs the Syrian government, and Turkey, a strong supporter of Syria's moderate opposition, brokered the current shaky cease-fire, which came into effect on Dec. 30. Also Saturday, Iraqi troops pushed deeper into eastern Mosul, entering four neighborhoods, according to the operation's commander Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Rasheed Yar Allah. He said in a statement that the troops had \"liberated\" the neighborhoods of Rifaq, Atibaa 1st and Atibaa 2nd, as well as Ghufran along the Tigris river, but didn't elaborate on whether pockets of resistance still remained. Yar Allah also announced the capture of the Salam and Shafaa hospitals in the Wahda neighborhood as well as a 186-building residential complex in the northern Hadbaa neighborhood. Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul fell to IS in the summer of 2014 as the militants swept over much of the country's north and central areas. If successful, the retaking of the city would be the biggest blow yet to IS. Mosul is the largest remaining city in the self-declared IS \"caliphate\" spanning Iraq and Syria. Elsewhere, Turkish fighter jets struck 11 Kurdish militant targets around Qandil in northern Iraq Friday, according to Turkey's military. F-16s and F-4s pounded rebel positions, shelters and ammunition depots belonging to the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers' Party, the military said in a written statement. The PKK, which has been fighting an insurgency since 1984, resumed attacks in Turkey after a fragile peace process with the government collapsed in 2015. The group is considered a terror organization by Turkey and its western allies. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Zeynep Bilginsoy and Michael Corder in Istanbul and Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Reena Flores CBS News January 7, 2017, 10:42 AM Obama \"heartbroken\" after Fort Lauderdale shooting President Obama said on Friday he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d for the families of victims of the Fort Lauderdale shooting , giving his first comments on the tragedy in an interview with ABC News. Asked if the shooting was an act of terrorism, the president declined to say. \u201cAs a general rule, until I\u2019ve got all the information, I don\u2019t want to comment on it -- other than just to say how heartbroken we are for the families who\u2019ve been affected,\u201d Mr. Obama told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d in an interview to air Sunday. Five people were killed Friday, with six more wounded, after authorities said\u00a0 Esteban Santiago , a 26-year-old from Alaska, opened fire in the baggage claim area of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s airport. Santiago, an Army veteran who had served in Iraq, allegedly took a firearm from his checked bag and shot at travelers until his handgun ran out of ammunition. A U.S. law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CBS News that Santiago has no known connections to terror groups. His brother has said Santiago was receiving psychological treatment. \u201cThese kinds of tragedies have happened too often during the years that I\u2019ve been president,\u201d Mr. Obama went on. Of the victims\u2019 families, he said that \u201cthe pain, the grief, the shock that they must be going through is enormous.\u201d The president said he had asked his staff to reach out to Fort Lauderdale\u2019s mayor and \u201cmake sure coordination between state and local officials is what it should be.\u201d \u201cBut I think we\u2019ll find out over the next 24 hours exactly how this happened and what motivated this individual,\u201d he added. President-elect Donald Trump, whose inauguration ceremony is in two weeks, also weighed in on the \u201cterrible situation\u201d in Florida. He tweeted Friday, saying he had spoken to Rick Scott, the state\u2019s governor, and urged everyone to \u201cStay safe!\u201d Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida.

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Ed O'Keefe and Sean Sullivan January 7 at 6:03 PM Follow @edatpost Follow @WaPoSean A top ethics official has warned that plans to confirm Donald Trump\u2019s top Cabinet choices before background examinations are complete are unprecedented and have overwhelmed government investigators responsible for the reviews. The concerns prompted Democrats on Saturday to call for delaying the confirmation process, but Republicans signaled they are unlikely to budge on the eve of a slew of hearings in the Senate. The Trump administration-in-waiting faces its first big test in coming days, with as many as seven nominees for Cabinet positions \u2014 many of them already the subject of questions about their qualifications \u2014 scheduled to appear on Capitol Hill. The process begins Tuesday, when Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s controversial nominee for attorney general, is scheduled to begin two days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But the big show is planned for Wednesday, when five hearings are scheduled, bringing a marathon of nationally televised scrutiny to the thin public records and vast wealth of many of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. Democrats have vowed to cast the hearings as a proxy test of Trump himself, in hopes of discrediting his new government before it begins. They hope to remind the public of the president-elect\u2019s own lack of government experience and reluctance to separate himself from an entanglement of global business interests while he leads the nation. View Graphic Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far But even Democrats acknowledge that Trump\u2019s slate of Cabinet picks will probably sail through. The packed schedule, similar to those for nominees of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was orchestrated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the Trump team. In addition, Trump has scheduled a news conference Wednesday that will overlap with several hearings, at which he has promised to talk about separating his presidency from his business interests. Whether the schedule holds in the coming days is unclear. McConnell\u2019s office declined to respond to warnings by Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, who said in a letter released Friday the current confirmation calendar is \u201cof great concern to me\u201d because nominees have not completed a required ethics review before their hearings. [ Ethics office warns that Trump, GOP rushing Cabinet confirmations ] The schedule \u201chas created undue pressure on OGE\u2019s staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews,\u201d Shaub wrote in response to an inquiry by Democratic senators . \u201cMore significantly, it has left some of the nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues shortly before their scheduled hearings.\u201d Shaub added: \u201cI am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.\u201d Republican aides have disputed that notion, saying that in some cases, nominees of both parties have sat for hearings before the paperwork process was completed. But Democrats struck back Saturday, saying that hearings should be delayed until all paperwork is completed. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said consideration of GOP power broker Betsy DeVos to be education secretary should be postponed until OGE finishes reviewing her background and financial investments for possible conflicts of interest or other ethics concerns. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) [ Democrats seek to delay confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, citing unfinished ethics review ] Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) condemned what he called a lack of cooperation and communication by the Trump transition and asked for a \u201ctimeout\u201d on consideration of nominees until such basic information as an ethics agreement is available to members of the Senate. \u201cWe should put all of these on hold until the background checks by the FBI and the ethics office reports are completed,\u201d he said in an interview Saturday. The OGE enforces federal ethics rules and reviews potential conflicts of interest for nominees to government posts. Shaub, a lawyer and political appointee of President Obama, took over the office in 2013. He donated a total of $500 to Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, federal elections records show. Ethics experts from both political parties expressed dismay at the possibility that confirmation hearings would proceed before the OGE reviews are completed. \u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said Trevor Potter, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission who has served as counsel to several Republican presidential candidates and Cabinet nominees in the past. \u201cThis suggests that there has been a real breakdown between the transition and the Office of Government Ethics.\u201d Much of the attention this week is expected to focus on Sessions and his controversial record on civil rights, and on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state, who has never served in the public sector. [ Jeff Sessions\u2019s comments on race: For the record ] Tillerson is scheduled to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday. The health and education panel is set to consider DeVos the same day, while the Senate Intelligence Committee has announced plans to review the nomination of Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director. Elaine Chao \u2014 a former secretary of labor who is married to McConnell \u2014 is set to appear before the Commerce Committee to discuss her choice as transportation secretary. On Tuesday, in addition to Sessions, retired Marine general John Kelly is scheduled to testify at a Homeland Security committee hearing to review his nomination to lead the Department of Homeland Security. In a statement, the Trump transition team said Saturday that the president-elect \u201cis putting together the most qualified administration in history and the transition process is currently running smoothly.\u201d The statement added that \u201cit is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country. This is a disservice to the country and is exactly why voters chose Donald J. Trump as their next president.\u201d McConnell had already vowed Wednesday that \u201call the president-elect\u2019s Cabinet appointments will be confirmed.\u201d He called on Democrats to not delay votes on Trump\u2019s less controversial choices for national security posts, including Kelly and retired Marine general James Mattis, the nominee for secretary of defense. \u201cBasically, they can delay the process. They can\u2019t stop it,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said of his Democratic colleagues. [ Tillerson\u2019s Hill tour: No new friends, but some sympathy on Russia sanctions ] Republicans said they are proceeding quickly in hopes of confirming a handful of Trump picks on Inauguration Day, as happened eight years ago, when seven of Obama\u2019s Cabinet nominees were confirmed unanimously on his first day in office. But Democrats said Obama\u2019s nominations moved quickly because nominees had submitted requisite paperwork by early January. On Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Shaub\u2019s warning \u201cmakes crystal-clear that the transition team\u2019s collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these Cabinet nominees before they\u2019ve been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented.\u201d Murray said in an interview last week that Trump \u201cran his campaign telling people he was about jobs and workers. Many of these nominees don\u2019t share that view. Our responsibility is to make sure that we know what we are buying and the country knows what they bought.\u201d Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said: \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with more billionaires than we\u2019ve ever seen in one place in this Trump Cabinet. It creates a special challenge.\u201d Democrats said they plan to focus intently on nominees\u2019 business interests and financial disclosures. Several nominees, including DeVos and other picks not yet scheduled for hearings, will probably be grilled over past statements in support of dismantling portions of the departments they have been tapped to lead. Kelly, Pompeo, Sessions and Tillerson are the furthest along in responding to written questionnaires and divulging personal and financial information, according to Senate aides. But reviews by the FBI and OGE are still underway for most nominees, according to the aides, who are tracking the process but not authorized to speak publicly about details. Sessions\u2019s FBI check is complete, but other nominees have yet to complete all of the paperwork required by committees, because the FBI and OGE reviews continue, the aides said. Many of Trump\u2019s picks are widely unknown on Capitol Hill, prompting his transition team to recruit former GOP senators and the party\u2019s top-flight communications and policy talent to make introductions and assuage concerns among Republicans and Democrats alike. Nominees have been scheduled for more than 60 meet-and-greets with senators of both parties, according to Senate aides. Dress rehearsals to prepare for contentious lines of questioning have been underway for several days. Given Trump\u2019s refusal to release tax returns and other financial information during the presidential campaign, Democrats see his Cabinet choices as a way to revive the issue. But if Trump uses his scheduled news conference to divulge details of his finances amid a flurry of confirmation hearings, it may capture the news cycle and neutralize opposition. While each committee has different disclosure rules for Cabinet picks, just three panels \u2014 Budget, Finance, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \u2014 have the authority to require nominees to release three years of tax returns. Republicans have rebuffed Democratic requests to force all Cabinet nominees to do so. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, recalled that his panel\u2019s long-standing tax disclosure rules unearthed trouble for several of Obama\u2019s Cabinet choices, including former Senate majority leader Thomas A. Daschle, who was forced to withdraw his nomination to serve as secretary of health and human services due to questions about unreported earnings and gifts. With Democrats vowing to pepper Tillerson about his tenure as an oil executive, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, said the former CEO\u2019s decision to completely cut ties with ExxonMobil was \u201cresponsible.\u201d \u201cIt certainly takes away an issue that we knew had to be taken away,\u201d Corker said. \u201cI mean, my very first conversation with him \u2014 he knew that, Exxon knew that.\u201d Corker added that Tillerson will probably have \u201cone of the cleaner [financial] disclosures because his whole life and his whole net worth\u2019s been in one company.\u201d Some Democrats on the judiciary panel say they have no plans to give Sessions an easy pass despite his status as a well-liked senator and a former U.S. attorney. Several have vowed to rehash his staunch opposition to immigration reform, his recent support for Trump\u2019s call to require \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of Muslim immigrants and his civil rights record. Sessions was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 over charges of racial insensitivity and prejudice. [ Jeff Sessions should have been a tough sell in the U.S. Senate. But he\u2019s too nice. ] \u201cA person\u2019s whole lifetime career should be considered in such an important position,\u201d Blumenthal said in an interview last week. \u201cThis position is not just a government lawyer or another Cabinet position. It is the nation\u2019s chief enforcer of the rule of law, which is the bedrock of our democracy.\u201d Schumer said last week that Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and oversee changes to Obamacare, will endure heavy scrutiny once his hearing is scheduled. Price is bound to face attacks for his support for privatizing Medicare and over stock he\u2019s owned in health insurance, pharmaceutical and biotech companies despite serving on a health-care subcommittee. [ Here are the eight Trump Cabinet picks Democrats plan to target ] Schumer and others have called on the House Ethics Committee to begin investigating Price\u2019s stock holdings before his confirmation hearing. Republicans noted that several senators on the health panel have similar stock holdings. Democrats are also targeting Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), a fiscal conservative tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget; Andrew Puzder, a restaurant executive set to serve as labor secretary who opposes raising the minimum wage and has made controversial comments about women; Steven Mnuchin, a billionaire former Goldman Sachs partner set to serve as treasury secretary; and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who was picked by Trump to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, which he has sued in the past. Anticipating political combat, Trump\u2019s transition office has tapped incoming White House Communications Director Sean Spicer and Bryan Lanza, a veteran of the Trump campaign, to oversee hearing preparations. They are offering strategic advice and sitting in on practice sessions for nominees, according to R.C. Hammond, a transition spokesman. Party luminaries, including former Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and former Arizona senator Jon Kyl, are also on board to vouch for the nominees, transition officials confirmed. Kyl was spotted shadowing Sessions at the Capitol last week. Ron Bonjean, a longtime Republican operative who has worked for the Senate and House leadership, also joined the transition team last week as an adviser focused on the most politically sensitive nominees. Tillerson and Mnuchin, who some Republicans privately worry could face difficult exchanges with senators from both parties, are being assisted by several former officials from George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Mnuchin\u2019s team includes Tara Bradshaw, a Bush-era spokeswoman at the Treasury Department, and Mary Waters, an official in the Agriculture Department under Bush. Tillerson\u2019s team includes Christian Whiton, who worked at the State Department during the Bush presidency; and Margaret Peterlin, a former Commerce Department official and senior House Republican aide. Collectively, these former senators and administration officials, who come armed with deep familiarity with the arcane nature of the Senate and the complex policies a nominee will tackle, are known as \u201csherpas.\u201d But as one transition official quipped: \u201cThere\u2019s no climbing equipment or walking toward mountains involved.\u201d Karoun Demirjian and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Get ready for a rainy week, Los Angeles. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) Gale Holland Contact Reporter Scattered showers across Los Angeles and Ventura counties will gradually clear Saturday evening, with heavier rains to follow starting late Sunday and possibly continuing through Friday, according to the National Weather Service . Saturday\u2019s rain is part of a storm that is expected to pack a wallop heading into Central and Northern California later Saturday\u00a0before it doubles back south, bringing moderate to heavy rainfall Sunday night and into the Monday commuting hours in the L.A. Basin, said Robbie Munroe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. A second storm could hit Southern California late Tuesday and Wednesday, with a third to follow Friday, although that is less certain, Munroe said. While the storm\u2019s expected arrival in Central and Northern California later Saturday prompted official warnings of widespread flooding and epic snowfall, conditions in Southern California were much tamer. There was little more than a drizzle early Saturday in downtown Los Angeles, while steady rain fell in the San Fernando Valley, Santa Monica Mountains and Ventura\u00a0County, Munroe said. Sunday\u2019s rain will be quick-moving, with the heaviest downpours expected after midnight and into the early morning hours Monday, he added. Temperatures through next week are expected to reach the low 60s inland, about five degrees below normal, Munroe said. As the storms build, authorities will be watching for land-\u00a0and mudslides in burn areas left by the Fish fire\u00a0in the San Gabriel Mountains near Azusa\u00a0and the Sand fire near Santa Clarita, which are already saturated from December rains. But if hazards fail to materialize it \u201cshould be a good rain,\u201d Munroe said. Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Would a desalination plant solve L.A.

(Photo: Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports) FRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 James Madison still had one more game after dethroning the five-time defending champs in the Football Championship Subdivision. Now the Dukes have their second national title. The team that knocked off North Dakota State in the semifinals, and made the trip from Fargo to Frisco instead, won the FCS championship game Saturday. Khalid Abdullah ran for 101 yards and two touchdowns after two early TD passes by Bryan Schor as the Dukes beat Youngstown State 28-14. \"A lot of the country probably thought when we beat North Dakota State that we'd have a really great chance to win the championship,\" Schor said. \"Something we really focused on the whole week ... we have got to earn the right to win it, and that's something we came out and I think we did today.\" Schor threw two touchdown passes in the first 5\u00bd\u00a0minutes of the game, the first after James Madison blocked a punt and the other after a shanked kick set the Dukes up at midfield. \"We didn't start the way we wanted, and got behind the eight-ball,\" Youngstown State coach Bo Pelini said. \"The way we started didn't help.\" The Dukes won their other championship in 2004, the only other time they made it to the title game. \"It means everything,\" Abdullah said. \"It just means that all the dreams and goals we had as a team came to fruition.\" Abdullah finished the season with a school-record 1,809 yards rushing and an FBS-best 22 touchdowns. The four-time champion Penguins (12-4), who finished their second season under Youngstown native Pelini, made it to the title game for the first time since 1999. Their four titles came during the 1990s under Jim Tressel, now the school's president after winning a national championship at Ohio State in 2002. Abdullah's 1-yard TD midway through the second quarter made it 21-0. He added a 2-yard score early in the third quarter, capping a drive set up by Curtis Oliver's crazy interception after a pass that was deflected at the line ricocheted off the receiver's toe without hitting the ground. \"At the beginning of the year, every college football program has this goal,\" first-year JMU coach Mike Houston said. \"The great thing about tournament play is, it's not up to a vote system or anything like that. You go out there and play it out on the field.\" TAKEAWAY: Youngstown State \u2014\u00a0The Penguins couldn't overcome their own mistakes. The punting problems early put them in a two-touchdown hole, and their third possession ended with a botched snap on a field goal attempt. Turnovers on their only two possessions in the third quarter took away any chance of a comeback. Only Georgia Southern (six) and North Dakota State (five) have more FCS titles than Youngstown State. James Madison \u2014\u00a0The Dukes' defense was dominating again, with five sacks while forcing two turnovers (seven in the postseason). An interception upped their FCS-best total to 21. Youngstown State came in averaging 258 yards rushing, but had only 21 yards on 31 carries. LOST IN TALENT: James Madison TE Jonathan Kloosterman had a 14-yard TD catch less than 3 minutes into the game. It was his fifth TD on six catches in four playoff games . He had only two TDs in the regular season. \"I have such great talent around me and people tend to forget about me in the red zone,\" he said. END TO END: Youngstown State senior defensive ends Derek Rivers and Avery Moss both had a sack. The Penguins set a school record with 49 sacks, led by Rivers' 15 and Moss' 11. \"The emotion I have now is not because of the outcome of the game, it's because my last time playing with these guys in that locker room,\" said Rivers, who finished with 41 career sacks. \"I wouldn't trade the season we had for anything.\" UP NEXT: Youngstown State will travel to ACC opponent Pittsburgh on Sept. 2 for its 2017 opener.\u00a0James Madison, whose only loss this season was at North Carolina in the third week of the season, will open its 2017 season at East Carolina on Sept. 2. 48 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The schedule of hearings \"is of great concern to me\" and \"has left some of the nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues,\" Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, wrote to two Democratic senators and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0in a letter released Saturday. Senate Republicans are moving quickly to review Trump's nominees and have scheduled six confirmation hearings for Wednesday \u2014 the same day Trump is slated to hold his first news conference since capturing the presidency. Shaub said the Trump transition also broke with tradition and did not pre-clear any of its Cabinet picks with his office before announcing them publicly. The office performs reviews aimed at helping executive branch officials avoid potential ethical and financial problems. In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., seized on the letter to argue\u00a0that Senate Republicans and Trump are seeking \"to jam through these cabinet nominees before they've been thoroughly vetted.\" McConnell aides\u00a0did not have immediate comment Saturday afternoon on Shaub's letter. Trump has assembled what would be the richest Cabinet\u00a0in U.S. history. It\u00a0includes billionaires, such as Wilbur Ross, his pick for Commerce secretary, and Betsy DeVos, the\u00a0choice to run the Department of Education. Rex Tillerson to shed Exxon stock worth $180M+ as Trump confirmation looms His Cabinet's wealth and Trump's own far-flung business interests have put a spotlight on the work of Shaub's\u00a0little-known\u00a0agency, which is\u00a0charged with ensuring that everyone from high-ranking political appointees to government researchers avoids\u00a0conflicts of interest. The president and vice president are not\u00a0subject to the ethics rules that govern others in the executive branch. Trump is slated to detail how he will avoid potential conflicts during Wednesday's news conference in New York. Shaub has publicly declared that Trump should divest himself of his business interests\u00a0and also directed a tweet storm on the agency's Twitter feed in November, celebrating Trump's declaration that he planned to leave his real-estate empire.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The aging process is clocklike in the sense that a steady accumulation of changes eventually degrades the efficiency of the body\u2019s cells. In one of the deepest mysteries of biology, the clock\u2019s hands are always set back to zero at conception: However old the parents and their reproductive cells, a fertilized egg is free of all marks of age. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ten years ago, the Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka amazed researchers by identifying four critical genes that reset the clock of the fertilized egg. The four genes are so powerful that they will reprogram even the genome of skin or intestinal cells back to the embryonic state. Dr. Yamanaka\u2019s method is now routinely used to change adult tissue cells into cells very similar to the embryonic stem cells produced in the first few divisions of a fertilized egg. Scientists next began to wonder if the four Yamanaka genes could be applied not just to cells in glassware but to a whole animal. The results were disastrous. As two groups of researchers reported in 2013 and 2014, the animals all died, some because their adult tissue cells had lost their identity and others from cancer. Embryonic cells are primed for rapid growth, which easily becomes uncontrolled. But at the Salk Institute, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte had been contemplating a different approach. He has long been interested in regeneration, the phenomenon in which certain animals, like lizards and fish, can regenerate lost tails or limbs. The cells near the lost appendage revert to a stage midway between an embryonic cell, which is open to all fates, and an adult cell, which is committed to being a particular type of cell, before rebuilding the missing limb. This partial reprogramming suggested to him that reprogramming is a stepwise process, and that a small dose of the Yamanaka factors might rejuvenate cells without the total reprogramming that converts cells to the embryonic state. With Alejandro Ocampo and other Salk researchers, Dr. Izpisua Belmonte has spent five years devising ways to deliver a nonlethal dose of Yamanaka factors to mice. The solution his team developed was to genetically engineer mice with extra copies of the four Yamanaka genes, and to have the genes activated only when the mice received a certain drug in their drinking water, applied just two days a week. The Salk team worked first with mice that age prematurely, so as to get quick results. \u201cWhat we saw is that the animal has fewer signs of aging, healthier organs, and at the end of the experiment we could see they had lived 30 percent longer than control mice,\u201d Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said. Photo Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., has long been interested in regeneration, the phenomenon in which certain animals, like lizards and fish, can regenerate lost tails or limbs. Credit Concepcion Rodriguez Esteban/The Salk Institute for Biological Studies The team also saw improved organ health in normal mice but, because the mice are still living, could not yet say if longevity was extended. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte believes these beneficial effects have been obtained by resetting the clock of the aging process. The clock is created by the epigenome , the system of proteins that clads the cell\u2019s DNA and controls which genes are active and which are suppressed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story When an egg develops into a whole animal, the epigenome plays a critical role by letting a heart cell, say, activate just the genes specific to its role but switching off all the genes used by other types of cells. This process lets the embryo\u2019s cells differentiate into all the various types of cells required by the adult body. The epigenome is also involved throughout life in maintaining each cell and letting it switch genes on and off as required for its housekeeping duties. The epigenome itself is controlled by agents that add or subtract chemical groups, known as marks, to its proteins. Only in the last few years have biologists come to realize that the state of the epigenome may be a major cause of aging. If the epigenome is damaged, perhaps by accumulating too many marks, the cell\u2019s efficiency is degraded. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte sees the epigenome as being like a manuscript that is continually edited. \u201cAt the end of life there are many marks and it is difficult for the cell to read them,\u201d he said. What the Yamanaka genes are doing in his mice, he believes, is eliminating the extra marks, thus reverting the cell to a more youthful state. The Salk biologists \u201cdo indeed provide what I believe to be the first evidence that partial reprogramming of the genome ameliorated symptoms of tissue degeneration and improved regenerative capacity,\u201d Dr. Vijg said. But he cautioned the fast-aging mice used in the study might not be fully representative of ordinary aging. Dr. Guarente said it was more likely that the Yamanaka genes were not erasing the epigenomic marks directly, but rather were activating the genes which are responsible for the immense health and vitality of embryonic cells. This gene activation is a natural function of the Yamanaka factors. It is these embryonic pro-health genes that are rejuvenating the tissues in the mice, Dr. Guarente suggested, and causing changes in the epigenome through their activity. Thomas A. Rando, an expert on stem cells and aging at Stanford, said that it should be possible in theory to uncouple the differentiation program and the aging process, and that \u201cif that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, this is the first demonstration of that.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said he was testing drugs to see if he could achieve the same rejuvenation as with the Yamanaka factors. The use of chemicals \u201cwill be more translatable to human therapies and clinical applications,\u201d he said.

By Dan Balz Chief correspondent January 7 at 4:54 PM Follow @danbalz President-elect Donald Trump has made plenty of news since he won the election, but the coming week should be the most important of the pre-inaugural period by far, a moment when tweets and mixed signals could give way to greater clarity about the incoming president and his administration. For weeks Trump has been mostly out of sight, heard from mostly in random, 140-character bursts that have rattled cages from Capitol Hill to corporate boardrooms to world capitals. But for all the running commentary, Trump\u2019s transition has been particularly opaque. Over the next week, he and many of his Cabinet nominees will all be out in public, providing answers that could start to bring his administration into sharper focus. The focal point will be Trump\u2019s news conference Wednesday in New York, with two issues uppermost: how he answers questions about the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails; and how he explains the steps he plans to take with his business enterprises to avoid conflicts of interest as president. Confirmation hearings are scheduled for a slew of his Cabinet picks, so many there won\u2019t be enough television screens to accommodate them all. They include two of the most controversial nominees: Exxon\u2019s Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state; and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the early Trump supporter named to be attorney general. The many confirmation hearings are likely to be overshadowed by Trump\u2019s event, but they deserve as much attention as can be given. The coincidence in timing for Trump\u2019s news conference couldn\u2019t have been written better by a Hollywood scriptwriter. The president-elect hasn\u2019t met with the press corps for a full-fledged question-and-answer session since last July (days after the first DNC emails were leaked by WikiLeaks), when he approvingly called on the Russians to find and reveal emails from Clinton\u2019s private server. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post) \u201cThey probably have them,\u201d he said that day. \u201cI\u2019d like to have them released.\u201d He has sung a different song about the Russians since then. Could he have imagined that questions about Russian interference with the election would be front and center as he prepares to take the oath of office? Trump\u2019s decision to delay until next week a scheduled December news conference puts him up against the release of a declassified version of the intelligence findings that pinned the orders to interfere in the election squarely on Russian President Vladimir Putin and that ascribed the Russians\u2019 motivation as intending to hurt Clinton and help him. That leaves Trump open to more pointed questions about the Russians\u2019 role and motivations and his confidence level \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 in the intelligence community he will soon oversee \u2014 all of which he has avoided since winning the presidency. [ Read the declassified intelligence report on Russian hacking ] Nothing has caused more consternation \u2014 among leading Republicans and more broadly \u2014 than the president-elect\u2019s disparagement of the intelligence community\u2019s findings. Trump\u2019s written statement after being briefed on the findings did pay respect to the men and women in the intelligence community and called for stepped-up efforts to combat future cyberattacks. Republicans found reasons to be reassured by what he said, but some will need to see more. Notably, however, Trump stopped short of declaring he now accepts that the Russians were solely responsible for what happened during the campaign, the DNC hacking and other nefarious activities. He also claimed incorrectly that the intelligence report said the interference did not affect the outcome of the election. The report drew no conclusion on that point. Trump also will have an opportunity to explain why he resisted the conclusions of the intelligence community, why he gave more credence to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks (Trump said later that wasn\u2019t his intent) and whether the new report has changed his perspective in any significant ways. (Courtesy of The University of Chicago Institute of Politics) Led by Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Republicans have sought to put Trump in a position of having to choose between the U.S. intelligence community that Trump will soon oversee and Assange, who says that the information he released did not come from the Russians. Trump has been determined to avoid being pinned down. Trump\u2019s motivations for his multiple tweets questioning whether the Russians were to blame are not clear. Is he worried that any suggestion of Russian interference aimed at helping him diminishes his victory? He told Mike Shear of the New York Times that the whole issue is part of a \u201cpolitical witch hunt,\u201d presumably designed to delegitimize his presidency. Trump would like the whole issue to go away, but there was enough history before the hacking to raise questions about why he has treated Putin with such respect. Is that friendly posture a genuine effort to recast U.S.-Russian relations with a goal of making them more productive \u2014 without making concessions to an adversary? [ One administration, two styles \u2014 Trump and Pence and the future ] Is Trump\u2019s reluctance caused, perhaps, by business relationships with Russians that he does not want jeopardized or exposed? He has said no, but the full extent of his business arrangements isn\u2019t fully known. Is he, in some clever way, playing Putin on his way into the Oval Office with some clear strategic purpose? Should Putin be nervous about getting what he wished for: a Trump presidency? Meanwhile, Tillerson will be going through his own grilling before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His relationship with Putin while serving as chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil has put Republicans such as McCain on edge, fearful of a pro-Russian tilt in the new administration. Tillerson\u2019s private conversations on Capitol Hill, described by some of the senators with whom he met, have conveyed the impression that he will state clearly that he understands the difference between protecting the interest of shareholders and protecting the interests of the country. But where will that leave him with respect to the president-elect in his assessment of Putin, Russian aggression in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, the value of sanctions imposed and how U.S. policy could or should change after eight years of the Obama presidency? That\u2019s ultimately up to Trump, but will Tillerson act as a counterbalance or cheerleader for the instincts that the president-elect has shown up to now? Sessions can expect a modicum of senatorial courtesy, given his long tenure in that chamber, but however polite, his hearings will expose some of the rawness that remains in the aftermath of the election. No nomination has brought about more opposition from the base of the Democratic Party, particularly in the civil rights community. Although Sessions\u2019s nomination appears in no danger, his allies have worked strenuously to counteract the opposition and smooth his path. Beyond those hearings, Trump\u2019s choices for the departments of Homeland Security, Education, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Commerce, Labor and the CIA will have their moments in the public spotlight. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have set some clear priorities, along with GOP congressional leaders, starting with the dismantlement of the Affordable Care Act, several executive orders on Day\u00a01 designed to reverse some of President Obama\u2019s actions, and a focus on job creation and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Still, there is much that remains unsettled, both about those priorities and with other sensitive issues. Details will have to come eventually. How long will the president-elect, who has said many times he wants to be unpredictable, wait to begin to provide more answers? politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

During smoggy days, my mood is ruined and that I don't want to go out or work.\" As many as 32 cities in northern China were under \"red alert, \" the most severe pollution warning in the country's four-tier system, earlier this week. Another 27 cities, including Beijing, were under \"orange alert.\" People wearing masks dance at a square during a polluted day in Fuyang, Anhui province,on Jan. 3. Reuters PHOTOS: China Issues Red Alert Amid Heavy Smog China uses the Air Quality Index as a measuring stick for gauging the level of air pollution. The levels go from 0-500 and measure six atmospheric pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone among others. Once the Air Quality Index surpasses 200 for three or more days, it's an \"orange alert\"; once it's surpassed 300 for two consecutive days or 500 for any one 24-hour period, a city is under \"red alert\" and Chinese authorities recommend all physical outdoor activity be suspended. The United States' Environmental Protection Agency considers an Air Quality Index between 0-50 to be \"Good.\" Since the smog alert was raised on Dec. 31, Beijing has skirted on the edge of 300 and regularly surpassed it as it did on Jan. 3 when the Air Quality Index breached 700. For comparison, the Air Quality Index measured by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on Jan. 6 was at 298 , considered \"Very Unhealthy,\" on the same day in New York City the Air Quality Index measured 43 or \"Good.\" Winter is typically the most polluted season in China because the country burns more coal to power heaters. Manufacturers also often increase production ahead of the Chinese New Year, this year it will be on Jan. 28, also increasing pollution levels. Cold air inversions during the winter months can also trap smog lower to the surface. Cities under red alert must take measures to limit pollution \u2014 like limiting the number of cars on the roads and halting construction and factory production. Schools are also closed while residents are urged to stay in-doors and avoid physical outdoor activity. A woman wearing a mask walks past a construction site as smog continues to choke Beijing on Jan. 6, 2017. Ng Han Guan / AP For Maggie Li, the mother of a 5-year-old kindergartner in Beijing, every morning in 2017 has started with the same question: How do I get my child safely to school? \"There is nothing else I can do, I put a mask on my boy, but he was so frustrated because he could hardly breathe,\" Li told NBC News. Li bemoaned that the pollution has only grown worse over the years. \"I've been living here in Beijing for 40 years, so it is really hard for me to leave. But I do miss the blue skies from when I was a kid, the blue sky that my kid barely sees.\" Short, intense periods of bad air are commonplace in Beijing \u2014 but the fact that city has now been under \"orange alert\" since Dec. 31 is frustrating locals. \"I think it is pathetic that we have to purify the air with our own lungs, or wait for the wind,\" said Beijing resident Xu Huiren. \"The smog has been here since October and nothing is really improved till now. I feel like nobody is working for environmental protection.\" Even Chinese state media has been critical over the smog, with the reliably nationalist Global Times newspaper noting in an article on Jan. 4 that, \"the heavy smog has also been corroding the government's credibility.\" Beijing is well aware of the growing public backlash on air pollution. It is currently in the third year of a public campaign against smog as it tries to walk back environmental damage caused by three decades of breakneck economic development. While organizations like Greenpeace report some progress has been made in cleaning up the air, China's own Ministry of Environmental Protection reports nearly 62% of Chinese cities are still coping with severe air pollution. In a nod to the growing concerns of parents in the region and the outrage starting to spill into Chinese society, the Beijing city government announced Jan. 6 in local media that a new initiative was being started to fund the installation of air purifiers in kindergartens, primary and middle schools in the capital. The move will likely mollify families, many of whom have already invested thousands of dollars in their own home air purifying systems and masks to combat pollution at home. Despite the air pollution and the need for extreme precautionary measures, many \u2014 like the student Jiang who wears a face mask \u2014 plan to stay in Beijing because job prospects are still good. \"Today I just want to work hard and have no intention of leaving Beijing,\" said Jiang. \"But in the future when I have children if there is no sign of environment improvement here, I will consider moving somewhere else.\" NBC News' Dawn Liu and Sami Tseng contributed to this report.

    "text": "The FBI says Esteban Santiago-Ruiz, the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting suspect and U.S. Army veteran, first popped up on their radar two months... Santiago , 26, had trouble controlling his anger after serving in Iraq and told his brother that he felt he was being chased and controlled by the CIA through secret online messages. When he told agents at an FBI field office his paranoid thoughts in November, he was evaluated for four days, then released without any follow-up medication or therapy.\u00a0 \u201cThe FBI failed there,\u201d Bryan Santiago told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about someone who emerged from anonymity to do something like this.\u201d Speaking in Spanish outside his family\u2019s house in Penuelas, the brother said: \u201cThe federal government already knew about this for months, they had been evaluating him for a while, but they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u00a0 Bryan Santiago speaks about his brother Esteban, a man accused of shooting five people at a Florida airport, in Penuelas, Puerto Rico, Jan. 7, 2017. AP A law enforcement source said when Santiago -- who had been living in Anchorage, Alaska -- walked into the FBI office in November, he had a handgun in his possession, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. It is not known if the handgun was the 9mm handgun that authorities said Santiago used in the Florida attack on Friday.\u00a0 The weapon had been taken away when he entered the FBI reception area and was held while he was interviewed by the FBI, Milton reports. When the Anchorage Police Department transported Santiago to the hospital, they took possession of the weapon. The law enforcement source said that apparently the police department returned the weapon to Santiago after he received a medical evaluation. A U.S. law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CBS News that Santiago had said that his mind was being controlled by the CIA and the U.S. government and that he was being forced to watch videos from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The FBI office in Alaska declined to comment ahead of a Saturday news conference. There were other signs of trouble. Santiago was charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend\u2019s Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents.\u00a0 A month later, municipal prosecutors said he violated the conditions of his release when officers found him at her home during a routine check. He told police he had lived there since he was released from custody the previous month. His Anchorage attorney, Max Holmquist, declined to discuss his client. Bryan Santiago said his brother had requested psychological help but barely received any. \u201cI told him to go to church or to seek professional help,\u201d he said. Family members have said Esteban Santiago changed after serving a yearlong tour in Iraq. He was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007. He deployed in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion, according to Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen. Esteban Santiago\u2019s mother wiped tears from her eyes as she stood inside a screen door Saturday. She said her son had been tremendously affected by seeing a bomb explode near two friends while serving in Iraq.\u00a0 Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, a Guard spokeswoman, told The New York Times that two soldiers in Santiago\u2019s company had died during his stint in Iraq. Former neighbor Ursula Candelario in Penuelas recalled seeing Esteban Santiago grow up and said people used to salute him after he joined the Guard. \u201cHe was very peaceful, very educated, very serious,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in shock. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Since returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Anchorage, Olmstead said. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for \u201cunsatisfactory performance.\u201d His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said. She would not elaborate on his discharge. The Pentagon said he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged. ",

Lynne Sladky/AP hide caption toggle caption Lynne Sladky/AP People stand on the tarmac at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida on Friday after a shooter opened fire inside a terminal, killing at least five people and wounding eight others before being taken into custody. Lynne Sladky/AP Updated at 11:00 p.m. ET At least five people were killed and six others were injured in a shooting Friday afternoon at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida, according to the Broward County Sheriff's Office. The suspect, Esteban Santiago, was taken into custody \"without incident\" by a sheriff's deputy immediately after the shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference. Israel had said earlier in the day that \"at this point it looks like he acted alone.\" Authorities said Santiago took flights from Alaska to Minnesota, finally landing in Fort Lauderdale, where he took a firearm out of his checked baggage and \"began indiscriminately shooting,\" as Israel put it. Santiago is in federal custody, Israel said, and has been interviewed extensively by FBI and Broward County sheriff's office officials. George Piro, special-agent-in-charge of the Miami field office, said at the news conference that it was too soon to say what the motive behind the attack was. \"We're not ruling out anything, including the terrorism angle,\" he said, adding that it was \"too early to truly know why he came to Florida.\" Piro said Santiago will most likely have his initial court appearance on Monday. Article continues after sponsorship Piro confirmed reports that Santiago, 26, had voluntarily gone to the FBI office in Anchorage in November and spoken with agents. News reports have said the suspect complained that an outside force was controlling his mind . Piro noted that the suspect stated that he didn't intend to harm anyone. \"We looked at his contacts,\" said Piro, \"did interagency checks and closed our assessment.\" He says the agents turned Santiago over to local police, who took him for a mental health evaluation. NPR has not confirmed any details of the suspect's mental health issues. Piro didn't confirm news reports that Santiago was involved in a fight before the shootings. \"I'm not aware of an incident on the flight or at baggage claim,\" Piro said. Israel described the weapon used in the attack as a semi-automatic handgun and said it was too early in the investigation to say how many rounds were fired. The sheriff said the attacker didn't make any statements while shooting. In addition to the victims who were killed or wounded by bullets, Israel said, some 30 to 40 people were taken to hospitals with other injuries. The airport aviation director, Mark Gale, estimated that authorities will have helped about 10,000 people with transportation, food and lodging because of the incident. Police Chief Jesse Davis of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport says Santiago departed the Alaska facility on a Delta flight, having left a firearm in his checked baggage, as required. Davis tells NPR's Richard Gonzales that Santiago did not draw attention to himself at the airport, was not previously known to the airport police and apparently was traveling alone.

Taimy Alvarez/Sun-Sentinel/TNS via Getty Images According to NPR's Tom Bowman, Santiago is a 26-year-old former soldier. Tom tells our Newscast unit: \"Military records show Santiago received a general discharge \u2014 rather than the top honorable discharge \u2014 from the Alaska National Guard in August because of poor performance ... Gun Violence Should Be Treated As A Public Health Crisis, Study Says \"Santiago received an honorable discharge from the Puerto Rico National Guard in 2013 and served with those soldiers in Iraq in 2010 and 2011. He was a combat engineer, a job that includes clearing roads and detecting mines.\" Tom reports that a U.S. official familiar with the investigation says, while serving with the Alaska National Guard, Santiago \"was AWOL on a number of occasions, would miss drills and was interviewed by Army criminal investigators at times for what they called 'strange behavior.' \" Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who traveled to Fort Lauderdale on Friday afternoon, told reporters he had not asked the federal government for resources and had not attempted to contact President Obama. The governor said he had reached out to President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who take office later this month. @reganmclellan and I are at #FLL but we are OK.  Heard people yelling & took cover. Then we all ran outside.  Very shaken up, but safe. https://t.co/NFQyFBgFrw \u2014 John Kaneklides (@KaneklidesTenor) January 6, 2017 Later, Scott's press office announced that he spoke with Obama following the news conference. National Security Council spokesperson Ned Price said the president \"extended his sincere condolences to the families and other loved ones of those killed,\" said his \"thoughts and prayers are with the wounded,\" and gave assurances that federal authorities would continue to help in the investigation. Israel said authorities were not releasing any information about the identities of those killed and injured or the identity of the suspect, including possible motivation and whether he arrived on an earlier flight. The sheriff's office tweeted that those who were injured had been taken to a local hospital. Shots fired at Ft Lauderdale Airport, suspect reportedly in custody pic.twitter.com/o0zVdI91Um \u2014 WSVN 7 News (@wsvn) January 6, 2017 Israel and the airport's aviation director, Mark Gale, both said there was no evidence any shots had been fired elsewhere in the airport or by anyone except the suspect in custody. Previous reports had indicated there might have been additional shots fired on the airport property. Israel said SWAT teams were moving through the entire facility to make sure it was safe. George Piro, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Miami Division, said his agents were interviewing the suspect and supporting local authorities in the investigation. Broward County Fire Rescue told the local CBS affiliate in Miami that a shooting was reported around 1 p.m. ET. The sheriff's office tweeted that it received a call about a shooting at the airport around 12:55 p.m. The airport said on Twitter that: \"There is an ongoing incident in Terminal 2, Baggage Claim.\" The airport has four stand-alone terminals , of which Terminal 2 is the smallest. It serves Air Canada and Delta Airlines. People who said they were inside the airport described seeing people running. Among those inside was former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who tweeted that \"everyone is running\" after shots were fired, and that police said there was one shooter and multiple victims. Shortly after 1 p.m., Fleischer tweeted that police were not letting anyone out of the part of the airport he was in. Television images showed hundreds of travelers standing around the part of the airport where the planes park. The airport said it had temporarily suspended all services and asked travelers to contact air carriers directly about flight information . The Federal Aviation Administration said a ground stop was in effect at the airport due to the incident. In a statement about two hours after the shooting was reported, the FAA said flights were \"not arriving or departing\" from the airport. Gale said people were still sheltering in place, and that it was unclear when the airport would reopen. This is a breaking news story. As often happens in situations like these, some information reported early may turn out to be inaccurate. We'll move quickly to correct the record and we'll only point to the best information we have at the time. ",

From self-driving cars and delivery drones to wireless wearables and voice-controlled smart home gadgets, CES dishes out a glimpse into the near future. And at the risk of overhyping what\u2019s to come, it\u2019s simply extraordinary. After roaming much of the massive showrooms, the following are just a few showstoppers from the 2017 CES. Phone it in While Barcelona\u2019s Mobile World Congress typically has all the coolest upcoming smartphones, Changhong\u2019s H2 \u2013 the world\u2019s first molecular-sensing smartphone \u2014 made its official debut at CES this past week. By partnering with Consumer Physics, the Israel-based maker of the SCiO sensor, and Analog Devices Inc., a U.S.-based semiconductor products and solutions maker, the 6-inch Android-powered H2 lets you scan an object and immediately receive feedback on its chemical composition \u2013 whether it\u2019s food items like fruits and vegetables, dairy products and meat; whether it is medication and even body parts. Simply point the miniature infrared spectrometer towards the item, then captured info is uploaded to a cloud database, and you\u2019ll see an itemized list of properties on the screen. No word on availability or price just yet.

While it might sound like science fiction, Kingston Technology Company chose the 2017 CES to unveil its 2-terabyte DataTraveler Ultimate Generation Terabyte (GT), the highest capacity USB Flash drive on the planet. With up to USB 3.1 performance, you could also speedily transfer large files to and from a laptop. Available in February and with no price announced just yet, this DataTraveler Ultimate GT is made of a zinc-alloy metal casing for shock resistance, and includes free technical support and a 5-year warranty.

Like its award-winning predecessor, it\u2019s called a \u201c2-in-1\u201d because the UltraSharp QHD+ screen is on a durable 360-degree hinge that lets you use it like a laptop or a tablet, when the display is bent back all the way (disabling the keyboard and trackpad while tucked underneath). Powered by a 7th Gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, this Windows 10 machine also boasts up to 10 hours of battery life between charges. ",

    "text": "By Rebecca Shabad CBS News January 6, 2017, 4:25 PM Report on Russian hacking released by intelligence community Email Last Updated Jan 6, 2017 5:01 PM EST Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign involving covert intelligence operations and overt propaganda to undermine faith in the U.S. election, disparage Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump\u2019s election chances, the intelligence community concluded in a report released Friday afternoon. \u201cWe assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,\u201d the report said.\u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump meets face-to-face with the leaders of intelligence agencies that he has challenged for weeks. Director of National ... The report, prepared by the CIA, FBI and NSA and released as a 15-page declassified version, said that Russia\u2019s activities during the 2016 election were part of Moscow\u2019s longstanding desire to undermine the U.S. democratic process, but their efforts were intensified this time. \u201cThese activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity and scope of effort compared to previous operations,\u201d said the report, which was presented to President Obama Thursday and on which Mr. Trump was briefed Friday . Russia\u2019s intelligence services, the report confirmed, conducted cyberattacks that targeted \u201cboth major U.S. political parties.\u201d As previously reported, the assessment confirmed the intelligence agencies\u2019 confidence that the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence service, used Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data publicly, and it also relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. In addition to those hacks, the report said that Russian intelligence gained and maintained access to \u201celements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards.\u201d However, DHS assessed that \u201cthe types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying.\u201d \u00a0 Kellyanne Conway, counselor and former campaign manager to President-elect Donald Trump, joins \"CBS This Morning\" to discuss Mr. Trump's Friday i... Russia also relied on its government agencies, third-party intermediaries, state-funded media and \u201cpaid social media users\u201d to wage a messaging campaign against the U.S. election. This was what Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said was part of a \u201cmultifaceted\u201d effort in his\u00a0 testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee at a hearing on Thursday. The three agencies made clear in their report Friday that they were only charged \u201cwith monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors.\u201d They did not make an assessment on whether Russia\u2019s activities had an outcome on the election -- they do not analyze \u201cUS political processes or US public opinion,\u201d the report said. Moscow, the report surmised, learned lessons from this Putin-ordered campaign that will be used to \u201cfuture influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes.\u201d A short time earlier Friday, Mr. Trump was briefed on the intelligence community\u2019s findings by Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Adm. Mike Rogers. Following the briefing at Trump Tower in New York, Mr. Trump released a statement on what he called a \u201cconstructive meeting and conversation\u201d saying that the cyberattacks had \u201cno effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d \u201cWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Earlier Friday, the intelligence chiefs briefed senior lawmakers. \u201cIt was really quite a stunning disclosure ,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said at her weekly press conference. \u201cWhen you see this report, you will see with confidence how the intelligence community has identified what we have seen.\u201d\u00a0 Here\u2019s the full declassified report: ",

Some Democratic House members attempted to object to some states Electoral College votes to protest the election results. But their objections went nowhere because they were unable to gain the support of a senator, per the rules. Despite protests, the final vote tally was: Donald Trump: 304 electoral votes Hillary Clinton: 227 Ohio Gov. John Kasich: 1 Former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas: 1 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: 1 Faith of Spotted Eagle: 1 Democrats objected 11 times, citing a variety of issues, including \"Russian interference,\" \"massive voter suppression\" and the \"violation of the Voting Rights Act.\" Vice President Joe Biden, who sat in the chair and presided over the 41 minute-long process in the House chamber, attempted to speed through the objections. After the third objection and the third time Biden asked if a senator had signed on, Biden said, \"it is over.\" But a handful of Democratic House members continued to object during specific states and tried to continue their speeches even after Biden gaveled them down and said debate is not allowed. After the states were counted, three citizens in the audience gallery stood up to demonstrate. At one point, Rep. Maxine Watters, D-Calif., stood and asked for a senator to join them. Only four Democratic senators attended the ceremony. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said it was \"embarrassing\" for House Democrats that they couldn't get a senator to join the protest. But he added that Republicans were prepared in case an objection succeeded. \"Senator McConnell made clear that people needed to delay their trip home in order to be here in case there was a need to vote,\" Cornyn said. \"That's why we were all in town.\" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said she was not encouraging objections but that she would \"support\" them. \"I think people don't want the day to pass without registering concerns,\" she told reporters Friday. \"In some cases, members are concerned about voter suppression, in some cases they are concerned about Russian influence on our election. There are a number of concerns. But it's not going to have an impact at the end of the day.\" Every objection must be made in writing and signed by one member of the House and one senator. In 2001, when Democrats objected after the contested election between George Bush and Vice President Al Gore, no senator joined an objection then either. During that process, Gore, as vice-president, presided over the process. Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

Joshua was left in the parking lot with four gunshot wounds in the chest, one in the left hip, two in the buttocks and three in the left hand. \u201cMy mind-set was it was better him than me,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in fighting. I just pulled out my gun. I actually ran up to him when I shot him. I don\u2019t blame alcohol. I knew what I was doing. I just saw something in his hand.\u201d Joshua was unarmed, police said; Timothy\u2019s accomplice was never arrested. During pretrial hearings, Timothy would see Ms. Bergquist in the courtroom, and at one court appearance, he taunted her. \u201cI actually took her son\u2019s photo, and held it up and turned around, and that\u2019s when I laughed at her,\u201d he said. Video A Change in Perspective After awhile, says Timothy Shadid, he started looking at Josh Kalina's mother as someone he had hurt when he killed her son. By KC McGINNIS on Publish Date January 3, 2017. Photo by Christopher Smith for The New York Times. Ms. Bergquist, suffering from memory loss and insomnia, panicked every time she saw a tall African-American man \u2014 the loose description of Timothy\u2019s accomplice. \u201cIf I saw anybody with that vague description, I would just lose it,\u201d she said. Finally, wanting to avoid a trial, Ms. Bergquist agreed to a plea deal in which Timothy would receive about 20 years. Advertisement Timothy was impassive: \u201cI didn\u2019t care about life.\u201d Five years later, Ms. Bergquist still felt adrift. \u201cI knew that Timothy held the answers that I needed. I needed reassurance from Timothy that the other person was never going to bother me,\u201d said Ms. Bergquist. \u201cI needed to feel safe. At the same time, I needed to know if Timothy was working to change his life. I didn\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else.\u201d The first step toward a meeting came after a prison official showed Timothy an article that Ms. Bergquist had written about Joshua. Ms. Bergquist also contacted Holly Chavez, the restorative justice coordinator at the Kansas Department of Corrections, and asked whether a one-on-one meeting would be possible. Timothy was also growing more introspective. He was reading the Bible as well as a book that included a passage that seemed written for him: \u201cIf you always do what you always did, you always get what you always got.\u201d The solitude of prison forced him to try to figure out who he was. Video A Mother's Wish After Her Son's Death Judy Berquist says she wanted Timothy Shahid, who had fatally shot her son, to know the life that he had taken. By KC McGINNIS on Publish Date January 3, 2017. Photo by Christopher Smith for The New York Times. \u201cI had a lot of time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got to deal with a lot of stuff on your own. It made me go back and look at the things in my life. I became Christian. I understood forgiveness \u2014 that I took a life that I can never give back.\u201d What follows is a discussion of the reactions of Timothy and Ms. Bergquist as they worked with Ms. Chavez toward a face-to-face encounter. The excerpts, which are from separate interviews that took place after the meeting, capture the thinking of those involved. \u201cIf she wanted to talk,\u201d Timothy decided, \u201cI would talk to her.\u201d Judi Bergquist, the victim\u2019s mother I wanted to know him, too. There\u2019s always something in someone\u2019s background that makes them who they are and do the things they do. I wanted to know what had happened to him. Holly Chavez, the program coordinator He would at first give short answers. And I thought, \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d Then the wall broke and the floodgates opened and I got a more human reaction. The pivotal moment came when Ms. Bergquist acknowledged that she knew her son was flawed. Timothy, who killed Joshua When Judi said she understood that her son wasn\u2019t perfect, that let me open up because some people depict their kids as angels. When she was ready to recognize the fault that was in her son, I was willing to talk about the fault in me.

By KC McGINNIS on Publish Date January 3, 2017. Photo by Christopher Smith for The New York Times. Ms. Chavez I knew she was ready when her face was at peace. Before, her jaw was tight. She was calm. I said, \u201cI think this is what ready looks like for you.\u201d After about seven months, Ms. Chavez decided it was time to sit down together. Ms. Bergquist My purpose in going there was to share Josh with him, because if he had known my son, he would never have done it. Timothy She started crying. She was hurt. To come face to face with your son\u2019s killer, you know, nothing can really prepare you for that. It was uncomfortable. Ms. Bergquist I had him watch my son\u2019s funeral. I brought pictures, caps and diploma from high school, the bells off his baby shoes, some pictures of his tattoos. He had gorgeous tattoos \u2014 one was of praying hands on his left forearm with his grandpa\u2019s rosary beads and handcuffs around the wrists and sun rays. I also brought in his shirt, which still had his blood on it from that night. We talked for four and a half hours. Timothy It humanized him to me and made me see how he was loved by her and her family. I took a part of them that I can never give back. Ms. Bergquist I cried when he first came in the room and maybe when I took out Josh\u2019s shirt from that night. It was cut up the middle, covered in dried blood and bullet holes. I laid the shirt out on the table, the whole room smelled of Josh\u2019s cologne. And I looked up at Timothy, and I said, \u201cDo you smell that?\u201d He said, \u201cYeah.\u201d I teared up, and I said, \u201cJosh is here.\u201d Timothy I was already crying and everything when I saw the funeral tape. She introduced me to her reality. I didn\u2019t try to justify anything. I shouldn\u2019t have killed him. When I saw him laying in that casket ... I took that joy away from them. Ms. Bergquist He started really apologizing. It was definitely genuine. When I left the meeting, I felt like I had been power-washed. I felt so at peace. I couldn\u2019t help my son that night, but I have someone here that I can help turn his life around, do better. We\u2019ve let him know we\u2019re there for him if he needs something. We want to make sure when he gets out he\u2019s set up for success and not failure. Timothy She said she forgave me. It was a relief because I really hoped she would forgive me. Ms. Bergquist I told him that I forgive him for what he\u2019s done. And I do forgive him. I can\u2019t forget what he did. I live with it. But I do forgive him. My head quit spinning. I\u2019m O.K. that my son\u2019s gone. I miss the little guy. I love him. I\u2019m at peace with his death. In April 2016, the two met again \u2014 this time at a victims\u2019 awareness event at the prison in front of inmates. \u201cShe called me her friend,\u201d Timothy said. \u201cA woman forgiving her son\u2019s killer and calling him her friend. And at the end, she got up and gave me a hug.

The British Red Cross says overcrowding in hospital emergency rooms has become a \"humanitarian crisis.\" The charity says it has dispatched volunteers to help patients go home and free up hospital beds. It claims cuts to social-care funding by the Conservative government mean some patients can't be discharged because there is no support available, putting pressure on hospitals. Government supporters say the Red Cross is exaggerating the scale of the problem. (Dominic Lipinski/PA via AP, File) 0 Shares Email Overcrowding in U.K. hospital emergency rooms has become a \"humanitarian crisis,\" the British Red Cross has said, urging the government to spend more on social care for the sick and elderly. The charity said it has dispatched volunteers in several areas of the country to help patients go home and free up hospital beds. It claims cuts to social-care funding by the Conservative government mean some patients can't be discharged because there is no support available, putting pressure on hospitals. \"We've seen people sent home without clothes, some suffer falls and are not found for days, while others are not washed because there is no carer there to help them,\" said British Red Cross chief executive Mike Adamson. \"If people don't receive the care they need and deserve, they will simply end up returning to A&E; (accident and emergency), and the cycle begins again.\" Government supporters and health service managers accused the Red Cross of exaggerating the scale of the problem. The often overstretched National Health Service generally sees a surge in demand during the cold winter months, and NHS England, which manages care in England, said Saturday that \"plans remain in place to deal with additional demands.\" The state-funded service, which provides free care to all Britons, is a source of national pride. It is also a political punching bag, with politicians, patients and health care workers trading allegations of underfunding and mismanagement. 0 Shares ",

The Larsen C rift on November 10, 2016.\u00a0 The Larsen C rift on November 10, 2016.\u00a0 (Handout courtesy of NASA/John Sonntag.) Chris MooneyThe Washington Post An enormous rift in one of Antarctica's largest ice shelves grew dramatically over the past several weeks, and a chunk nearly the size of Delaware could break away within months, British scientists reported this week. If this happens, it could accelerate a further breakup of the ice shelf, essentially removing a massive cork of ice that keeps some of Antarctica's glaciers from flowing into the ocean. The long term result, scientists project, could be to noticeably raise global sea levels by 10 centimeters, or almost four inches. It's the latest sign of major ice loss in the fast warming Antarctic Peninsula, which has already seen the breakup of two other shelves in the same region. These events have been widely attributed to climate change. The crack in the ice shelf, known as Larsen C, been growing at an accelerating rate. Since the beginning of December, it has grown about 11 miles in length, after extending 13 miles earlier in 2016. The rift has grown about 50 miles since 2011, to a length of almost 100 miles in total, and has widened to well over 1,000 feet. Now, only 12 miles of ice continue to connect the chunk with the rest of the ice shelf. When it breaks away, the loss would be of nearly 2,000 square miles of ice, say the researchers with Project MIDAS, a British government-funded collaboration based at Swansea and Aberystwyth universities in Wales. That's larger than Rhode Island and almost as big as Delaware. The consequences of the break could be dramatic. (Chris Mooney) \"When it calves, the Larsen C Ice Shelf will lose more than 10% of its area to leave the ice front at its most retreated position ever recorded; this event will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula,\" said the researchers in a statement about the rift. \"We have previously shown that the new configuration will be less stable than it was prior to the rift, and that Larsen C may eventually follow the example of its neighbour Larsen B, which disintegrated in 2002 following a similar rift-induced calving event.\" The British Antarctic Survey also released a statement on the growing rift, saying a huge iceberg is \"set to calve\" from Larsen C. \"Because of the uncertainty surrounding the stability of the Larsen C ice shelf, we chose not to camp on the ice this season,\" said David Vaughan, the survey's director of science, in the statement. The floating ice shelf is fed by the flow of ice glaciers that sit above sea level on the Antarctic Peninsula. As the shelf shrinks, these glaciers could flow more quickly - which would contribute to rising sea levels. Losses from the ice shelf alone, however dramatic, would not have that effect, because the shelf is already floating on water, just like an ice cube in a glass of water. Fortunately, the Antarctic Peninsula does not contain nearly as much ice as other, thicker parts of Antarctica, such as the West and East Antarctic ice sheets. The potential sea level rise if Larsen C is lost would be measured in centimeters; the sea level from these ice sheets could be measured in feet. Still, it would subtract a major, enduring geographic feature from the planet, and add to already dramatic changes that have been seen in the Antarctic Peninsula, the portion of the icy continent that extends northward towards South America.

A crack in the Larsen C ice shelf as photographed on November 10, 2016. (Handout courtesy of NASA/John Sonntag.) Two smaller ice shelves near Larsen C - Larsen A, and Larsen B - have already largely disintegrated. Larsen B has a remnant, but scientists have determined that this ice, too, could vanish before too long. They have also documented that following the collapse of much of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002, the glaciers behind it sped up their flow toward the sea. Now, the fear is the same process could be unleashed on the larger Larsen C shelf. The Larsen C ice shelf is more than 1,000 feet thick, and in spatial extent, nearly the size of Scotland. It is the fourth-largest ice shelf in Antarctica, although much smaller than the two largest, the Ross and Filchner-Ronne ice shelves. The Antarctic continent is ringed with ice shelves, which are the ocean-front portions of larger glaciers. But as the climate changes, these features have been thinning and in some cases breaking apart dramatically. ",

In 2015, Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Trump's national security advisor, attended RT's 10th anniversary dinner in Moscow and sat at a table with Putin. Flynn has acknowledged he was paid by RT, though he has declined to say how much. RT, the report says, collaborated with WikiLeaks as part of a Russian propaganda effort designed to discredit the United States. \"The Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet RT (formerly Russia Today) has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,\" the report says. RT's editor-in-chief visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August 2013, where they discussed renewing his broadcast contract with RT, he report says. \"Russian media subsequently announced that RT had become `the only Russian media company' to partner with WikiLeaks and had received access to `new leaks of secret information.' RT routinely gives Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States.\" At another point, the report says, \"We assess with high confidence that the GRU (Russia's military intelligence arm) relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.\" The unclassified report does not identify who transmitted the information or how. A senior official with direct knowledge, however, told NBC News Thursday that the U.S. has identified the Russian actors who turned over stolen Democratic material to WikiLeaks. The unclassified report was released shortly after Trump was briefed behind closed doors by the heads of the major intelligence agencies. After the briefing, Trump released a statement in which he called his meeting and conversation \"constructive\" and said he had \"tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women\" of the intelligence community. Related: Trump, Intel Agencies Can't Even Agree What Day It Is He did not, however, explicitly embrace the findings of the intelligence agencies that the top levels of the Russian government interfered in the election with the hopes of hurting Hillary Clinton and, ultimately, helping him. He referred to Russia as one among several countries that might have tried to hack into the national infrastructure, but emphasized that no effect on the outcome of the election had been demonstrated. The unclassified report laid out a series of \"key judgments\" about Russian interfering and hacking that goes back as far as 2008, and goes beyond political organizations. Related: US Has Id'ed Russians Who Gave Hacked Emails to WikiLeaks Russian Celebrations A senior U.S. intelligence official with direct knowledge confirmed to NBC News that the classified version of this report, which was briefed to President-elect Trump Thursday, says that U.S. intelligence picked up senior Russian officials celebrating and congratulating one another over Donald Trump's win. The source described the intelligence about the celebration as a minor part of the overall intelligence picture. \"Highly classified intercepts illustrate Russian government planning and direction of a multifaceted campaign by Moscow to undermine the integrity of the American political system,\" the official said.

    "text": "Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, a state-funded television network that broadcasts in English, who is cited repeatedly in the report, posted her own message on Twitter scoffing at the American intelligence community\u2019s accusations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cAaa, the CIA report is out! Laughter of the year! Intro to my show from 6 years ago is the main evidence of Russia\u2019s influence at US elections. This is not a joke!\u201d she wrote. Even Russians who have been critical of their government voiced dismay at the United States intelligence agencies\u2019 account of an elaborate Russian conspiracy unsupported by solid evidence. Alexey Kovalyov, a Russian journalist who has followed and frequently criticized RT, said he was aghast that the report had given so much attention to the television station. \u201cI do have a beef with RT and their chief,\u201d Mr. Kovalyov wrote in a social media post, \u201cBut they are not your nemesis, America. Please chill.\u201d The Kremlin, which has in the past repeatedly denied any role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee computer system, had no immediate response to the declassified report. Mr. Putin instead made a show of business as usual, attending a church service to mark the start of Orthodox Christmas. The report provides no new evidence to support assertions that Moscow meddled covertly through hacking and other actions to boost the electoral chances of Donald J. Trump and undermine his rival, Hillary Clinton , but rests instead on what it describes as Moscow\u2019s long record of trying to influence America\u2019s political system. \u201cRussia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on U.S. presidential elections that have used intelligence officers and agents and press placements to disparage candidates perceived as hostile to the Kremlin,\u201d the report said. This campaign, it said, blended covert activities like hacking with public action by \u201cRussian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries and paid social media users or \u2018trolls.\u2019 \u201d The public report did not include evidence on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates that intelligence officials said was in a classified version. Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian intelligence agencies at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, said he was skeptical of the accusation that Mr. Putin had ordered the hacking. All the same, he added, Russian spies, like their Soviet predecessors, \u201cdon\u2019t just collect information but try to assert influence.\u201d United States intelligence operatives, he said, have often done the same thing but the Russians, convinced that the United States orchestrated protests in Ukraine in 2014 that toppled the pro-Moscow president, Viktor F. Yanukovych , and other popular uprisings in former Soviet lands, \u201chave a more aggressive approach to meddling in other people\u2019s politics.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Particularly since Mr. Yanukovych lost power after protests in Kiev\u2019s Maidan square, Mr. Putin and his circle, Mr. Galeotti said, \u201chave a different sense of how the game is played. They genuinely believe that Maidan was engineered by the West\u201d and because of this \u201call bets are off\u201d in their view, a shift that has legitimized \u201cthe principle of regime change or at least regime disturbance\u201d through mischief making in the United States election. That Russia considers it possible to influence United States elections has been evident since at least 1968 when, according to Moscow\u2019s former longtime ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin, the Kremlin decided that Richard M. Nixon was \u201cprofoundly anti-Soviet\u201d and must be prevented if possible from winning the presidency. Mr. Dobrynin, in his 1995 memoirs \u201cIn Confidence,\u201d said he was ordered by Moscow to offer Mr. Nixon\u2019s Democratic rival, Hubert Humphrey, \u201cany conceivable help in his election campaign \u2014 including financial aid.\u201d Mr. Dobrynin related in his memoirs how he thought this was a bad idea but nonetheless made an oblique offer of help to Mr. Humphrey during a breakfast at the Democratic candidate\u2019s home. \u201cHe knew at once what was going on,\u201d Mr. Dobrynin recalled, and made it clear he had no interest in receiving any Soviet assistance. To try to bring about change that suited Moscow\u2019s interests, the K.G.B. set up a special department dedicated to \u201cactive measures.\u201d This unit went beyond collecting intelligence and embraced measures aimed at changing the course of events around the world. These included disinformation and subversion, often involving various front organizations and Moscow-funded fringe parties that worked to shape the politics of foreign countries. While propaganda and disinformation have long been key elements in efforts by both Moscow and Washington to shape events, Moscow, at least during the Cold War, went to extraordinary lengths to try and undermine foreign political figures it viewed as hostile to Soviet interests. The K.G.B. fabricated a bogus F.B.I. report that Henry Jackson, a strong critic of the Soviet Union who tried unsuccessfully in the 1970s to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, was a homosexual and attended gay sex clubs with Richard N. Perle, another anti-Communist hawk who was loathed by Moscow. Another target was President Carter\u2019s Polish-born national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski . This tradition of maligning Moscow\u2019s foes on the United States political stage continued in the prelude to the November election with state-funded Russian media outlets, particularly the television network RT, which broadcasts in English, giving extensive coverage to negative news and allegations about Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWhat we see now is a modernized version of the old tool kit of the U.S.S.R.,\u201d said Laurant Gyori, an analyst with Political Capital, a research group in Budapest that has studied Russian efforts to shape political events in Europe. He added that Russia\u2019s intelligence services, after a long lull following the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, had in recent years again switched from \u201cjust getting information to also getting influence.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Galeotti, the intelligence expert in Prague, cautioned that this mission to influence foreign politics was not a uniquely Russian phenomenon but had also been embraced in the past by the C.I.A., which, in the 1950s, sought to shape and subvert politics in countries like Iran and Guatemala. He said the United States intelligence report on Russian meddling in the November election had gone too far in projecting Cold War attitudes onto today\u2019s reality. He said it was a mistake to suppose that Mr. Putin had from the start conducted \u201ca Machiavellian conspiracy\u201d aimed at bringing Mr. Trump to power. More likely, he added, was that Mr. Putin was not involved or even informed about initial efforts to hack into the D.N.C. computer system but, informed after the fact about what had been done, \u201cdecided to act opportunistically\u201d and make use of the hacker\u2019s harvest of emails to try to tilt the election. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Russians believed for a minute that Trump could really be elected,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey were convinced that U.S. elites would ensure that one of their own would win. They thought they had a chance to do a bit of mischief but I think they were amazed, even aghast, at what happened.\u201d Oleg Matsnev and Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow.

No officers or passengers were wounded in the gun battle aboard the Milwaukee District North Line, though several officers did suffer minor injuries dodging gunfire from the suspect, officials said. About three to five officers with the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force boarded the outbound train at the Deerfield station around 10:30 p.m. after they tracked a man they believe was present at the scene of a fatal shooting in southwest suburban Evergreen Park on Thursday night, according to Tim McCarthy, Orland Park police chief and chairman of the task force. According to McCarthy, the suspect, a 32-year-old Chicago man, spotted the officers first and fled to the upper level of a double-decker railway car to avoid officers. As an officer attempted to arrest\u00a0the man, he broke free, pulled out a handgun and fired multiple shots at the officers, McCarthy said. After officers retreated to the lower level, at least one of the task force officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect, striking the man. The wounded man was taken to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The Lake County Coroner\u2019s office has scheduled an autopsy for the man Monday. The passengers that were on the outbound train were taken to a nearby retail store for safety and to be interviewed by police, according to Metra spokeswoman Meg Reile. The shooting caused delays of up to 80 minutes. Metra trains were operating again on the tracks as of 2 a.m. Saturday. The suspect, who has not been identified, is believed to be one of at least three people who fled the scene in the Thursday night shooting of David T. Murrell, 34. Murrell, of the Ashburn community, was shot multiple times at 6:45 p.m. in the parking lot of Walgreens, 8700 S. Kedzie Ave. Witnesses told police Murrell\u00a0was sitting in his car when shots were fired. He was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Just after the shooting, Evergreen Park police indicated that Murrell appeared to have been targeted, but declined to offer further details. The task force turned the matter over to the Illinois State police's Public Integrity task force, who handles all police-involved shootings outside of Chicago. ",

By Liz Sly January 7 at 6:03 PM Follow @LizSly Recruits at a graduation ceremony after completing military training provided by U.S. Special Forces in the countryside of Syria\u2019s Aleppo province. (Alice Martins/For The Washington Post) TAL ABYAD, Syria \u2014In a former high school classroom\u00a0in this northeastern Syrian town, about 250\u00a0Arab recruits for the U.S.-backed war against the Islamic State were being prepped by Kurdish instructors to receive military training from American troops.\u00a0 Most of the recruits were from villages surrounding the Islamic State\u2019s self- proclaimed capital of Raqqa, and the expectation is that they will be deployed to the battle for\u00a0the predominantly Arab city, which is now the main target of the U.S. military effort in Syria.\u00a0 But first, said the instructors, the recruits must learn and embrace the ideology of Abdullah Ocalan , a Kurdish leader\u00a0jailed in Turkey whose group is branded a terrorist organization by both Washington and Ankara. The scene in the classroom captured some of the complexity of the U.S.-backed fight against the Islamic State in Syria, where a Kurdish movement that subscribes to an ideology at odds with stated U.S. policy has become America\u2019s closest ally against the extremists.\u00a0 The People\u2019s Protection Units , or YPG, is the military wing of a political movement that has been governing northeastern Syria for the past 4 1 / 2 years, seeking to apply the Marxist-inspired visions of Ocalan to the majority Kurdish areas vacated by the Syrian government during the\u00a0war.\u00a0 Over the past two years, the YPG has forged an increasingly close\u00a0relationship with the United States, steadily\u00a0capturing land from the Islamic State with the help of U.S. airstrikes, military assistance and hundreds of U.S. military advisers.\u00a0 The gains have taken Kurdish fighters far beyond traditionally Kurdish areas into territory populated overwhelmingly by Arabs, threatening not only to stir up long-standing ethnic rivalries\u00a0but also a wider conflict. [ 10 new wars that could be unleashed as a result of the one against ISIS ] Turkey, which regards the YPG as an affiliate of Ocalan\u2019s Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, is enraged at the U.S. support for the Syrian Kurds, and this month called on President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0 to sever U.S. support for the militia when he takes office. As Russia, Syria and Turkey move closer toward a settlement to the overall Syrian conflict, the United States could also find itself at odds\u00a0with Russia over its military role in Syria.\u00a0 To assuage Turkish concerns and avert tensions between Arabs and Kurds, the U.S. military is channeling\u00a0weapons and ammunition\u00a0to an umbrella organization called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) , which includes Arab fighters as well as the Kurds. The goal, the U.S. military says, is to build an Arab force capable of taking and holding Arab cities such as Raqqa, thereby diluting the influence of the Kurdish fighters.\u00a0 U.S. officials and military advisers in Syria declined to discuss details of the training being provided to the Arabs in the force. But they said they were unaware that the Arab recruits were receiving\u00a0lessons in Kurdish political theory before their\u00a0U.S. military training. \u201cWhat happens to them before they come to us, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said one of the U.S. military advisers in Syria, who spoke on the condition that he not\u00a0be identified by name or rank.\u00a0 Manbij Military Council recruits graduate after completing U.S. military training. (Alice Martins/For The Washington Post) U.S. officials acknowledge, however, that the Kurds constitute more than three-quarters of the SDF coalition and are leading the fight on the front lines, making them the biggest beneficiary of U.S. military assistance.\u00a0 And it is the Kurdish vision of a future Syria that is being extended to the Arab areas that\u00a0are being conquered, despite frequent statements issued by the U.S. government opposing the Kurds\u2019 plans to create any form of new region in Syria.\u00a0 \u201cThe military support has boosted the YPG\u2019s confidence to move beyond Kurdish populated areas and grow their ambitions even beyond Syria,\u201d said Maria Fantappie of the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt has huge political implications not only for Syria but also for neighboring \u00adcountries.\u201d\u00a0 \u2018Democratic confederalism\u2019 [ ISIS has been a catastrophe for Sunnis in Syria and Iraq ] On a rare visit by foreign journalists to northern Syria, Kurds were eager to explain Ocalan\u2019s political theory, a mix of Marxism and the utopian dreams of a dead American leftist from Vermont named Murray Bookchin . It seeks to abolish states and eliminate the need for governments by putting communities in charge of their own affairs. Referred to somewhat vaguely as \u201cdemocratic confederalism\u201d or the \u201cdemocratic nation,\u201d the theory places a heavy emphasis on egalitarianism, women\u2019s rights and being kind to animals. SDF recruits read a book written by Abdullah Ocalan outside the school where they attend classes on ideology before going through military training. (Alice Martins/For The Washington Post) Originally envisaged by Ocalan as a way of achieving a form of autonomy for Turkish Kurds, who have historically faced severe discrimination by the Turkish government, the theories are now being adapted to the circumstances in Syria, with its diverse mix of Arabs, Kurds, Christians, Alawites, Turkmen and others.\u00a0 Far from seeking to redraw borders to give Kurds their own entity, along the lines of the region\u00a0carved out by Kurds in neighboring Iraq, the Syrian Kurds are seeking to apply Ocalan\u2019s vision of a borderless world to all of Syria and beyond, said Nusrat Amed Xelil, who oversees the ideological training of the Arab recruits.\u00a0 \u2018We don\u2019t want confederalism just for Kurds, but for all Syria, and even all of the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t recognize geographical borders between this area and that.\u201d\u00a0 \u2018There is no state\u2019 In the classroom in Tal Abyad, a majority Arab town on the Turkish border that was recaptured from the Islamic State in 2015, Kurdish instructor Agit Ibrahim Heso fielded questions from the slightly puzzled young Arab men,\u00a0dressed in new green uniforms and seated at desks. \u201cWhat is the role of the state in the democratic nation?\u201d one recruit asked. \u201cThere is no state,\u201d Heso \u00adreplied. \u201cThe state is an instrument of oppression.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between \u2018democratic nation\u2019 and the slogans of the Baath Party?\u201d asked another recruit, referring to the party of President Bashar al- Assad that has ruled Syria for the past four decades.\u00a0 The difference, the instructor explained, is that the Baath Party favors\u00a0Arabs, whereas Ocalan\u2019s theories apply to all ethnic and religious groups.\u00a0 In interviews\u00a0after the class, the men said they\u00a0were happy to embrace the YPG\u2019s ideology.\u00a0 \u201cIt is like having a democratic mother who does not discriminate against her children,\u201d said Louay Shammari, who escaped from an Islamic State-controlled town in Raqqa province last summer.\u00a0 \u201cIf we did not agree, we would not be in training now. We have to learn it,\u201d added Mussab Issa Sheikh, who is also from the Raqqa area.\u00a0 A large, faded portrait of Abdullah Ocalan is posted at the southern entrance of Tal Abyad. (Alice Martins/For The Washington Post) Analysts and YPG opponents\u00a0question how democratic or egalitarian the group\u2019s ideology really is. Dissent is not tolerated. Photos of Ocalan loom over town squares and in public offices, much in the way\u00a0Assad\u2019s portrait\u00a0dominates areas the government controls.\u00a0 Though elected councils are administering day-to-day affairs in local communities, real power is wielded by shadowy military commanders who have fought with the PKK in Turkey, said Rana Khalaf, author of a report on the Syrian Kurds\u2019 governance for the London-based Chatham House think tank. \u201cIn practice, they are as authoritarian as anyone else,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Kurds who support Kurdish parties that are opposed to the YPG\u00a0have been jailed or driven into exile. Those being targeted by the YPG also include people who support the mainstream Syrian opposition, according to an activist from the Arab town of Manbij, which was captured by the YPG and SDF last August. The activist has campaigned against both the Islamic State and the YPG, and the Kurdish militia wants him to turn himself in, he said. As a pressure tactic, the group is holding his brother, who is not politically involved, said the activist, who lives elsewhere in Syria and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears for his brother\u2019s safety.\u00a0 Potential contradictions Two young Arab members of the YPG say they joined the group when their hometown, Manbij, was recaptured from the Islamic State. (Alice Martins/For The Washington Post) Manbij offers an illustration of the potential contradictions of the U.S. alliance with the Syrian Kurds. The town, located in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo, is held out by the U.S. military as an example of a successful handover of power by Kurds to Arabs after an area is freed from Islamic State control.\u00a0 But the Arabs who run Manbij are adherents of the YPG\u2019s ideology, making them indistinguishable in Turkey\u2019s eyes \u2014 and in the eyes of local residents \u2014 from the Kurdish force, according to Aaron Stein of the Washington-based Atlantic Council. The YPG-backed Arab force in Manbij has already fought battles with \u00adTurkish-backed Arab rebels in the nearby countryside, and Turkey is threatening to launch an offensive to take over the town.\u00a0 At a recent\u00a0ceremony for 250 Arab recruits who had just completed training with the U.S. military near Manbij, the newly minted soldiers were told they would be heading not to the Raqqa front lines but to Aleppo, to confront the rebels backed by Turkey, a NATO ally of the United States. As\u00a0U.S. Special Operations troops looked on, Abu Amjad al-Adnan, commander of the Manbij recruits, rallied the soldiers to take the fight to the forces backed by \u201cterrorist Turkey.\u201d\u00a0 U.S. advisers are also present on the ground with the Turkish-backed rebels in Syria, setting up a scenario in which U.S. Special Operations forces embedded with opposing sides could confront one another.\u00a0 \u201cWe have taken prisoners who were trained by the United States, and the Turks have prisoners of ours who were also trained by the United States,\u201d said Abu \u00adAmjad,\u00a0who keeps a photograph of Ocalan as the screen saver on his phone.\u00a0 Read more ",

    "text": "Iran planned terror attacks against Israel advocates in Germany By Benjamin Weinthal,                                                                        The Jerusalem Post Published               January 07, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Iran\u2019s intelligence agency allegedly planned terrorist attacks against organizations and representatives engaged in pro-Israel work in Germany, according to German media reports citing the country\u2019s federal prosecutor released on Friday. Syed Mustafa H., a 31-year-old Pakistani who worked for the German Aerospace Center in Bremen, was indicted on Monday for alleged espionage. West German Broadcasting (WDR) reported Iran\u2019s intelligence agency\u2019s goal was to assassinate the former president of the German-Israel friendship society, Reinhold Robbe. From 1994 to 2005, Robbe served as a Social Democratic Party deputy in the Bundestag. He later served as the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces in the Bundestag. Iran\u2019s targeting of a German politician is the first reported case of an Iranian intelligence operation working to assassinate a government representative in the Federal Republic. Journalist Georg Heil, who wrote the WDR article, reported that Mustafa also spied on a French-Israeli professor at a business college in Paris. The professor and the college in Paris were not identified in the report. The WDR reported that a second Pakistani suspect was arrested but was later released due to insufficient evidence. The suspect scrubbed his entire computer server of possibly incriminating information and departed the Federal Republic after his detainment. According to the Berlin-based Tagesspiegel newspaper, Mustafa was likely working for Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps. Mustafa studied engineering at Bremerhaven College and provided PowerPoint presentations to Iran\u2019s intelligence agency. WDR said Mustafa communicated inaccurate information about Robbe. Iran\u2019s regime paid Mustafa for the information he secured, according to the indictment. He drafted a \u201cmovement profile\u201d of Robbe and surveyed the society headquarters in Berlin. According to German authorities, Mustafa\u2019s activity was \u201ca clear indication of an assassination attempt.\u201d Mustafa also followed Robbe during his commute on public transportation from his private residence to his office. The indictment states Mustafa had been in contact with a person from Iran\u2019s intelligence agency responsible for espionage in Europe since 2011. German media said Mustafa\u2019s espionage activity was part of a larger Iranian operation to target pro-Israel groups in France, Germany and other European countries. According to WDR, the motive for the attack \u2013 based on one security theory \u2013 is Iran\u2019s desire to retaliate against Israeli advocates in Europe in the event that Israel launched air strikes to knock out Tehran\u2019s nuclear facilities. Mustufa\u00a0is suspected of intelligence activity from July 2015 to July 2016 on behalf of Iran\u2019s regime.\u00a0 In July, a Berlin court convicted an Iranian man of espionage on behalf of Iran\u2019s regime. The 32-year-old man was sentenced to nearly two-and-a-half years in prison for spying on Iranian dissidents in Germany. The Jerusalem Post\u2019s review of German intelligence reports showed Iran ratcheted up its spy network in the Federal Republic in 2015. Iran has a vast espionage infrastructure in the country which coordinates with its embassy in Berlin.

(Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty Images) Friday's deadly shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport suspended all service until the airport reopened at 5 a.m. Saturday. Flights are currently operating, but travel disruptions will continue today. Here's what travelers bound to or from Fort Lauderdale need to know. Flight cancellations and delays. There have been 113 canceled outbound flights at FLL today, or 25% of the total flight schedule, according to FlightAware.com. Additionally, 103 inbound flights have been canceled (21% of all flights). Compounding matters is an eastern snow storm that has already caused cancellations at busy hub airports in Atlanta, Charlotte and the Northeast. You'll need to work directly with your airline for rebooking. Delta and Jetblue have announced they will waive change fees for fliers who need to rearrange their itineraries, and other airlines should be equally accommodating. USA TODAY Flight Tracker: Find out if your flight is on time There are other airports in the area. The greater Miami area is served by three major airports, Miami International, West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood. During the airport lockdown, some flights diverted to these airports (and also to RSW on Florida's Gulf Coast). Airlines will use many of these seats to rebook affected fliers, but be sure and check flight schedules from all three if your travel plans were affected. Missing luggage. As many as 20,000 bags were left in place as passengers evacuated terminals and aircraft during the shooting. Passengers missing bags or personal items left in the terminal should call the Broward County Call Center at 866-435-9355. For items left on planes, fliers should contact their airline. Cruise passengers. There were six cruise ships scheduled to leave South Florida's Port Everglades cruise terminal this weekend. Some ships delayed departures to accommodate passengers caught in the FLL lockdown. For passengers who couldn't reach their ships, cruise lines say they will try to help them meet their ship at\u00a0an early port of call. Passengers will need to work directly with their travel agents, cruise lines or travel insurance providers.

Cleveland officials say the search for a plane carrying six people that disappeared last week over Lake Erie has resumed. Tuesday marks the third straight day that conditions have allowed recovery teams to search the lake for a Columbus-bound Cessna 525 Citation that vanished from radar shortly after takeoff Thursday night from Burke Lakefront Airport. (AP Photo/Tony Dejak) 0 Shares Email Crews searching Lake Erie on Friday found what may be human remains on a seat from a plane that was carrying six people when it disappeared more than a week ago. Officials said Friday night that the remains were being analyzed by a medical examiner to determine if they are human. They said the remains were found on a seat from the plane's passenger compartment. Divers guided by an underwater detector earlier Friday found the cockpit voice recorder and pieces of the tail from the plane. They continued to search into the evening for the plane's fuselage debris despite rough conditions that limited visibility to less than a foot just off shore from downtown Cleveland. Authorities later said they had concluded their search for the day, would resume Monday and would be meeting to determine their next steps. They said they'd continue to search until they're confident they've found all they can. Transmissions from a locator beacon detector helped narrow the search area, but divers moved slowly as they followed the signals. Daytime temperatures have been in the teens throughout the search, and Friday's noon reading in Cleveland was 14 degrees with a wind chill of 3. The search by air and along the shore for debris continued as weather permitted. Investigators have said the cockpit voice recorder appeared to be intact and would be sent to Washington, D.C., for further examination. National Transportation Safety Board investigator Tim Sorenson said the review is only in the beginning stages. Searchers said previously they were looking for the cockpit voice recorder in an underwater area about 125 feet by 325 feet. They have found almost daily debris that is consistent with the Cessna 525 Citation, which vanished shortly after takeoff from Burke Lakefront Airport on Dec. 29. The plane was piloted by John T. Fleming, the president of a Columbus beverage distribution company. The passengers were his wife, Suzanne Fleming; their teenage sons, Jack and Andrew; and two neighbors, Brian Casey and his teenage daughter, Megan Casey, a freshman nursing student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The group was returning to Columbus after attending a Cleveland Cavaliers game in downtown Cleveland. Calling hours for the Fleming family will be from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday at Canfield Presbyterian Church, 140 W. Main St., in Canfield. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday at the same church. A second memorial is planned for 4 p.m. Tuesday at Liberty Presbyterian Church in Delaware , north of Columbus. Funeral arrangements for the Flemings' neighbors were not immediately available. The families of Fleming and his wife issued a statement thanking supporters for their concern and kindness. \"The families are touched by the tremendous outpouring of support and continue to be grateful to all the agencies and individuals who have aided in the search and recovery efforts, now in the capable hands of the City of Cleveland,\" it said. 0 Shares ",

Dan Coats to serve as national intelligence director, his transition team announced Saturday. Coats, would need to be confirmed by Senate for the role, served eight years in the House of Representatives and two years in the Senate. During the George W. Bush administration, he served as U.S. ambassador to Germany. \"I'm very confident that Senator Dan Coats is the right choice to serve as Director of National Intelligence,\" President-elect Trump said in a statement. \"Dan has clearly demonstrated the deep subject matter expertise and sound judgment required to lead our intelligence community.\" As director of national intelligence, Coats would serve as the head of the United States' intelligence community and be the president's principal adviser on the issue. Indiana Senator Dan Coats speaks briefly with the press following his meeting with US President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, New York, USA, 30 November 2016 AALBIN LOHR-JONES / POOL / EPA Coats will succeed James Clapper, who recently testified in front of Congress that Russia had stepped up its cyber espionage operation in an attempt to undermine the election. A redacted report about the hack and its goals was released on Friday. First elected to the Senate in 1990 in a special election that filled the seat vacated by Dan Quayle \u2014 who departed the Senate to serve as George H. W. Bush's vice president \u2014 Coats won reelection in 1992 before retiring from the Senate in 1998. He then was nominated to serve as U.S. ambassador to Germany in 2001, arriving there mere days before the Sept. 11 terrorism attack. After departing as ambassador four years later, Coats worked as a prominent lobbyist in Washington D.C. and then decided to run for his former Senate seat in 2010 \u2014 an election he won. Coats again announced his retirement from government in November 2015. Most recently while in the Senate, Coats served as the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \"If confirmed as Director of National Intelligence, he will provide unwavering leadership that the entire intelligence community can respect, and will spearhead my administration's ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm,\" Trump added in his statement. Related: Donald Trump's Cabinet Picks So Far \"I'm pleased to hear the President-elect has nominated my colleague and friend Dan Coats to be the next head of our Intelligence Community,\" said Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \"Dan's experience as a valued member of the Senate Intelligence Committee will help to guide him as the next Director of National Intelligence.\" In the past year as a senator, Coats has introduced six bills. Only two simple resolutions passed: The first recognized the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race and the other commemorated the bicentennial of the state of Indiana. Coats will lead an intelligence community that already has a rocky relationship with the president-elect, as Trump has continued to float doubts about the community's findings in the Russia hacking investigation. While testifying before the Armed Services Committee, Clapper stopped short of calling Russia's interference in the election an act of war, saying that was something for lawmakers to discern. Play ",

    "text": "U.S. consular official in Mexico shot in his car Amy B. Wang and Joshua PartlowThe Washington Post A U.S. consular officer in Mexico was shot in his car Friday evening, and the FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the identification of the shooting suspect. Surveillance video released by the Consulate General in Guadalajara showed a man in a purple shirt, dark pants and white shoes waiting near a garage Friday evening as a black vehicle pulls up to the exit gate. In the video, the man in the purple shirt points a gun at the driver and fires once, then runs away. The car lurches forward, then stops, as several people begin rushing toward the driver. The consulate also released other videos, both time-stamped around 6:15 p.m. Friday. One showed the man in the purple shirt in greater detail - and wearing dark sunglasses - as he ran behind a truck. In another, a thinner man in red shorts and a gray tank top is shown at a garage parking payment machine. As he walks away, the man in the purple shirt follows. The State Department confirmed Saturday that the FBI was offering a reward for information about the shooting but said it could not share additional details due to privacy considerations. \"The safety and security of our employees overseas is among our highest priorities,\" the department said in a statement. \"We are working closely with Mexican law enforcement in this matter.\" The wounded consular official in Guadalajara is Christopher Ashcraft, who is in his first posting with the State Department, according to a friend who spoke to The Washington Post on condition of anonymity to discuss the case. Ashcraft was coming out of a gym in Guadalajara in the early evening, around 6 p.m., at the time of the shooting, the friend said. According to the friend, an assailant reportedly asked for Ashcraft by name at the gym's reception, then followed him to his car. Ashcraft was shot while sitting inside the car, hit on the right side of his chest, said the friend. Ashcraft is recovering well at a hospital in Guadalajara and plans to return to the United States for a time, the friend said. \"He has no idea what happened,\" said the friend, who has been in contact with Ashcraft since the shooting. \"But it wasn't random.\" While there is no indication so far about the motive of the shooting, Guadalajara is the home territory of the Nueva Generacion cartel, one of the most powerful drug cartels in the country. In recent years, the cartel has been responsible for violence targeted against Mexican soldiers and police. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico encouraged anyone who recognized the suspect in the surveillance videos to call (01-55) 5080-2000. The State Department had already issued a travel warning for Jalisco, including Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta and Lake Chapala, citing \"continued instability.\" \"U.S. citizens should defer nonessential travel to areas that border the states of Michoac\u00e1n and Zacatecas because of continued instability,\" the travel warning reads. \"U.S. government personnel are prohibited from personal travel to areas of Jalisco that border Zacatecas, intercity travel after hours, and from using Highway 80 between Cocula and La Huerta. U.S. government personnel are authorized to use Federal toll road 15D for travel to Mexico City; however, they may not stop in the town of La Barca or Ocotlan for any reason.\" In recent years, a handful of U.S. consular employees and other U.S. agents have been attacked and killed in Mexico, according to the Associated Press. In 2014, a Mexican gang leader was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the 2010 slayings in of U.S. consulate employee Leslie Ann Enriquez Catton, her husband and the husband of another consulate employee as they left a children's birthday party in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the AP reported.

    "text": "Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said on Friday that Manson was back in jail. \u201cInmate Manson is at California State Prison-Corcoran,\u201d she said in an email, without elaborating. On Wednesday, Manson, now a grizzled, shuffling 82-year-old, lay hospitalized with an undisclosed illness after being taken from the prison, where he was serving a life sentence, according to news reports that correction officials would not confirm, citing privacy laws. Manson was convicted of orchestrating the 1969 murders of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six others. The cult leader attracted disaffected young people who lived in a commune, followed his orders and were ultimately turned into killers.\u00a0 After attracting a few dozen followers from San Francisco\u2019s Haight-Ashbury district, many of them young women, runaways or other lost souls, he took them to an old movie ranch on the edge of Los Angeles that he transformed into a commune of sex, drugs and music. On Aug. 9 and 10, 1969, he sent some of his devotees out on a murderous mission to two of Los Angeles\u2019 wealthiest neighborhoods, where they killed Tate, several of her society friends and others. Most of the victims, including coffee heiress Abigail Folger, were stabbed. Tate\u2019s husband, Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski, was out of the country at the time. Authorities would learn that Manson had hoped the killings would touch off a race war. He had apparently gotten the idea from a twisted reading of the hard-rocking Beatles song \u201cHelter Skelter.\u201d Both TMZ and the Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that Manson had been hospitalized. TMZ said he had been taken to a medical center in Bakersfield, about 60 miles south of the prison in Corcoran. Two vans from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation were parked early Wednesday outside Bakersfield\u2019s Mercy Hospital Downtown, where state prisoners have been treated before. Thornton then said that Manson was alive and assigned to the prison in Corcoran. She had declined to say whether he was at the hospital in Bakersfield, citing safety privacy laws prohibit her from discussing an inmate\u2019s medical situation. Tate\u2019s sister Debra Tate told The Associated Press on Tuesday night that, as a Catholic, she makes \u201cno ill wishes\u201d for the people who killed her sister, and will reserve her feelings until hearing Manson has died. \u201cI would probably say a prayer for them and shed a tear and ask God to have mercy on their souls, but so far I haven\u2019t allowed myself to feel anything because it\u2019s unsubstantiated,\u201d Tate said. \u201cI\u2019m not allowing myself to feel anything until I know that it\u2019s true.\u201d ",

    "text": "OPEN Graphic The report described a broad campaign of covert operations, including the \u201ctrolling\u201d on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russia\u2019s effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining \u201caccess to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,\u201d it concluded \u2014 as officials have publicly \u2014 that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8. The report, reflecting the assessments of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, stopped short of backing up Mr. Trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election. \u201cWe did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,\u201d the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze American \u201cpolitical processes\u201d or public opinion. The intelligence agencies also concluded \u201cwith high confidence\u201d that Russia\u2019s main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., created a \u201cpersona\u201d called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta. When those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention, the report said, the G.R.U. \u201crelayed material it acquired from the D.N.C. and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.\u201d The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has denied that Russia was the source of the emails it published. The role of RT \u2014 the Russian English-language news organization that American intelligence says is a Kremlin propaganda operation \u2014 in the Kremlin\u2019s effort to influence the election is covered in far more detail by the report than any other aspect of the Russian campaign. An annex in the report on RT, which was first written in 2012 but not previously made public, takes up eight pages of the report\u2019s 14-page main section. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More The report\u2019s unequivocal assessment of RT presents an awkward development for Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to serve as national security adviser. Mr. Flynn has appeared repeatedly on RT\u2019s news programs and in December 2015 was paid by the network to give a speech in Russia and attend its lavish anniversary party, where he sat at the elbow of Mr. Putin. Mr. Flynn has since defended his speech, insisting that RT is no different from CNN or MSNBC. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The report also stated that Russia collected data \u201con some Republican-affiliated targets,\u201d but did not disclose the contents of whatever it harvested. Intelligence officials who prepared the classified report have concluded that British intelligence was among the first to raise an alarm that Moscow hacked into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers, and alerted their American counterparts, according to two people familiar with the conclusions. The British role, which has been closely held, is a critical part of the timeline because it suggests that some of the first tipoffs, in fall 2015, came from voice intercepts, computer traffic or informants outside the United States, as emails and other data from the Democratic National Committee flowed out of the country. The conclusions in the report were described on Thursday to President Obama and on Friday to Mr. Trump by James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; John O. Brennan, the director of the C.I.A.; Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency; and James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I. The key to the public report\u2019s assessment is that Russia\u2019s motives \u201cevolved over the course of the campaign.\u201d When it appeared that Mrs. Clinton was more likely to win, it concluded, the Russian effort focused \u201con undermining her future presidency,\u201d with pro-Kremlin bloggers preparing a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #DemocracyRIP. It noted that Mr. Putin had a particular animus for Mrs. Clinton because he believed she had incited protests against him in 2011. Yet the attacks, the report said, began long before anyone could have known that Mr. Trump, considered a dark horse, would win the Republican nomination. It said the attacks began as early as July 2015, when Russian intelligence operatives first gained access to the Democratic National Committee \u2019s networks . Russia maintained that access for 11 months, until \u201cat least June 2016,\u201d the report concludes, leaving open the possibility that Russian cyberattackers may have had access even after the firm CrowdStrike believed that it had kicked them off the networks.

Here's what you need to know Mammoth snow Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times Mammoth Mountain employees clear paths as snow falls lightly Saturday morning. Mammoth Mountain employees clear paths as snow falls lightly Saturday morning. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) National Weather Service A series of storms that some forecasters say could be the most severe in a decade is  beginning to barrel down on Northern California. The epic system \u2014\u00a0known as an atmospheric river \u2014\u00a0could dump so much rain and snow that some ski runs and roads will be declared off-limits, with\u00a0forecasters warning of significant flooding, mudslides and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada. Up to 12 inches of rain is expected to fall on areas below 8,500 feet\u00a0beginning Saturday morning,\u00a0and up to 7\u00a0feet of snow could bury higher elevations, according to the\u00a0 National Weather Service .\u00a0Forecasters said\u00a0the storm was\u00a0packing the same wallop as one that hit Northern California in 2005, causing\u00a0$300 million in damage. This weekend\u2019s system could bring 36 consecutive  hours of heavy rain from Mammoth Mountain to Susanville, in Lassen County. Though  that\u00a0 is good news \u00a0for California, which is entering its sixth year of drought,\u00a0the coming rain could melt already standing snow \u2014 feeding watersheds swollen from storms earlier this week, forecasters said.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a busy weekend,\u201d said Edan Weishahn, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno, sighing.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of what you need to know. So what is the timeline for the storm systems in Northern California? There will be rain and snow at least through Wednesday. The worst of it will be Sunday, but the flood risks continue through mid-week. Here\u2019s a weather service graphic: https://twitter.com/NWSSacramento/status/817789860148875264 Why is flooding such a concern? Big storms like this \u2014\u00a0especially ones that come one after another \u2014\u00a0regularly bring flooding along rivers and streams. It\u2019s caused both by swelling from rain and the melting of snow from higher elevations. A wide swath of Northern California is under flooding warning: https://twitter.com/NWSSacramento/status/817550886511710209 ",

Then-President-elect Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, and daughters Sasha and Malia,\u00a0 onstage after Obama's acceptance speech in Chicago's Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2008. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy As the political stages got bigger for Barack Obama on the way to a historic presidency, so did the size of the rooms he commanded in his adopted city. Small, at the beginning. The cozy Hyde Park Ramada Inn near the lake to kick off his 1996 state Senate bid. To launch his underdog 2004 U.S. Senate run, a slight upgrade to a small room at Hotel Allegro, a Loop spot long favored by Democrats. Then the biggest stage of them all, Grant Park, where he and 240,000 supporters celebrated a landslide 2008 victory that made him the nation's first black president. As Obama returns to Chicago for the final time in office, the venue is a bit smaller. Some of the same faithful who gathered at McCormick Place to mark his 2012 re-election will be there again Tuesday night as the president delivers a farewell address he's described as \"a chance to say thank-you for this amazing journey.\" Obama library: Latest stories, photos, commentary Open link What Chicago has meant to Obama is clear: It remains a part of his core, the home base where he'll build his presidential library and headquarter his foundation \u2014 even if it's not where he'll call home in his immediate post-White House days. But ask the city's political and community leaders what Obama's presidency has meant to Chicago, and the perspectives are as diverse as the city's 77 neighborhoods. Top aides who worked with him in the West Wing point to key projects Obama's administration awarded to Chicago, from a new runway at O'Hare and improvements to CTA lines to an expanded Riverwalk and a new high-tech digital manufacturing hub. They stress that Obama's signature Affordable Care Act has provided insurance to hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans who wouldn't have it otherwise. And they give the president credit for restoring a cratering national economy and saving an American auto industry rooted in the Midwest, moves that helped lead Chicago out of its recession. These Obama allies also acknowledge Obama didn't achieve everything he sought. A national infrastructure program that could have meant more big projects and jobs for Chicagoans eluded him. So, too, did securing tougher gun control measures \u2014 an issue that remains prominent as the city's homicides and shootings have surged. I'm sure there are many areas in which he would have liked to have done more, and there are many areas in which if he had some cooperation, he could have done more. \u2014 David Axelrod His backers argue those type of achievements were unattainable in large part because of the challenges posed by the Great Recession at the outset of his presidency and Republican control of Congress in Obama's final six years that made it difficult for him to win legislative victories in the face of constant obstruction on Capitol Hill. \"I'm sure there are many areas in which he would have liked to have done more, and there are many areas in which if he had some cooperation, he could have done more,\" said David Axelrod , Obama's longtime political strategist who served as a White House senior adviser. \"But the disappointments don't go away even as you take satisfaction in your accomplishments. You have to accept that you're there for a short period of time in the big scheme of things, and you do as much as you can and then spend the rest of your life trying to make contributions in other ways.\" To some Chicago community organizers and activists \u2014 the very role in which Obama sowed his own political seeds \u2014 the president's track record is more mixed. They laud the president and First Lady Michelle Obama for setting an example as role models for young African-Americans, but lament that Obama didn't do more to tip the scales of inequality they see in city schools that lack proper resources and in Chicago neighborhoods void of economic opportunity. \"I think Barack Obama has ignored the black community for eight years, and now he's coming to take a bow in Chicago while our neighborhoods are suffering from disinvestment and soaring unemployment,\" said Ja'Mal Green, who rose to Chicago prominence among a group of young activists who decried police misconduct following the release of the Laquan McDonald police shooting video. \"We are seeing young black men getting gunned down at a horrific rate,\" Green said, \"and he has shown no willingness to seriously address these issues.\" President Barack Obama will give his farewell address Jan. 10 at McCormick Place. Since the president's inauguration in 2009, he has made it back home to Chicago 28 times. The vast majority of those visits were for campaign events and fundraisers, but he also has given a handful of speeches on... (Nausheen Husain and Jonathon Berlin) For his part, Obama has sought to reconnect with Chicago ahead of his farewell speech. On Thursday, he sat for a rare round of short White House interviews with reporters from the city's five major TV stations. The White House declined multiple Chicago Tribune requests for an interview with the president. In his Saturday radio address, Obama explained why he picked the city for his speech. \"I chose Chicago not only because it's my hometown \u2014 where I met my wife and we started a family \u2014 but also because it's really where my career in public service began,\" he said. Projects that 'stand the test of time' Ask Rahm Emanuel what Obama's presidency has meant for Chicago, and the mayor immediately launches into a list of projects that have received federal funding \u2014 most of them on his watch. But funding first started to flow to Chicago in the early months of Obama's presidency when Emanuel still was working as the president's first chief of staff. With the economy plummeting, Obama and the Democratic majority in Congress pushed through an $840 billion stimulus program. Illinois received nearly $12 billion in grants, contracts and loans for projects ranging from new roads and repaved runways to research grants and faster rail lines. That ranked the state fourth nationwide in overall funding, but 22nd when measured per capita, at $921 per citizen. Chicago received 76 stimulus awards worth $513 million, in the form of money for neighborhood stabilization, homelessness prevention, airport paving, resurfacing major arterial roads and rebuilding Congress Parkway in the Loop. Other state transportation projects funded by the stimulus benefited the city, such as the $126 million Englewood flyover that separated two major railroad crossings on the South Side. Transportation money also flowed: an additional $155 million for a new O'Hare runway that opened in 2013, $345 million for a sixth east-west O'Hare runway and new taxiways. The CTA got several grants, including $47 million for Blue Line work, $20 million to expand the 95th Street Red Line station and a commitment for $1.1 billion to revamp the Red and Purple lines between North and Devon avenues. The lakefront and riverfront also were helped. Emanuel secured a $98.6 million federal loan to expand the Riverwalk from State to Lake streets, while Chicago benefited from a $2.2 billion Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, an effort to restore wetlands and clean up pollution. \"If you think about it, these are all major economic and culture investments that will stand the test of time,\" Emanuel said. \"Those are things that have, and will, going forward, drive Chicago's economic and cultural growth and keep the city a world-class city.\" Chicago also was awarded two other competitive grants from the Obama administration, including $70 million in federal money to build a public-private digital manufacturing institute on Goose Island, beating out the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and aerospace hub Huntsville, Ala., among other competitors. White House \u00a0and positions... Barack Obama\u00a0was elected America's first black president promising hope and change \u2014 but he inherited an economy at risk of collapse and a military fighting two wars abroad. So the 47-year-old president-elect turned to a deep bench of trusted Chicagoans to fill top jobs at the\u00a0 White House \u00a0and positions... (Katherine Skiba) Argonne National Laboratory in suburban Lemont won a $120 million grant from the Department of Energy to create a so-called Energy Innovation Hub to advance battery technology through a partnership with researchers at the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, University of Illinois at Chicago , University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Michigan. Emanuel lobbied heavily for some of the projects, making nearly 50 trips to Washington in his five-plus years as mayor. His official calendars showed him meeting with Defense officials before the digital manufacturing grant was awarded and several meetings with transportation officials in the months running up to grant announcements. The mayor said Chicago projects had to meet a higher standard because the Obama administration did not want any deals for the president's hometown to \"come under the political microscope.\" \"It's a double-edged sword. One side is you're his first chief of staff, helped assemble the administration and you're also a former member of Congress and know that process, so it's helpful,\" said Emanuel, who represented a North Side district before leaving that post to work for Obama. \"On the other hand, the projects had to be better than good, they had to be great. It was getting double scrutiny, because it couldn't be a gift.\" William Daley , the son of one former Chicago mayor and the brother of another, said he saw firsthand the aversion in the Obama White House toward any perceived favoritism for Chicago. That was particularly true, he said, when Chicago did not win any of the initial education grants under Obama's Race to the Top program, even as former Chicago Public Schools CEO Arne Duncan was serving as secretary of education. \"The president was rightfully very sensitive to an allegation that somehow they were rigging the system to help Chicago,\" said Daley , who served as Obama's second chief of staff. \"A lot of people in Chicago were ticked off because they didn't make the cut. There was an expectation by a lot of the press that Chicago was going to get a ton of (education) money, because Obama was from there and Emanuel was mayor ... but that wasn't the case.\" Chicagoans tell their stories about important policy decisions as well as personal connections with the Obamas. Obama, though, did tap plenty of Chicagoans to take top positions in the administration. In addition to Emanuel and Daley as chiefs of staff, Axelrod as a senior adviser and Duncan as education secretary, Valerie Jarrett served as a top Obama confidant and adviser for all eight years and billionaire businesswoman Penny Pritzker was tapped for commerce secretary. Scores of other Chicagoans filled key advisory and staff positions and could emerge as key political players down the line, Obama's top advisers agreed. Emanuel often has said he didn't want to take the chief of staff job, content with his family settled in Chicago and a leadership role in Congress. But, the future mayor said, he abided by his grandfather's rule of only offering one of two answers to a request by the president, \"yes\" or \"yes, sir.\" The high-profile job did position Emanuel to move back to Chicago and run for mayor once Richard M. Daley announced his retirement. Asked if it's unlikely he would have become mayor otherwise, Emanuel laughs. \"That's a hypothetical that neither you or I can answer, OK?\" Emanuel said in an interview last week. \"I do know this: It helped.\" 'Sick of Barack Obama the politician' Some community activists and organizers, however, aren't as quick to paint a rosy picture of Obama's Chicago legacy. Jitu Brown, a longtime community organizer who helped lead a hunger strike to save Dyett High School in the Washington Park neighborhood after Emanuel tried to close it, termed Obama's impact on Chicago as \"complicated.\" Brown said he used to take Chicago students to visit then-state Sen. Obama in Springfield, and said his legacy as a role model for young people in the city can't be overstated. And he applauded Obama's successes on the economy and health care reform, saying working-class and poor Chicagoans have better lives because the president chose to emphasize those initiatives. But Brown termed the Obama administration's reliance on competition among states for federal education grants and the pro-charter school ethos exemplified by Duncan's tenure as education secretary \"a major disappointment, and a missed opportunity.\" I hear about people crying in Grant Park when he won in 2008, and now eight years later those same people are saying \"What happened?\" \u2014 Ja'Mal Green, Chicago activist Brown said many urban education activists hoped Obama's background in Chicago would lead to a re-examination of ways to fund local schools so children in all parts of the city would be able to get a good education near their homes. \"They aren't addressing the fact a child in a school at Diversey and Ashland is learning Mandarin and enjoying a strong arts program and a host of after-school activities, while at 45th and King Drive you have schools with 52 kindergartners in a classroom,\" Brown said. \"That's an ugliness I think the Obama administration failed miserably on.\" Green, the young activist who has been vocal on Chicago police misconduct, was unsparing in his assessment of Obama's disappointments. He said the president hasn't done enough to spur jobs in black neighborhoods, confront unjustified killings by police or work to prioritize solutions to the city's violent crime woes. \"I'm sick of Barack Obama the politician. We need somebody who's actually going to care about the issues,\" Green said. \"Young people and black people are the reason he's in office, and I think he's lost a lot of that support. I hear about people crying in Grant Park when he won in 2008, and now eight years later those same people are saying 'What happened?'\" Green gave Obama credit for efforts to pardon people in prison for drug crimes, but said the president has done too little to respond to the local and national outcry over police shootings. \"How can you be a black president coming from Chicago and not speak out at this time?\" he asked. \"Black Lives Matter started during your administration. Where's your voice on this?\" Amid concerns over police-neighborhood relations as an outgrowth of police-related shootings across the nation, Obama spoke to the International Association of Chiefs of Police at McCormick Place in October 2015. He sought to strike a balance between concerns of overaggressive policing and urging law enforcement to support tougher gun-control laws. But community organizer Amisha Patel said Obama too often tried to walk a fine line on such issues. \"I think the president was afraid to be clear on an urban agenda. I don't think he thought he had room to move on that, and so you get a really hands-off approach, these half-solutions,\" Patel said. \"There was tremendous pressure on Obama, being the first black president of this country, and I think he was focused on being seen as the president for everybody in the country, and so he moved away from urban issues.\" Patel applauded Obama's success with Obamacare and noted the great pride many Chicagoans feel in him, but said the high expectations many locals had when Obama took office because of his background and understanding of city problems were met with disappointment. \"When he campaigned in 2008, he campaigned as a community organizer, but he didn't govern as one,\" she said. \"I think that's a missed opportunity.\" ",

    "text": "Federal prosecutors file charges against Santiago, he could face the death penalty Published               January 07, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 The suspected killer in the Ft. Lauderdale rampage, 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, was charged on Saturday with performing an act of violence at an airport, which could earn him the death penalty if he is convicted. Federal prosecutors filed the charges, which include violations related to firearms, in Broward County, Florida. Earlier, the FBI announced that Santiago apparently traveled to the airport for the purpose of carrying out the bloody rampage. Terrorism may have been a \"potential motivation\" for the attack on Friday that killed five people,\u00a0Special Agent in Charge\u00a0George Piro said during a news conference, adding that officials would release specific charges later Saturday. Later in the afternoon, police in Alaska said they had returned a handgun to the Florida airport shooting suspect which was temporarily taken from him when he underwent a mental evaluation late last year, according to a Reuters report. Anchorage Police Chief Christopher Tolley said it was not immediately clear if it was the same gun used in Friday's deadly rampage. Officials told a news conference the gun was returned to the suspect because the Iraq war veteran had not committed a crime. Why the gunman may have chosen South Florida was unclear. He had no clear connection to the state aside from relatives in the Naples area, a two-hour drive away, the\u00a0 Sun Sentinel reported . VIDEO: SEN. RUBIO REACTS TO AIRPORT SHOOTING\u00a0 The suspected shooter had a history of mental health problems -- some of which followed his military service in Iraq -- and was receiving psychological treatment at his home in Alaska, his relatives said. FBI investigators questioned Santiago for hours. Piro said investigators were scouring the 26-year-old suspect's social media footprint and looking into where he'd traveled before. Santiago was not on any no-fly list, according to the FBI. He allegedly carried out the attack with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, Piro added. FT. LAUDERDALE SHOOTING SUSPECT SAID HE WAS FORCED TO WATCH ISIS VIDEOS Broward County Sheriff\u00a0Scott\u00a0Israel said six people were wounded in the attack -- not eight, as officials had said Friday. Three were in the intensive care unit and three were in good condition, Israel told reporters. \"Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good,\" Santiago's uncle, Hernan Rivera,\u00a0 told The Record newspaper . Santiago deployed in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion, according to Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen. In recent years, Santiago -- a new dad, family said -- had been living in Anchorage, Alaska, his brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press from Puerto Rico. Bryan Santiago said his brother's girlfriend had recently called the family to alert them to his treatment. In November, Esteban told FBI agents in Alaska that the government was controlling his mind and was forcing him to watch Islamic State group videos, a law enforcement official said. The official was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation by name and spoke Friday on condition of anonymity. The FBI agents notified the police after the interview with Esteban Santiago, who took him in for a mental health evaluation. Bryan Santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues. \"We have not talked for the past three weeks,\" Bryan Santiago said. \"That's a bit unusual ... I'm in shock. He was a serious person ... He was a normal person.\" Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in the southern coastal town of Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007. Former neighbor Ursula Candelario recalled seeing Esteban Santiago grow up and said people used to salute him after he joined the Guard. \"He was very peaceful, very educated, very serious,\" she said. \"We're in shock. I couldn't believe it,\" said Candelario. While in Iraq, Santiago cleared roads of improvised explosive devices and at least two members of his company were killed, spokesman Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead told The New York Times. He was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Since returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Anchorage, Olmstead told the AP. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for \"unsatisfactory performance,\" said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, a spokeswoman. His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said. She would not elaborate on his discharge, but the Pentagon said he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged. Still, he'd had some successes during his military career, being awarded a number of medals and commendations including the Iraq Campaign Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. His uncle and aunt in New Jersey were trying to make sense of what they were hearing about Santiago after his arrest at the Fort Lauderdale airport. \u00a0FBI agents arrived at their house to question them, and reporters swarmed around. Maria Ruiz told The Record that her nephew had recently become a father to a son and was struggling. \"It was like he lost his mind,\" she said in Spanish of his return from Iraq. \"He said he saw things.\" Santiago was flying from Anchorage on a Delta flight and had checked only one piece of luggage, which contained the gun. Santiago was charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend's Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents. A month later municipal prosecutors said he violated the conditions of his release when officers found him at her home during a routine check. He told police he had lived there since he was released from custody the previous month. His Anchorage attorney, Max Holmquist, declined to discuss his client. Law enforcement officers were at the girlfriend's home Friday afternoon, and officers guarding the property outside told a reporter who approached the home to step away. Senator-elect Nelson Cruz, who knew the family and represents the town where they live in Puerto Rico, said he had been talking regularly with Bryan Santiago since the shooting. \"They're very humble and very Christian people,\" Cruz said of Esteban Santiago's brother and mother. \"They want to tell the families of the victims that they're extremely saddened and extremely upset by what happened.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "text": "Her co-worker lost his thumb in a beef jerky plant accident. She lost her job for helping him. Ben GuarinoThe Washington Post One early Monday in July 2014, a band saw blade at a West Virginia beef jerky plant lopped off a man's thumb. Upon hearing a cry of pain, and witnessing the blood that ran down her co-worker's hand and arm, a food processing employee named Michele Butler-Savage rushed to help. Butler-Savage attempted to stanch the wound with paper towels and cold water. Using her cellphone, she began to dial for emergency medical aid. The call to 911 did not go through. According to a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department on Thursday, Butler-Savage's boss, John M. Bachman, ordered her to hang up the phone. Bachman collected the thumb, which moments before had been part of a man named Chris Crane, and told the shift supervisor to drive Crane to an emergency care clinic. The emergency room transferred Crane to a hospital, where surgeons were unable to reattach the digit. At the scene of the accident, where, per the lawsuit, \"Crane's blood had spurted all over the floor and wall,\" Butler-Savage alleged that Bachman did little in the way of cleaning afterward. She contacted a USDA inspector, explaining her sanitation concerns and that her boss denied her call to an ambulance. More than an appendage would be lost in the accident. Two days later, Butler-Savage was fired from her 5-month-old job at Lone Star Western Beef. Bachman owns Lone Star Western Beef, a jerky company with the slogan, \"This ain't no wimpy city slicker beef jerky.\" Crane lost his thumb at the Lone Star plant that was located in Fairmont, W.Va.; the beef jerky facility moved to Pennsylvania in 2015. Bachman told Butler-Savage, according to the lawsuit, that she was fired because \"production was slow,\" though he also complained that \"there were too many government rules to follow\" and \"the government always had a hand in his business.\" The Labor Department filed a lawsuit against Lone Star on Thursday in federal court in the Northern District of West Virginia. Butler-Savage's actions showed \"basic human decency,\" said Occupational Safety and Health Administration Philadelphia Administrator Richard Mendelson in a Labor Department news release. An OSHA investigation, according to the release, found that the jerky company violated the law when Bachman fired her for her aborted attempt to call 911. \"No worker should have to fear retaliation from their employer for calling 911 in an emergency, or taking other action to report a workplace safety or health incident,\" Mendelson said. The suit seeks punitive damages and lost wages arising from Butler-Savage's termination. Lone Star Western Beef did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post sent early Friday. The Associated Press was also unable to reach Bachman at the company's phone number. ",

    "text": "How Russia Used Trolls, Cyberattacks and Propaganda to Try to Influence Election By Meghan Keneally Jan 6, 2017, 11:05 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Obama Weighs In on Intelligence Report 0 Shares Email A declassified report on Russian hacking activity pertaining to the recent U.S. presidential election details how intelligence officials believe Moscow and its supporters attempted to put their stamp on the political process. The report, which comes after an investigation ordered by President Obama, specifies that there is no indication that Russian actors directly interfered with vote counts but does indicate that there were a number of other ways that they got involved in the contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton . In March 2016, two months before Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, the report says that \"Russian Government-linked actors began openly supporting President-elect Trump's candidacy in media aimed at English-speaking audiences.\" Trump has repeatedly called into question U.S. intelligence assessments about Russian interference in the election, specifically hacking, despite several statements from those agencies indicating they believed that to be the case. He even went so far as to suggest that intelligence agencies were delaying a briefing with him until today because they were building their case. The \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 After being briefed today, Trump maintained that \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,\" according to a statement. Putin 'Ordered' Campaign to Influence US Presidential Election, Intelligence Community Says The report details an elaborate effort by the Russian government, at the direction of its president Vladimir Putin , to discredit and denigrate Hillary Clinton while trying to cast Donald Trump in a favorable light including cyberattacks as well as propaganda. The report specifically names Dmitriy Kiselev -- who it calls \"Putin's chief propagandist\" -- saying that he used his weekly newsmagazine program \"to cast President-elect Trump as an outsider victimized by a corrupt political establishment and faulty democratic election process.\" A number of videos published on the website of RT, which the report calls \"the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet,\" had headlines specifically targeting Clinton, with one connecting Clinton to ISIS money and another purporting that the Clintons were the biggest recipients of Clinton Foundation money: n, \u201cHow 100% of the Clintons\u2019 \u2018Charity\u2019 Went to\u2026Themselves.\u201d Several of those stories received more than 9 million views on social media platforms, the report states, and one single story had more than 2.2 million views. The report states that the news coverage that RT dedicated to Hillary Clinton was \"consistently negative and focused on her leaked emails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health , and ties to Islamic extremism.\" The head of RT, Margarita Simonyan, tweeted \"they're joking, right?\" in Russian Friday, mocking the intelligence report. Another specific tool that intelligence officials believe was used by the Russians were internet \"trolls\" who \"amplified stories on scandals about Secretary Clinton and the role of Wikileaks in the election campaign.\" The trolls were deemed \"professionals\" in the report, and were \"previously devoted to supporting Russian actions in Ukraine.\" The work of those trolls appear to be among some of the earliest actions that were taken by Russian forces in support of Trump, as the report states that the trolls \"started to advocate for President-elect Trump as early as December 2015.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "President Obama speaks to Caterpillar employees in East Peoria, Ill., in February 2009 about the then-struggling economy. Charles Dharapak/AP hide caption toggle caption Charles Dharapak/AP President Obama speaks to Caterpillar employees in East Peoria, Ill., in February 2009 about the then-struggling economy. Charles Dharapak/AP The final chapter of the Obama economy drew that much closer to its end on Friday, with the final jobs report of the 44th president's time in office. That report showed the 75th straight month of job growth, with employers adding 156,000 jobs. Solid, but nothing flashy. In that way, it was emblematic of how the job market has generally fared since the worst of the Great Recession's aftermath: chugging along, slowly but surely recovering. With the final Obama administration jobs day in the books, it's a good time to look at how American workers have fared. Donald Trump will inherit a job market that is vastly rehabilitated from devastating lows just a few years ago. However, it has also undergone profound changes that have scarred many American workers. Unemployment: How low can it go? As Obama prepares to leave office, the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, less than half of the peak it reached in October 2009. That decline is the result of a prolonged period of job growth. The administration has grown fond of showing off its prolonged run of job growth every month. Longest streak of total job growth on record \u2713 Fastest wage growth since the start of the recovery \u2713 https://t.co/uo6Mz0WggU #JobsReport pic.twitter.com/DUjA4cmPWg \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 6, 2017 For some perspective, here's how big that job growth was: Obama averaged 109,000 jobs per month. That's far better than either President Bush experienced, but it's well below the 242,000 that Bill Clinton presided over in the roaring 1990s. For Reagan, it was 166,000. Article continues after sponsorship Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Of course, President Obama came into office as the economy was plunging into a recession (a plunge that also drags down George W. Bush's number). But even if you average out Obama's 75 straight months of job growth, you get 199,000 jobs per month, still shy of Clinton's economy. In other words, the Obama recovery has been moderate, but remarkably steady. The question is how long that steady climb can continue uninterrupted. The unemployment rate is already near a nine-year low, as Steven Russolillo at the Wall Street Journal pointed out this week, and there is some question among economists how low it can go. Wages finally climbing Having a job is one thing. Having a job that pays well is another. And slowly through Obama's tenure, those wages have inched upward. In fact, wages were one bright spot of Friday's jobs report. Average hourly wages were up by 2.9 percent in December. After several years of hovering around 2 percent, that's welcome growth. Aside from meaning more money in workers' pockets, wage growth serves as yet another sign of a tightening labor market, signaling that employers are willing to pay more to attract workers. Rising wages may inspire the Federal Reserve to take its foot further off the gas pedal in the coming months (that is, allow interest rates to rise) \u2014 a reminder that the economy isn't exactly under the president's control. (More on this later.) Labor force participation is low, but what does it mean? This one became a flashpoint in the presidential election, with Trump at times pointing out how much the labor force shrank under Obama. The main measure of this is the labor force participation rate \u2014 that is, the percentage of people who are either working or looking for work (that is, who are in the labor force). That figure was at 65.7 percent in January 2009, at the start of Obama's presidency, and today is at 62.7 percent \u2014 a steep drop. And today, the figure is well below its 2000 high of 67.3 percent. But it's not clear how bad or how benign that change is. Many Americans are out of the labor force and entirely happy about it. Quitting work to retire, for example, is a totally nonalarming reason to leave the labor force. But then, there may be many people who, facing a tough job market, have given up looking for work. That's not good, and it also happened for many Americans both during and after the recession. In the aftermath of the recession, economists have tried to figure out exactly how many people are voluntarily versus involuntarily out of the labor force. As of 2014 , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that half the decline in the participation rate at that time had come from \"long-term trends\" like aging \u2014 as baby boomers age, that means a large chunk of the population will naturally retire. But that left half of the decline a result of economic weakness and a slow recovery, in the CBO's estimation. Should the participation rate hold steady or creep upward during a Trump presidency, that could keep the unemployment rate from dropping, as only Americans who are looking for work are counted as \"unemployed.\" That would be one of those cases where a slightly higher unemployment rate could be a good thing. Improvement for part-time workers Full-time job growth over the course of the Obama presidency has far outstripped part-time job growth, as FiveThirtyEight's Ben Casselman has pointed out. Part-time jobs ticked up in November, but overall, employment growth in recovery has been almost all full-time. pic.twitter.com/m1MrB1ZA3e \u2014 Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) December 2, 2016 Of course, some of those people working part time want to be working part time, and some don't. Another bright spot here is that the share of those workers who are involuntarily part time has fallen off. However, that figure is still a fair bit higher than it was prior to the recession (and that level was itself, in turn, higher than it was before the prior recession). That's one place where there could still be some improvement \u2014 there are still about 1 million more of those involuntary part-time workers than there were prior to the recession. An economy more about doing than making Politicians of both parties love to talk about manufacturing. Obama pushed manufacturing initiatives throughout his presidency, and Trump built much of his economic message during the campaign around singing the praises of America's manufacturers. But when it comes to employment, the goods-producing share of the economy has continued to fall. Throughout the past few decades, the share of Americans who make things \u2014 people in manufacturing, mining, logging and construction \u2014 has fallen off, and that trend continued during the recent recession, finally flattening out toward the end. We present this chart over a longer time frame, which makes it a little bit of a cheat \u2014 this isn't exactly a measure of Obama's \"record on jobs.\" Nor is it necessarily a measure of economic weakness; in fact, manufacturing has, thanks to technological advances, maintained strong output while shedding workers . It's a reminder that all the usual macroeconomic indicators (unemployment, wages, labor force participation, GDP) can quantify a lot of things in the economy, but you have to dig in to learn about the quality of that economy \u2014 what exactly is going on behind those numbers. This decline in goods-producing jobs doesn't signal that the economy is getting worse or better \u2014 it's just changing, in this case to become more focused on providing services , instead of goods. All of this is to say that Trump inherits a job market that is humming along comfortably, given how poor of shape it was in only recently. But it's also an economy that has sharply moved away from manufacturing and other goods-producing industries \u2014 the very ones he pushed the most in the election. That change has hurt plenty of Americans, despite the job market's improvement. Trump has tried to claim credit for several hundred goods-producing jobs here and there (credit that he doesn't always deserve, as the Washington Post's Philip Bump has reported ), but bringing manufacturing employment back in a sizable way seems like a tall order for any president. Furthermore, alternative work \u2014 like driving an Uber or Lyft \u2014 continues to grow quickly as a share of the economy. That change could eventually require policy attention, as more workers take jobs that don't come with benefits. But there's another big caveat here. Presidents get lots of credit and blame for the economy's performance, despite the fact that they don't really have firm control over that performance. (If they did, why would recessions ever happen?) Yes, a president can push an economic agenda and in some cases push particular policies that end up having a sizable impact on the economy (see: the 2009 stimulus package, which undeniably had a positive impact). But they also need Congress to enact those policies. Not only that, but the Federal Reserve has its own set of controls \u2014 a set to which the president does not have access, despite some conspiracies of politically motivated Fed scale-tipping. So, like Obama, whatever happens to the economy under Trump, he may not deserve whatever credit he may claim (and the same goes for whatever blame is thrown his way). ",

That gives Latin America\u2019s biggest country, population 206 million, more cows than people. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While Brazil\u2019s economy is mired in a long slump , agribusiness has remained largely resilient during the crisis. The expansion of a rodeo circuit in Brazil, with hundreds of flashy competitions held across the vast interior each year, points to the importance of ranching as a pillar of the economy. That\u2019s where Mr. Lima comes in as an unofficial spokesman for Brazil\u2019s farm states. While unknown to many residents of coastal cities in Brazil, he has won fame in the hinterland as a rodeo announcer with an ostentatious style that might shock some counterparts in the United States, and for his vocal embrace of socially conservative positions in a country shifting to the right . Photo Mr. Lima, a country singer and bull riding announcer, in an animated chat at a barbecue house in Goi\u00e2nia. Credit Dado Galdieri for The New York Times In a meandering interview over a lunch of draft beer and copious amounts of beef, Mr. Lima expressed his views on a wide variety of issues, including religion (he calls himself as a staunch Roman Catholic who also frequents an evangelical church), the role of women in society (his views appear to be reflected in a country music video he made in which he boasts about paying for a homemaker\u2019s plastic surgery) and the environment. \u201cDon\u2019t get me started on the Amazon,\u201d Mr. Lima said, referring to the vast river basin where, the authorities say, the expansion of Brazil\u2019s ranching frontier has illegally destroyed large tracts of the rain forest. \u201cI\u2019ve flown over the Amazon in a small plane, and all I saw for hours was trees. Trust me, we can deforest a lot more if we have to.\u201d Mr. Lima\u2019s readiness to voice publicly what many Brazilians say in private reflects, perhaps, a yearning for the spotlight. As he roams the backlands rodeo circuit in his Mitsubishi Titan pickup, the competitions where Mr. Lima works are often as much about him as they are about bull-riding buckaroos. At a rodeo here in Goi\u00e2nia on a recent Friday night, scantily clad female dancers warmed up the arena before Mr. Lima burst onto the scene around midnight, his arrival heralded by fireworks, a nightclub smoke machine, cannons discharging confetti into the air and a dance involving a good deal of strutting by Mr. Lima himself. After singing Brazil\u2019s national anthem, he led competitors in a lengthy prayer before getting on with the event. He often cracks jokes, exudes pride in Brazil\u2019s ranching culture and bursts into song while describing the technical aspects of the cowpokes competing for prize money. \u201cI love the United States and recognize how much we owe to the rodeo scene up there, but the folks in Brazil expect a little more from their rodeo announcers,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat am I, essentially? A storyteller.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Lima got into radio announcing after studying three things: law, journalism and how to be a clown. He said it was during his time at clown school in Rio, when he was trying to find a way into show business, \u201cthat I learned the valuable lesson of laughing at my own failures.\u201d A self-described \u201cbastard son of a rancher,\u201d Mr. Lima was raised by his mother, a shopkeeper, in Barretos, a city in S\u00e3o Paulo State that has long been an epicenter of the Brazilian rodeo scene. Mr. Lima travels extensively throughout the year to various farming regions, but still lives in Barretos with his wife and son. Continue reading the main story Photo It was bull versus rider in Goi\u00e2nia last month, with Mr. Lima offering commentary from in front of the big TV screen. Credit Dado Galdieri for The New York Times To the surprise of some of his fans, he was not always Cuiabanno Lima. His given name was Andraus Ara\u00fajo de Lima; Andraus was also the name of a S\u00e3o Paulo skyscraper that caught fire in 1972, a tragedy in which people trying to escape the flames were filmed leaping to their death from upper floors. \u201cObviously, I needed a new name, something that spoke to the greatness of the interior of Brazil,\u201d he said about his stage name. Cuiabanno refers to people from Cuiab\u00e1, the frontier capital of Mato Grosso, a western state with burgeoning farming enterprises. In a country where animal-rights activists have grown more vocal in recent years, not everyone appreciates Mr. Lima\u2019s exaltation of Brazil\u2019s agribusiness prowess. \u201cCuibanno is nothing more than an amusing court jester in a rodeo scene dominated by wealthy ranchers and corporate sponsors,\u201d said Leandro Ferro, president of I Hate Rodeo, a nonprofit group in S\u00e3o Paulo seeking to raise awareness about claims of animal cruelty at Brazil\u2019s rodeos. Mr. Lima chafes at such criticism, contending that his critics are unrealistic about the significance of agriculture and ranching in contemporary society. \u201cNot everyone can go organic, eating leaves in expensive pretty packages,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world needs animal protein, and Brazil supplies it.\u201d As for rodeos, Mr. Lima said he was pleased that they were growing into a big business with corporate backers. He noted with pride that Brazilian \u201ccaub\u00f3is\u201d had grown so skilled in some competitions, like professional bull riding, that they ranked among the top money earners in the United States. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite championing such feats, along with his own rising prominence, Mr. Lima contends that elites in cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio opt to ignore the signs around them that Brazil\u2019s ranching culture, with its conservative values, is gaining prominence. In Brazilian politics, for instance, a powerful bloc representing large landowners and large-scale agricultural interests exerts considerable sway in Congress. And a subgenre of Brazilian country music called \u201csertanejo universit\u00e1rio,\u201d tapping the aspirations of the college-educated middle class, has surged in popularity. \u201cWe produce the country\u2019s wealth and increasingly the culture that people consume, but the interior of Brazil remains neglected,\u201d Mr. Lima said. \u201cSomething in this equation has got to give.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2017, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Voice of Rodeo  Rides Brazil\u2019s Shift to the Right.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Paul Kane January 7 at 2:09 PM Follow @pkcapitol Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) should have been a tough sell in the U.S. Senate. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general voted to impeach then-President Clinton, opposed President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees and led the opposition to a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill. He was also denied a federal judgeship 30 years ago \u2014 by the U.S. Senate \u2014 amid allegations that as U.S. attorney he had improperly prosecuted black voting-rights activists and used racially intemperate language. But here\u2019s something else to know about Sessions: He is one of the more well-liked members of the Senate, a place that still retains elements of one of the world\u2019s most exclusive clubs. He is genial, respectful and patient \u2014 to both colleagues and staff. And that has given fellow Republicans and even some Democrats reason not to scrutinize the more unsavory allegations of his political history. Take Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine who, under other circumstances, might be a target for Democrats to peel off in hopes of defeating Sessions\u2019 nomination. Instead, she\u2019s his lead spokeswoman. Sen. Jeff Session ( R-Ala.), President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, speaks during a post-election Trump rally in Mobile, Ala., on Dec. 17. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Sessions and Collins may both be Republicans, but otherwise they could not be more different. He is a Methodist who grew up in a small town 100 miles from Alabama\u2019s Gulf Coast. She was raised Catholic in tiny Caribou, Maine, less than 20 miles from the Canadian border. He speaks in a lilting twang; she with New England deliberativeness. While Sessions was building a voting record in the Senate as a rock-ribbed conservative, Collins has most often been on the opposite side \u2014 the leading moderate of her generation who refused to vote for Trump and patterned her career after fellow Mainer Margaret Chase Smith, who made national headlines in the early 1950s by standing up to Joe McCarthy (and was the first woman to serve in both the House and the Senate). On Tuesday, Collins will introduce Sessions to the Senate Judiciary Committee with a full-throated endorsement for his nomination as attorney general. \u201cHe\u2019s a decent individual with a strong commitment to the rule of law. He\u2019s a leader of integrity,\u201d Collins said in an interview, dismissing attacks from liberal activists about his conservative views and his actions as a young, southern prosecutor. \u201cI think the attacks against him are not well-founded and are unfair.\u201d Collins\u2019s high-profile endorsement signals the uphill fight Sessions\u2019s opponents face in trying to deny his bid to become the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer with the sort of broadside attacks that have become common in confirmation hearings. Despite holding some of the most conservative positions in the Senate, Sessions is a heavy favorite to win confirmation. \u201cI genuinely like him,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Coons still might vote against Session because of the \u201cstark differences\u201d between the two on policy, but they are friends. This has frustrated the liberal coalition of civil rights groups leading the opposition. In 1986 this same coalition successfully swayed the committee to reject Sessions for a federal judgeship. Rather than slink into retirement, Sessions won a Senate seat in 1996 and has served ever since on the Judiciary Committee, whose members are now tasked with voting on his fitness for office. \u201cYou should be sitting in that room prepared to learn about this person, who you may have seen running next to you on the treadmill in the Senate gym, who you have may have had lunch with, whose family you may even know, but whose record as it relates to the critical issue of civil rights you might not know,\u201d Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., said Friday during a conference call with coalition members. Democrats aren\u2019t about to give Sessions a free pass. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the former committee chairman, wants to question him on his views on religious freedom based on a committee vote Sessions cast a few years ago. Coons went home for the weekend with a 300-page briefing book on Sessions\u2019 record, ranging from civil liberties to his personal financial investments. Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, will be watching questions about the Bush administration\u2019s use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which some viewed as torture of terrorists. But most senators tend to view Sessions in the same way Collins does \u2014 as a friendly man who never broke his word to them. Many have prayed with him and traveled with him on official overseas trips. Almost no one wants to review the original allegations against him during his 1986 nomination; for the most part, they don\u2019t believe that he is the racist that some have painted \u2014 at least not anymore. [ Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general is shadowed by race and history ] \u201cI don\u2019t know the dynamics of what happened then, but I can speak to Jeff\u2019s character in the 20 years that I\u2019ve known him,\u201d Collins said. The dynamic harks back to that surrounding the late Democratic senator Edward M. Kennedy, whose early career was defined and grievously wounded by the scandal resulting from a car accident on Chappaquiddick Island off the coast of Massachusetts in 1969. Kennedy, who was driving, swam free and left the scene; his 28-year-old female companion died inside the car. Kennedy\u2019s Senate colleagues found plenty of fodder in his liberal record to use against him during debates, but they never yelled, \u201cChappaquiddick!\u201d in floor debates or committee rooms. They liked Kennedy; they trusted him. His political opponents chose to fight him on the merits of the moment, not on his long-ago past. One senator who has wanted to focus more on Sessions\u2019s past on race is Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the chamber\u2019s only black Republican. \u201cI think judging a person on 30-year-old history is questionable. Eliminating or exempting 30-year-old history is probably not wise as well,\u201d Scott said. \u201cSo, making sure that you understand what it actually was and who he is, has been an important part of what I\u2019ve tried to do.\u201d Scott hosted Sessions in mid-December in North Charleston with local activists who peppered him with questions about federal prosecution of a police officer who shot a black man in the back and killed him. \u201cThe attorney general\u2019s position has more impact on communities of color than perhaps any other nominee,\u201d Scott said, adding that he was still considering the nomination. By and large, most senators want to focus on other topics. And there\u2019s plenty there to discuss, from how he would handle the deportation of illegal immigrants already in the United States to allegations that in 1995, while serving as state attorney general, he supported the use of chain gangs for prisoner work. Coons suggested that Sessions had so many staunchly conservative positions in \u201cthe recent past\u201d that there was little need to relitigate the 1980s. He spent an hour with Sessions Thursday talking about legal philosophy. Coons and Sessions have spent the last six years talking at the Senate\u2019s weekly Bible study and working out together in the gym. Collins and Sessions have had plenty of debates \u2014 in public, in closed caucus meetings and at the many dinners of the Senate class of 1996. They were almost always on opposing sides, but she learned to trust his consistency. Collins announced back in August that she would not vote for Trump. But when Sessions asked her to introduce him Tuesday \u2014 usually the task of a home-state colleague \u2014 Collins happily accepted the role for a friend of 20 years. \u201cHe\u2019s the same person,\u201d she said.

Here's a look at other recent attacks that resulted in deaths at U.S. airports: \u2014 Nov. 16, 2016: A Southwest Airlines worker was shot and killed near an employee parking lot at Oklahoma City's airport. Police said the man who shot him was likely retaliating after losing his own job with the airline. \u2014 March 21, 2015: A machete-wielding man attacked federal transportation security officers, slightly injuring one, at New Orleans' international airport and was shot to death. Authorities later said he also was carrying a bag loaded with Molotov cocktails. \u2014 Nov. 1, 2013: A gunman with a grudge against the Transportation Security Administration shot and killed one of the agency's screeners and wounded three other people during a rampage at Los Angeles International Airport. He was sentenced to life plus 60 years in prison for murder and other crimes. \u2014 July 4, 2002: An Egyptian national from Irvine, California, opened fire at an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, killing an airline employee and a diamond importer, and wounding four others. He was shot dead by a security guard. \u2014 May 22, 2002: A former Marine killed a San Diego woman in the ticket area of the Louis Armstrong International Airport in New Orleans with a shotgun he had concealed inside a tube container. He was later found not guilty by reason of insanity. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "AP January 7, 2017, 7:32 PM Snow pounds parts of East Coast, spares several big cities Email DURHAM, N.C. -- Snow and sleet pounded a large swath of the U.S. East Coast on Saturday, coating roads with ice and causing hundreds of crashes. Thousands of people lost power and forecasters warned of blizzard-like conditions from Virginia to parts of the Northeast.\u00a0 The West Coast is bracing for another wave of snow, ice and rain this weekend. It could bring the worst flooding in decades. John Blackstone has ... Police investigated several fatal crashes as potentially storm-related, but some of the South\u2019s biggest cities - Atlanta, Charlotte and Raleigh - appeared to avoid the worst of the storm. Authorities praised residents for learning the lessons of past storms that resulted in icy gridlock, where thousands of people were stranded along the interstates. But officials warned that bitter cold would keep roads treacherous well after the snow and sleet stopped.\u00a0 \u201cIf I tell you anything it would be stay home,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. \u201cDo not go out and drive on the roads unless you absolutely have to.\u201d\u00a0 Cooper was supposed to have been sworn in Saturday at an outdoor ceremony attended by thousands. He instead rushed through a 20-minute indoor oath-taking Friday. \u201cConsider yourselves the chosen few,\u201d Cooper jokingly told family, friends and well-wishers able to attend his swearing-in Friday.\u00a0 A pedestrian walks through the snow during a winter storm in Medford, Massachusetts, Jan. 7, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder On Saturday he said there were at least 260 traffic accidents between midnight and 6 a.m. as the winter storm blew in. Authorities say they haven\u2019t confirmed any weather-related deaths. Cooper said that even after precipitation is expected to stop later in the day, bitter cold will blow in and refreeze any melted slush on roads.\u00a0 A National Weather Service map showed the snowfall seemed to follow the Interstate 85 corridor through the state, with locations along and north of the highway receiving snow, and areas to the south getting rain and sleet. Burlington and Roxboro in central North Carolina received 8 inches or more of snow. Preliminary figures from the National Weather Service in Greer, South Carolina, showed snowfall totals reached up to 10 inches in at least seven locations, including Greensboro and High Point, Lewisville in Forsyth County, and Lenoir and Rhodhiss in Caldwell County.\u00a0 Power outages had grown to about 25,000 in North Carolina alone, according to a news release from the governor. Nearly half were in the Charlotte area and adjacent Union County, according to Duke Power.\u00a0 Roads were also treacherous. The South Carolina Highway Patrol said there was significant snow on roads in the northern part of the state and asked drivers to stay home.\u00a0 Several inches also fell in southeast Virginia, where a blizzard warning was issued for the cities along the coast. Virginia State Police said they responded to 325 crashes and 322 disabled vehicles across the state between midnight and noon on Saturday. The National Weather Service had already measured nearly 6 inches of snow at its post in Wakefield on Saturday.\u00a0 Even with snow coating Virginia Beach roads, diners and staff made it to the popular breakfast spot Citrus.\u00a0 \u201cWhen there\u2019s bad weather, people come out,\u201d manager Tara Junke said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in restaurants for 20 years in Hampton Roads and we\u2019ve never shut down for snow.\u201d\u00a0 In Tennessee, hundreds of crashes were reported starting Friday. From Atlanta to airports farther north, hundreds of flights were canceled. At least one fatality - a man whose pickup truck went off a snow-slickened Kentucky road Thursday - has been blamed on the weather. Motorist deaths in North Carolina and Maryland as the storm blew in were being investigated to see if they were caused by the weather. In Atlanta and parts of Georgia, people who were expecting a couple of inches of snow instead woke up to a thin coat of ice. The National Weather Service said a wind chill advisory for northern Georgia was to go into effect later Saturday into Sunday.  Residents should brace for bitterly cold air and strong wind.\u00a0 Traffic was barely crawling across parts of central Mississippi on Saturday morning, with 18-wheel trucks pulled over on the shoulders of icy highways in spots. Jackson\u2019s city streets were supposed to be filled with runners Saturday, but organizers canceled the annual Mississippi Blues Marathon, citing weather and travel conditions.\u00a0 Drivers struggled to make it up hills in some places, including an off-ramp from an interstate leading to two of Jackson\u2019s largest hospitals. The Mississippi Department of Transportation advised people to stay off roads, saying Friday night that it was focusing on getting stranded motorists to safety. Hours of sleet coated parts of the state Friday.\u00a0 It was unclear when conditions would improve, as temperatures were supposed to remain below freezing until midday Sunday in Jackson. The conditions affected air travel across several states. In Virginia, most flights were canceled at Norfolk\u2019s airport because of the winter storm, the latest disruption to hit airports in the region. The website for Norfolk International Airport showed that every arriving flight was canceled for Saturday, as well as most departing flights.\u00a0 In North Carolina, Raleigh\u2019s airport said there were many cancellations and it expected very few flights to arrive or depart on Saturday. Charlotte\u2019s airport also said its operations were limited. It advised travelers to check their carrier for cancellations.\u00a0 Atlanta\u2019s airport said that some flights have been canceled but that regular takeoffs and landings were resuming.\u00a0 In the Northeast, officials at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport urged travelers to check with their airlines and numerous flights were canceled or delayed. \u00a0\u00a0 A crash involving as many as 20 vehicles closed a section of a Connecticut highway as heavy snow fell in southern New England. The pileup on Interstate 91 in Middletown occurred Saturday afternoon and involved at least three tractor-trailers. No serious injuries were reported. Up to 8 inches of snow were expected in parts of Connecticut, but areas along the southeastern Massachusetts coast could get 1 to 2 feet before the storm moves away later Saturday.\u00a0 Blizzard conditions were reported on Cape Cod and Plymouth County. Officials warned people to stay off the roads as the heavy snow and gusty winds were expected to reduce visibility to near zero.\u00a0 Mid-morning Saturday, snow began falling from New York City and points east.\u00a0 Predictions are for New York\u2019s Nassau County to see about 4-to-6 inches. Snow totals could reach 8-to-12 inches further east. Wind gusts could reach 25 to 30 mph. The New York Racing Association canceled Saturday\u2019s races at Aqueduct Racetrack because of the snow. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Suspect Charged With Federal Crimes in Fort Lauderdale Airport Attack By Morgan Winsor Jan 7, 2017, 7:19 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Alleged Gunman Esteban Santiago Arrives at Broward County Jail 0 Shares Email The man suspected of opening fire in a baggage claim area of a Florida airport Friday, killing five people and wounding six, allegedly told the FBI he had planned the attack and bought a one-way ticket to Fort Lauderdale to carry it out, according to an FBI affidavit. Esteban Santiago, 26, has been charged with federal crimes linked to the shooting, including performing an act of violence against a person at an airport, using a firearm in a crime of violence and causing death with a firearm. The charges come with the possibility of the death penalty. Investigators have found \"no specific reason\" why he chose the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and have yet to determine a motive for the shooting, which took place Friday afternoon just before 1 p.m. ET in the baggage claim at Terminal 2, according to George Piro, special agent in charge of the FBI's Miami office. \"We have not identified any triggers that would have caused this attack,\" Pirro said at a press conference Saturday morning. \"We're pursuing all angles on what prompted him to carry out this horrific attack.\" President Obama 'Heartbroken' for Victims' Families After Fort Lauderdale Shooting Senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News that Santiago arrived Friday at the airport in Fort Lauderdale on a flight from Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he had connected from a flight from Anchorage, Alaska, that he boarded Thursday night. The Associated Press People stand on the tarmac at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport after a shooter opened fire inside a terminal of the airport, killing several people and wounding others before being taken into custody, Friday, Jan. 6, 2017. Anchorage Airport Police and Fire officials told ABC News Santiago only checked one bag -- a hard case carrying his gun. TSA regulations allow guns to be checked into baggage if they are stored in a locked, hard-sided container that cannot be easily accessed. \"That is absolutely something that I think we need to revisit,\" U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said at the press conference Saturday morning. \"We have revisited our security measures at airports every time we\u2019ve had a security breach.\u201d According to court records, Santiago told authorities he loaded a Walther 9mm semi-automatic handgun in a bathroom at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, came out out and \"shot the first people he encountered.\" Santiago fired 10-15 rounds and was \"aiming at victims' heads,\" the FBI said in a sworn affidavit to support the federal criminal charges. Agents saw surveillance video that support witness statements that Santiago was \"walking while shooting in a methodical manner,\" the affidavit said. At one point he exited Terminal 2 baggage claim, walked outside and then re-entered. At that point a sheriff's deputy confronted him, and Santiago dropped the weapon, its ammunition spent, according to the affidavit. In his interview with the FBI, Santiago said \"he had planned the attack, purchasing a one-way ticket,\" according to the affidavit. Santiago confirmed he claimed the box with the gun, brought it into a bathroom, put the gun in his waistband, left the men's room and \"shot the first people he encountered.\" He emptied one magazine, reloaded, and then emptied another magazine, the affidavit said. In addition to those wounded initially amid the gunfire, dozens of others were injured after the incident. A total of 54 patients have been taken to Broward Health Medical Center since Friday's shooting. Of those 54, nine patients were admitted, six of them with gunshot wounds. As of Saturday afternoon, eight patients remain hospitalized at Broward Health Medical Center -- six are listed in good condition and two are in critical condition, the hospital said in a press release. Piro said law enforcement officials have identified the five victims and are in the process of notifying family members and loved ones. Their names have not been released. According to authorities, Santiago did not try to take any hostages during the incident, nor did he make any statements while firing the weapon. The FBI said they are not aware of any incident on board the flight or at the baggage claim that might have triggered the shooting. Law enforcement officials said Santiago was carrying military identification at the time of the incident. The suspect was apprehended and placed in federal custody. He was booked overnight at the Broward County Jail and is currently being held for murder, according to the Broward County Sheriff's Office. Santiago will likely make his first court appearance Monday, Piro said at the press conference Saturday. The Associated Press Esteban Santiago, 26, the suspect in the deadly shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, is transported to the Broward County Main Jail by authorities, Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017. More details are beginning to emerge about the suspected gunman. Santiago, who spent nine years in the military, was a combat engineer with the Alaska Army National Guard and left the military in August, according to Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, director of public affairs for the Alaska National Guard. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions at the rank of Private First Class. Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007 and was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011. Along the way, he earned a number of awards, including the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal, according to his service record. A senior law enforcement official told ABC News that Santiago walked into the FBI's Anchorage field office in November last year after his discharge from the military and said he was under mind control by a U.S. intelligence agency. The official said he appeared incoherent and agitated, saying the U.S. government was trying to force him to watch ISIS videos. The official said Santiago stated he didn't want to hurt anyone. Still, the FBI contacted local law enforcement, which, out of caution, had him medically evaluated. The FBI closed the probe after reviewing databases and interviewing family, the official told ABC News. Broward County Sheriffs Office Esteban Santiago's booking record with the Broward County Sheriff's Office. The Associated Press This booking photo provided by the Broward Sheriff's Office shows suspect Esteban Ruiz Santiago, 26, Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Sources told ABC News that Santiago had received mental health treatment after the encounter with the FBI in Anchorage. A person who answered the phone for Signal 88 -- a company in Anchorage where Santiago worked in a security capacity -- told ABC News it has no comment and is \"currently under the advisement of federal authorities.\" A senior law enforcement official briefed on the case told ABC News that authorities are \"tearing apart\" Santiago's service record to determine if he was suffering from PTSD. The FBI said investigators are also reviewing Santiago's social media accounts and online activity. During a press conference Saturday morning, FBI special agent in charge Piro said they have interviewed Santiago and members of his family. Local and federal authorities now are in the process of conducting further interviews and pursuing leads in south Florida and several locations throughout the United States. So far, officials interviewed 175 witnesses and have recovered various video and physical evidence, Piro said. \"God have mercy not only for us but for everyone,\" Santiago's aunt, Maria Ruiz, speaking in Spanish, told reporters outside her Union City, N.J., home Friday. \"I am really sorry. I am so sad.\" The Associated Press Employees and passengers walk into the parking garage near the scene of a deadly shooting at Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport, Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport was closed to departing and arriving flights following the deadly shooting. Cargo and general aviation (private small planes, corporate jets) operations resumed at midnight, the airport said on its Twitter page. Marke Gale, aviation director of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, said the airport resumed its operations for commercial and passenger services at 5 a.m. ET Saturday. But Gale warned that there may still be cancellations and delays due to poor weather conditions and the aftermath of the shooting. Terminal 2, the location of the shooting, remained closed Saturday morning, Gale said. Allan Siegel, the airport's committee outreach coordinator, told ABC News the two airlines that fly out of Terminal 2 -- Delta Airlines and Air Canada -- will operate from other terminals. At the press conference Saturday morning, Gale said airport officials have collected more than 20,000 various personal items that were left behind during the evacuation, including luggage, cellphones and laptops. Passengers can call 1-866-435-9355 to report their missing items, Gale said. \"We are in the process of cataloguing all those items, protecting it, securing it so we can get it back to its rightful owner as soon as we possibly can,\" he told reporters. \"Please understand it's going to take some time to process that large number of items.\" Hundreds of passengers who spent the night at nearby Port Everglades were brought back on buses Saturday to the airport to catch their flights. The Red Cross provided bedding, food and water for the displaced passengers. Wasserman Schultz said Florida is working with its partners in \"a united front\" to cope and heal from the mass shooting. \"This is obviously a horrific tragedy and we are devastated that this happened in our hometown, in our corner of paradise,\" she told reporters Saturday morning.

Wootson Jr. January 7 at 4:48 PM Follow @CleveWootson Esteban Santiago grabbed his bag from the luggage carousel at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and walked to the bathroom. There, he pulled bullets and a 9 mm pistol from his baggage, loaded the weapon and returned to fire randomly at his fellow travelers, authorities said Friday. A minute later, they said, he had killed five people, injured six and raised questions about how a person bent on harming people could legally fly across\u00a0the country with a gun, then use it to attack unsuspecting passengers. The answer: very easily. The Transportation Security Administration allows passengers to carry guns and ammunition in their checked luggage, provided they follow the rules. [ Suspect in Fort Lauderdale shooting \u2018lost his mind\u2019 in Iraq, family says ] The gun has to be locked in a hard-sided case. Usually, there\u2019s a form to fill out. The gun can\u2019t be loaded, but the rules allow passengers to also carry ammunition, sometimes in the same case.\u00a0The TSA has a helpful video with cheery music \u00a0detailing the process. Santiago, an Army veteran from Alaska who complained that the government was controlling his mind,\u00a0 was arrested following the mass shooting and remained jailed Saturday in Broward County, Fla. Under Florida law, people can\u2019t carry guns in airport terminals unless they\u2019re still in the case, although a bill before the legislature would allow people to openly carry guns in public places, including airports. Passengers routinely check their weapons at the Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage, where Santiago initially departed from, Jesse Davis, the chief of police, told The Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019re a big hunting state, so we get quite a lot of that,\u201d he said, adding that for Santiago\u2019s check-in procedure, \u201ceverything appeared normal.\u201d Passengers evacuate from Terminal 1 at Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport on Friday. (Paul E. Kostyu via Associated Press) Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u00a0(D-Fla.), whose district includes the airport where the mass shooting occurred, said she plans to revisit rules for flying with firearms when she returns to Washington this week. \u201cWhile we take a look at balancing the public\u2019s need to be able to freely travel, at the same time we need to protect the traveling public who is traveling alongside someone who may decide to do them harm,\u201d she said. \u201cFederal rules do allow for firearms to be carried in checked baggage not in carry on baggage and there were procedures that were followed in this case.\u201d She said that she also plans to examine policies on unsecured areas in airports and other places frequented by the traveling public. \u201cWe need to take a hard look at the security around baggage claim areas.\u201d [ Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer was nearly caught in shooting ] According to the TSA, guns are allowed in checked baggage, but lighters shaped like guns aren\u2019t. Also prohibited in checked bags: many aerosol cans, electronic cigarettes, liquid bleach, recreational oxygen, safety matches and most spillable batteries. At a news conference on Jan. 7, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) said the rampage at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport shows there's a need to review whether people should be able to travel with their firearms at airports and security around baggage claim areas. (Reuters) While carrying guns in checked baggage in generally allowed, passengers who attempt to carry firearms into the seating areas of planes can face stiff penalties and prison time. That doesn\u2019t stop many people from attempting to tote guns onto airplanes anyway. In 2015, TSA officers discovered a record 2,653 guns in carry-on bags at airport\u00a0security checkpoints, a 20 percent jump from 2014. Numbers for 2016 aren\u2019t available yet, but in one week last year, officers discovered a record 78 guns in carry-on bags, according to the TSA\u2019s blog . Sixty-eight were loaded. 98.4% of all mass shootings since 1950 have taken place in \"gun free zones\" like #FtLauderdale 's airport. https://t.co/bBF9yOZZDv \u2014 Bob Owens (@bob_owens) January 7, 2017 Being afraid of getting shot \u2014 in airports, schools, churches \u2014 isn't freedom.

Authorities have referred Tyler Odell, right, for a possible charge of being a party to a reckless homicide, but he has not been formally charged. Robert Sterling, left, of McHenry, was charged with first-degree reckless homicide and homicide by negligent handling of a dangerous weapon. Authorities have referred Tyler Odell, right, for a possible charge of being a party to a reckless homicide, but he has not been formally charged. (Walworth County Sheriff's Office) Amanda MarrazzoChicago Tribune Two people are in custody in the death of a McHenry man who was fatally shot in the face after a drunken game of Russian roulette, authorities said. David Bauspies, 36, died after he was shot Monday in an apartment in East Troy, Wis. According to a criminal complaint filed Friday in Walworth County, East Troy police responded to the apartment at about 12:30 p.m. that day to investigate a report of gunfire. When they arrived, they discovered another McHenry man, Robert Sterling, 31, kneeling over Bauspies' \"deceased\" body, a revolver lying on the floor nearby and \"a large amount of blood on the wall and surrounding the victim,\" the complaint said. The document also stated that Sterling had blood on his hands and clothing. Authorities said a man who lives in the apartment, Tyler Odell, 22, later told East Troy police that Sterling and Bauspies had been drinking beer and were \"pretty drunk,\" according to the complaint. Odell \"decided to show everyone his gun,\" a .44 Magnum revolver, after removing its six rounds of ammunition, the complaint said. Odell told authorities he then put one round back in the gun, spun the cylinder and aimed the revolver at his own head but did not pull the trigger, according to the court record. Odell told police he then handed the gun to Sterling, who \"spun the cylinder, held the gun up to (his own) head, and pulled the trigger,\" but the gun did not fire. Odell said Sterling \"then pointed the gun at Bauspies and pulled the trigger, causing the gun to fire,\" according to the criminal complaint. ",

Every state is reporting influenza outbreaks, and it looks a little worse than last year's relatively mild season looked at this point, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Weekly Influenza Surveillance Report CDC Flu is most widespread in the northwest \u2014 California, Washington, Oregon and Idaho \u2014 and in parts of the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the CDC reported in its weekly look at the virus. Related: Birth Year May Affect Your Flu Risk. Here's How Some hospitals in Washington state have been hit hard, with people suffering from flu and other winter infections. \"It's been very busy. The hospital's been at capacity,\" said Malloree Fontanilla, a registered nurse who runs the emergency center at Providence St. Peter Hospital in Olympia, Washington. \"We have had a very full emergency center,\" Fontanilla told KING television. That's not unusual for flu, and there are other viruses and bacterial infections in the winter, also \u2014 from norovirus to the bacteria that cause strep throat. Related: No FluMist This Year Flu usually hits the very young and the very old the hardest. Depending on the season, it kills anywhere between 4,000 and 50,000 people a year in the United States. Because each flu case is not counted, public health experts have to estimate flu's toll, and don't get a good picture until the end of the season. \"So far in the 2016-2017 influenza season, Influenza A (H3N2) viruses have been identified most frequently in the U.S.,\" the CDC says.

    "text": "AP January 7, 2017, 2:30 PM Scientists watch growing Antarctic crack but aren't alarmed This Nov. 10, 2016, aerial photo released by NASA shows a rift in the Antarctic Peninsula\u2019s Larsen C ice shelf. John Sonntag/NASA via AP New images show the long-watched rift in the Larsen C ice shelf grew 11 miles in the last few weeks. The crack is now about 60 miles long and about 300 feet wide. If it grows another dozen miles, a Delaware-sized iceberg could break off and float away. University of Colorado scientist Ted Scambos said that could happen soon, likely in March, and would \u201ccut deeper to the bone\u201d of the ice shelf, changing its shape. Ice shelves - sheets of floating ice - wrap around three-quarters of the South Pole\u2019s coastline. They provide protection and support for inland glaciers. Scambos, who is about to travel to Antarctica for research, and other scientists said they don\u2019t see other key signs that this growing crack would result in a catastrophic collapse of the entire shelf. A chunk of ice will break off, \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to lead to a runaway disintegration,\u201d he said Friday. That\u2019s what happened suddenly in 2002 to the smaller Larsen B shelf, allowing inland glaciers to shrink rapidly. NASA glaciologist Jay Zwally said there\u2019s no rapid melting with ponds of water on top of the ice this time. \u201cBy itself this calving is not a cause for alarm,\u201d Zwally said. Large icebergs do periodically break off from Antarctica naturally, Zwally said. \u201cBut the ice shelf has been thinning as other ice shelves have been thinning in the Antarctic peninsula,\u201d he said. There\u2019s no evidence linking this crack to climate change, yet it fits the overall warming picture, said Adrian Luckman, a researcher at Swansea University in England, which has been monitoring the crack. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

    "text": "DEC. 30, 2016 By The New York Times Jamie S. Gorelick, a WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration, said that while plans were not final, Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business. \u201cMr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,\u201d she said. He will resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, and though the law does not require it, she said he would divest \u201csubstantial assets.\u201d She did not name them, but Ms. Heller said they would include his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue. Just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen. Mr. Kushner\u2019s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies\u2019 properties, and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 Fifth Avenue. He also has a stake, through a family investment vehicle, in a private equity firm run by his brother, Joshua, with far-flung investments of its own. Mr. Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit. Already he is involved in steering policy, making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders, the White House and the president-elect in ways that could affect his business, even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the president-elect\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner played a pivotal role in persuading Mr. Trump, who made the Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs a b\u00eate noire of his presidential campaign, to appoint the firm\u2019s president, Gary D. Cohn , as his chief economic adviser, according to several people involved in the transition. (Like a number of people interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.) Goldman Sachs has lent the Kushner Companies money and is an investor in a real estate technology company co-founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother. Photo A Bank Hapoalim branch in Tel Aviv. The bank has given multiple loans to Kushner Companies. Credit Nir Elias/Reuters Mr. Trump has said that his son-in-law, an Orthodox Jew, will play a central role in dealings with Israel , describing him as so talented that he could help \u201cdo peace in the Middle East.\u201d Mr. Kushner\u2019s company has received multiple loans from Israel\u2019s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim. The incoming Trump administration will inherit a Justice Department investigation into allegations that the bank helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, despite a lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of America\u2019s most complicated diplomatic relationships. Such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention should be relayed through his son-in-law, according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement. So when the Chinese ambassador to the United States called the White House in early December to express what one official called China\u2019s \u201cdeep displeasure\u201d at Mr. Trump\u2019s break with longstanding diplomatic tradition by speaking by phone with the president of Taiwan , the White House did not call the president-elect\u2019s national security team. Instead, it relayed that information through Mr. Kushner, whose company was not only in the midst of discussions with Anbang but also has Chinese investors. Ethics experts said that while the conflict-of-interest law is narrowly drawn, Mr. Kushner\u2019s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions. Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, said deals like the one with Anbang \u201cmight not be illegal under the conflict-of-interest rules, but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner\u2019s business to try to influence U.S. policy.\u201d Without knowing details of Mr. Kushner\u2019s holdings and divestiture plans, he said, the merits of his proposal are hard to assess. Even if he divests his stake in certain properties, Mr. Sanderson added, \u201cit strikes me as a half-measure\u201d that \u201cstill poses a real conflict-of-interest issue and would be a drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and cause the American people to question Mr. Kushner\u2019s role in policy making.\u201d Photo From left, Josh, Charles and Jared Kushner, in 2014. The family has extensive holdings in real estate and private equity firms. Credit Patrick McMullan The Family Business Like the president-elect, Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful father. In the 1980s, his father, Charles Kushner, took over the New Jersey-based construction business started by his own father, a Holocaust survivor from Poland. Charles expanded into office buildings and apartments, eventually assembling a $1 billion real estate business and becoming a leading Democratic donor , contributing to politicians in New Jersey and New York and winning appointment to the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But the company was upended when Charles became engulfed in a nasty family feud over how the business\u2019s proceeds were to be distributed. The fight, which played out in a federal courthouse in Newark, resulted in a plea deal for Charles, who in 2005 was sentenced to two years in prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations. The family infighting was so bitter that, at one point, Charles hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, videotaped the encounter and sent the footage to his sister. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jared, 23 at the time of his father\u2019s conviction, had recently graduated from Harvard. He was studying for an M.B.A. and law degree at New York University in 2006 when he bought The New York Observer, at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city\u2019s elite and high-end real estate. It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business. The company now says he became chief executive in 2008, but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012. Nevertheless, Mr. Kushner quickly became the company\u2019s public face as it expanded across the Hudson River into Manhattan, much as Mr. Trump had left Queens for the big city decades before. Charles Kushner was released from federal custody in August 2006. He immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today. Still, it was with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever: $1.8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day. It was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the United States \u2014 and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier. Around this time, Mr. Kushner met the woman he would marry: Ivanka Trump. \u201cJ-Vanka,\u201d the headlines blared , as the New York tabloids celebrated a match made in real estate heaven. Everything was looking up, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Within a year after the deal, the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans \u2014 and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue. To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity firm; Vornado Realty Trust, then a co-owner of two of Mr. Trump\u2019s largest properties; and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men. In the end, Mr. Kushner\u2019s company survived, and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international boldface-name circuit. In August, they were spotted with Wendi Deng, an ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, on the 453-foot yacht Rising Sun, owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen. Several weeks later, they were photographed watching the United States Open tennis finals with the art collector Dasha Zhukova, wife of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle. Since 2012, Kushner Companies has been on a buying spree. It has acquired at least 120 properties, mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New Jersey, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, a research firm. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Recent deals include the $340 million acquisition of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and $345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land. Mr. Kushner\u2019s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times building for $295 million in 2015 from Lev Leviev, an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia. Increasingly, the company is branching out across the country \u2014 to Philadelphia; Baltimore; Toledo, Ohio; and Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of AT&T. In all, the company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.

Credit Jean Catuffe/GC Images Investors and Creditors As the Kushners have expanded their businesses, they have also, by necessity, expanded their universe of investors and creditors. Lenders have included private equity giants like Blackstone, the French bank Natixis and Goldman Sachs. Another lender is Deutsche Bank, which recently reached a $7.2 billion settlement with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities. But it remains under investigation over allegations that it disguised trades that helped Russian clients move money offshore. Beyond real estate, Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall Street, health care and tech spaces. He has an indirect investment in Thrive Capital, a venture capital firm valued at about $1.5 billion that is run by his brother, Joshua. The company has made more than 100 investments in dozens of companies, both in the United States and abroad. Among them is Oscar , a health insurance company founded in 2012 to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle. Oscar\u2019s investors have included Li Ka-shing, who is one of Hong Kong\u2019s richest men, and China\u2019s Ping An Insurance, which has close ties to relatives of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China.

Goldman Sachs has invested in both tech ventures. But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner\u2019s real-estate investments remains a mystery. While the company lists dozens of partners on its website, it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies. One of the newest Kushner projects \u2014 a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in November in Jersey City \u2014 got nearly a quarter of its financing, about $50 million, from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified. The investors are beneficiaries of a federal program that grants two-year visas and a path to permanent residency in exchange for investments of $500,000. The program, known as EB-5, has become popular with real estate developers as a cheap form of financing; in fiscal year 2015, the State Department issued 9,764 of the visas \u2014 overwhelmingly to applicants from China .

The Government Accountability Office has issued several reports raising concerns about what it termed the program\u2019s insufficient background checks and lax safeguards against illicit financing. One applicant, the agency found, failed to report potential financial ties to a string of Chinese brothels . Then there are the Kushners\u2019 continuing negotiations with Anbang\u2019s Mr. Wu, one of the most politically connected men in China.

The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the 40-story, 1950s-era aluminum-clad office building, adding apartments, a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1,400 feet. But the plan needed money, and while Mr. Kushner had managed to hang on to his family\u2019s flagship building, it still had a lot of debt, with a $1.1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant. Anbang, which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004, had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate, and had begun investing in hotels. But it had encountered problems of its own; its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington. The Times reported last year that Anbang is owned by a few dozen companies, which in turn are owned by a number of shell companies that are controlled by roughly 100 people, many of whom have ties to a county in China that is the home of Mr. Wu, whose own power stems in part from marriage. In his case he married Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era. Mr. Wu also counts as a central business partner the son of a People\u2019s Liberation Army marshal, and he has recruited several former government insurance regulators to serve on his board.

Credit Ben Asen/International Insurance Society Anbang\u2019s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, have opted not to advise the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their \u201cknow your client\u201d guidelines. Anbang\u2019s deep ties to the Chinese state have also led to a break in presidential protocol. Presidents have long stayed at the Waldorf, but when Mr. Obama visited New York for the opening of a session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, he decided to seek other accommodations . American officials were vague about the reasons for the change at the time; a senior national security official cited security, counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns. Advertisement Continue reading the main story National security concerns have also complicated Anbang\u2019s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States. One deal, to buy the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or state-connected companies. The Hotel del Coronado is near a naval base, and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny. Anbang was, however, able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection. Last year, Anbang tried to purchase the Starwood Hotels chain, outbidding Marriott with a $14 billion offer . It was widely reported that the deal would be subject to review by the committee. But though the parties expressed confidence that it would pass muster, ultimately Anbang walked away from the deal before submitting the kind of detailed inside information that process would entail. And while Anbang\u2019s planned $1.57 billion purchase of Des Moines-based Fidelity & Guaranty Life, first announced in November 2015, was cleared by the committee, also known as Cfius, it stalled after the New York State Department of Financial Services demanded more information about Anbang\u2019s shareholding structure.

Credit Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images But Anbang was nothing if not savvy. Company officials had cultivated a relationship with Benjamin M. Lawsky, who had earlier led the financial services agency, from May 2011 to June 2015. It was Mr. Lawsky, by then a consultant, who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies, according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about. Mr. Lawsky declined to comment. Mr. Kushner led the negotiations, his spokeswoman, Ms. Heller, confirmed. Kushner Companies would disclose little else about the joint venture, except to say that Anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building\u2019s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized. Anbang declined to comment. It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner\u2019s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election, Ms. Heller said, adding that it had been in the works for a while. By the time of the meeting, Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships, including the one with Anbang, to others at Kushner Companies, according to Ms. Heller, and it was for that reason that he invited his father and Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies. She said he planned to sell his stake in 666 Fifth before the closing of any Anbang deal, but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price Mr. Kushner hoped to get. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Heller stressed in her statement that the United States has \u201cnot found Anbang to be a state-owned enterprise\u201d \u2014 an important technical point, given that the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments. Should it consummate its deal with Anbang, she said, Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government. She expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee, citing the fact that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria. Come Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, that committee will be made up of his cabinet members, and the process is such that the president has the final say. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More It is a process with which Mr. Trump has some familiarity. During the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting, as secretary of state and member of the foreign investment committee, a deal that benefited donors to her family\u2019s charitable foundation while giving the Russians control of about 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium-extraction capacity. On China, Mr. Trump has talked a tough game, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war. But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen. The president-elect has his own financial entanglements with China: He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly $950 million to a group of lenders that includes the Bank of China, and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is another state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. With Anbang a magnet for controversy, Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps. But a week after the Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf, Mr. Kushner\u2019s father and Mr. Wu met at the hotel for lunch. After the elder Mr. Kushner departed, Mr. Wu was clearly elated. \u201cI love you guys,\u201d he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage, according to one person present. ",

Atmospheric rivers are key to California's rainfall. Louis Sahagun , Joseph Serna , Tony Barboza and Paige St. John Contact Reporters The first band of what forecasters predict will be the region\u2019s\u00a0most powerful storm in a decade moved into Northern California on Saturday, prompting official\u00a0warnings of widespread\u00a0flooding and\u00a0epic snowfall. \u201cPeople are definitely in a state of panic right now,\u201d\u00a0said El Dorado County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Todd Hammitt.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of calls asking if we\u2019re going to be able to deal with everything. It\u2019s the general pandemonium of not knowing what\u2019s coming.\u201d The storm system \u2014\u00a0known as an atmospheric river \u2014\u00a0could dump so much rain and snow that some ski runs and roads will be declared off-limits, with\u00a0forecasters warning of significant flooding, mudslides and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada. Up to 12 inches of rain is expected to fall on areas below 8,500 feet\u00a0beginning Saturday morning,\u00a0and up to 7\u00a0feet of snow could bury higher elevations, according to the\u00a0 National Weather Service .\u00a0Forecasters said\u00a0the storm was\u00a0packing the same wallop as one that hit Northern California in 2005, causing\u00a0$300 million in damage. Live updates: Winter weather slams California \u00bb This weekend\u2019s system could bring 36 consecutive\u00a0hours of heavy rain from Mammoth Mountain to Susanville, in Lassen County. Though that\u00a0 is good news \u00a0for California, which is entering its sixth year of drought,\u00a0the coming rain could melt already standing snow \u2014 feeding watersheds swollen from storms earlier this week, forecasters said.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a busy weekend,\u201d said Edan Weishahn, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno, sighing.\u00a0 The rain moved in late Friday and continued into Saturday morning, with the most powerful punch expected later in the day. In the eastern Sierra Nevada, snow continued to fall\u00a0at higher elevations while rain drizzled lower down as officials warned that wetter, rainier conditions on tap for later this weekend could spell trouble. Officials toiling to keep highways clear said they were\u00a0concerned about a warmer phase of the storm that could fall as rain even at higher elevations, melting the built-up snow and unleashing mudslides, flooding and avalanches. \"It's the rain over the snow that we're worried about,\" said Greg Miller, a Caltrans maintenance manager. \"We've had snow since Christmas, but now with the warmer trend, we're worried about water.\" With storm drains frozen, he said, an influx of rain could send water and mud into roadways. Miller said crews were taking special precautions to prevent rockslides from a segment of U.S. 395 near Lee Vining and avalanches from several other critical transportation corridors. Friday morning, Caltrans closed part of California 120 near June Lake while a crew set out off remotely detonated charges to clear avalanche-prone slopes of accumulating snow. Crews were plowing, sanding and blowing snow from roadways around the clock in 12-hour shifts, Miller said. The California Highway Patrol responded to several reports of rolled-over vehicles and other snow-related collisions on U.S.\u00a0395. Tire chain restrictions were in effect across much of the Sierra Nevada. Residents in Mammoth Lakes are concerned that warm rain and slush will dam up behind banks of shoveled snow piled high in empty lots and along roads throughout town, then flow wherever it can find a path, clogging existing drainage systems with debris and ice. \u201cIn this town, we don\u2019t even have rain gutters because they get ripped down by snow,\u201d said Lisa Isaacs, a resident and environmental activist. \u201cSo, we\u2019re very worried that this storm will flood homes and garages.\u201d The National Weather Service issued a flood watch warning for Sunday, and town officials advised residents to stock up on water, food, first aid supplies, clothing and bedding, tools and emergency supplies, along with special items for medical conditions. On a winter war footing, Mammoth Lakes residents lined up throughout the day on Saturday at the town\u2019s utility yard to load up on 40-pound sandbags they hoped would steer waves of slush away from homes, ground-floor condominiums and businesses. Among them were Mammoth Lakes residents Greg Newbry, 66, a recently retired Mono County employee, and his wife, Linda Salcido, 67, Mono County\u2019s director of public health. \u201cI was here in 1982 when this town was wrecked by massive flooding,\u201d Newbry recalled. \u201cMain Street was under 2 feet of water. Businesses closed. The roofs of five mobile homes collapsed under the weight of rain on snow. \u201cIf we get all the rain predicted in the forecasts,\u201d he added, \u201cevery slab of concrete at ground level is vulnerable, and we live in a ground-floor condominium.\u201d As she helped tote 20 sandbags to their vehicle, Salcido said she was concerned about\u00a0the potential effects of flooding countywide. \u201cSnow, even lots and lots of it, we can handle,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a major flood event would lead to countless challenges.\u201d Up on Mammoth Mountain, the mood was more upbeat as thousands of skiers and snowboarders raced down slopes that had received as much as 80 inches of snow over the last week alone. Rising 11,000 feet from a gap in the Sierra Nevada range, Mammoth Mountain\u2019s steep chutes stand in the path of freshly brewed atmospheric river systems. With relatively low mountains to the west of it, Mammoth receives most of their unspent snow. But big snowfall, high winds, warm rain and rising temperatures are forces that transform pile powder into unstable clumps that set off avalanches. So Mammoth Mountain Resort specialists were bringing snowpacks down with artillery including howitzers. Down in Mammoth Lakes, Isaacs\u00a0spent Saturday hoping that \u201cthe rain they keep talking about will turn out to be snow.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019ll probably be like having a giant fire big hose turned on us and we\u2019ll be swamped,\u201d she said with a nervous laugh. \u201cI just hope that my little $150 water pump can keep with it.\u201d Mammoth Mountain Chief Executive Rusty Gregory had few answers. \u201cThe main topic of conversation over cocktails on Sunday night,\u201d he mused, \u201cwill be about what actually happened.\u201d As snow and rain continued to dump over the Sierra Nevada, highway patrols and maintenance crews were kept busy Friday responding to snow-related accidents and icy road conditions. Steve Coons operated a massive Caltrans wing plow. Its engine strained as it worked in tandem with another truck to clear and sand two northbound lanes of U.S. 395 north of Bishop, a key transportation corridor along the Eastern Sierra Nevada. From behind the wheel of the rumbling truck, Coons can feel the weight of the heavy, wet snow as it pushes against the plow blade and is shoved to the side of the highway. \u201cThe truck is really chugging,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long day.\u201d Coons monitors closely the consistency of the snow, which wavers between soft, large flakes and icy shards. The more that it falls as rain and ice, the more he worries it will make the roads slick and cause serious trouble for drivers. \u201cAs soon as it gets cold all this ices up,\u201d Coons said. \u201cNot good.\u201d He and other plow operators are on the roads 24 hours a day, working 12-hour shifts. They will have no shortage of snow to clear with the series of storm cells expected to continue dumping moisture over the area for days. \u201cOur guys have pretty much been on since Christmas, and it\u2019s not letting up,\u201d said Greg Miller, maintenance manager for Caltrans District 9, which includes Inyo, Mono and eastern Kern counties. The storm was also bringing wind gusts that topped 50 mph. Officials said they were low snow and icy conditions on Interstate 5 and 80 as well as U.S. 50 and some mountain highways. The National Weather Service on Saturday released a new timeline for the storms moving through the region: Saturday: Moderate to heavy snow in mountain areas. Sunday: Heaviest rain and snow, with risks of flooding. Monday: Showers and snow continue, with continued flood risk. Tuesday: New storm moves in, lower snow levels, flood risk. Wednesday: Showers and snow, with rivers running high. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting heavy, heavy rain. It starts out as snow then turns to rain then turns to snow again,\u201d Hammitt said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the melt increasing waterways and all the lakes.\u201d Hammitt recalled storms in 1997 and 2005\u00a0when\u00a0runoff overwhelmed local rivers and creeks and sent water into roads and homes,\u00a0lifting some buildings\u00a0off their foundations. \u201cWe have streams, creeks, rivers. We have lakes and ponds,\u201d Hammitt said. \u201cAnybody near a water source could be in jeopardy depending on the severity of the storm.\u201d Two sinkholes have been reported on El Dorado County roads as a result of\u00a0three days of rain\u00a0this week. Residents have already filled 12,000 sandbags in preparation for the storm and an additional 20,000 were on the way in, Hammitt said.\u00a0 \u201cAnytime it\u2019s Mother Nature, you have to be ready,\u201d Hammitt said.

(Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports) HOUSTON \u2013 They harassed him, they puzzled him, they intercepted him, and the Houston Texans\u2019 defense dominated the Oakland Raiders and rookie quarterback Connor Cook. Oakland snapped a 13-year streak without a postseason appearance, but the Raiders stumbled Saturday evening in their wild card round game against the Texans, 27-14. Houston quarterback Brock Osweiler managed the game in his first start since being benched in the middle of a Week 15 victory. Osweiler was 14-for-25 for 168 yards and 1 touchdown\u00a0on Saturday. With Jadeveon Clowney -- who had an interception to set up the first Texans' touchdown -- and Houston\u2019s defense smothering Oakland, all the Texans needed from Osweiler was to avoid the big mistake, and that\u2019s what the high-priced free agent acquisition did. The Texans had switched to Tom Savage, but Savage was ruled out with a concussion suffered last week. Cook, a rookie fourth-round pick, made his first career start in place of Derek Carr, who broke his leg Week 16. Cook could never settle into a rhythm and completed only 18 of 45 passes for 161 \u00a0yards, 1 touchdown, and 3 interceptions. Backup Matt McGloin was healthy enough to dress for the game, but did not play after suffering an injury to his left, non-throwing shoulder in the season finale. If the No. 3 seed Steelers defeat the No. 6 Dolphins Sunday afternoon, Houston will travel to New England to face the top-seeded Patriots in the divisional round. If Miami wins, however, the Texans will head to Kansas City to battle the second-seeded Chiefs. ",

News Journal Published 4:09 p.m. ET Jan. 7, 2017 | Updated 4 hours ago Dr. Frank Butler in his examination room at Naval Hospital Pensacola (Photo: Melissa Nelson Gabriel/mnelsongab@pnj.com) PENSACOLA, Fla. \u2014 An eye surgeon and former Navy SEAL who helped transform battlefield medicine is on the front line of a national push to save the lives of civilians targeted in mass shootings and terror attacks. Frank Butler, 67, of Pensacola was the command surgeon for U.S. special operations when American forces entered Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Because of his work, all American soldiers deployed in war zones today carry tourniquets as part of their standard-issue equipment \u2014 a move credited with saving hundreds of lives. \"Dr. Butler is a very big deal and he is the most unassuming person you will ever meet. He has made a profound, profound, influence on the military and now the civilian side,\" said Butler's friend Lenworth Jacobs, director of trauma and emergency medicine at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut and a regent for the American College of Surgeons. \"(Butler's) work is incredibly important. The death rate in the military from bleeding went from 7.2 to 2.6 percent, that is a phenomenal drop,\" Jacobs said. Butler and Jacobs joined forces after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children. Florida airport shooting: Victims' names released, more on what we know now The governor of Connecticut asked Jacobs to head a panel of experts that reviewed the medical response and suggest improvements. That work led to the White House's \"Stop The Bleed\" campaign, which advocates for tourniquets and hemostatic gauze dressings, used to apply pressure and stop the bleeding in torso wounds, to be easily available in public places like airports, schools, night clubs and sporting venues. Butler is part of the national campaign and its work to train first responders and civilians about what to do in the moments after a mass-casualty attack. Jacobs said Butler's push for greater use of tourniquets in the military paved the way for better treatment of civilians. \"It is really hard to get people to change, and he got the United States military to change. He is a leader who is a passionate advocate,\" Jacobs said. Butler, who is an ophthalmologist at Pensacola Naval Hospital, has for many years shunned publicity about his work or his time with the SEALs. He prefers to let the world know about his work through his many medical papers. When describing his accomplishments, he always includes a lengthy list of the people he worked with to create the medical advances. Sign in Iraq for road named for Pensacola Dr. Frank Butler \u00a0(Photo: Frank Butler) He is so unassuming, that many of his longtime hospital coworkers do not know he is a former SEAL platoon commander. \"He will talk about his experiences as a SEAL sometimes, but he doesn't brag about it,\" said Lt. Cmdr. Gavin McEwan, the hospital's department head for ophthalmology. Butler shared his story with The News Journal\u00a0to help spread the message about how to stop bleeding. \"I think there are a lot of things about what SEALs and special forces do that shouldn't be discussed in public, but the medical aspects of what we do, I care very much that any advances we make in learning how to keep SEALs alive are shared,\" he said. Butler, a native of Savannah who played basketball at Georgia Tech University, joined the SEALs in 1971. He was a platoon commander in SEAL Team ONE and deployed to the waters off Southeast Asia. Four years later, he went to medical school. \u201cThere are a lot of overlaps between the SEALs and the medical community.  You have to have good reasoning skills to be a SEAL and part of SEAL training is learning to think through problems.\u201d Dr. Frank Butler \"There are a lot of overlaps between the SEALs and the medical community. You have to have good reasoning skills to be a SEAL, and part of SEAL training is learning to think through problems,\" he said. Before completing his residency in ophthalmology, he worked as a medical researcher at the Navy's Experimental Diving Unit in Panama City. He helped develop diving equipment and techniques to allow SEALs to stay underwater for longer periods at shallow depths using a lighter-weight oxygen rebreathing system without creating surface bubbles. Butler's medical interests evolved from a focus on emergency medicine to ophthalmology during the five years he spent at the Experimental Diving Unit. After joining the ophthalmology staff at Naval Hospital Pensacola in the late 1980s, Butler expected to spend the remainder of his professional career treating local patients. \"But I got an opportunity from the admiral in charge of the Navy SEALS to come back and that was the start of the Naval Special Warfare Biomedical Research Program. We looked at everything that we could do to help SEALs to do their missions and to treat SEALs if they were injured from diving or from combat,\" he said. Traveler says laptop saved him during Florida airport shooting In the years before the 9/11 attacks, Butler worked with other military medical leaders on a major review of U.S. battlefield medicine guidelines. Their research found that many deaths happened because of major blood loss, which could be stemmed with the rapid and proper application of a tourniquet. The group presented its findings in 1996 but had a tough time overcoming the medical community's strong aversion to tourniquets. The thinking at the time was that tourniquets could do more harm than good by cutting off blood flow to the limb. \"That is true if you put a tourniquet on and leave it on for a long period of time, it is not true if you put it on and leave it on for an hour or two. That gives us enough time to get the casualty to the hospital where surgeons can operate on the leg, fix the bleeding site, take the tourniquet off and restore the blood flow, \" he said. Advances in the speed of moving the wounded off the battlefield and into surgery meant that tourniquets could be removed relatively quickly, but U.S. special forces entered Afghanistan without carrying the tourniquets and hemostatic dressings. \"It was difficult to convince people that the teachings about tourniquets and other aspects of pre-hospital trauma care were incorrect. It was the war that helped us to see that,\" he said. A review of the first 82 special forces fatalities in Afghanistan found that 70 could not have been saved because they died in plane crashes, massive explosions and other non-survivable incidents. The review also found that 12 of the dead might have been saved if their bleeding could have been stopped in time. \"We realized that people were bleeding to death because they didn't have a $20 tourniquet. Think of us spending two years to train a Green Beret or SEAL, sending them off to war and then having them get shot in the leg and bleed to death because they didn't have a tourniquet,\" he said. \u201cWe realized that people were bleeding to death because they didn't have a $20 tourniquet. Think of us spending two years to train a Green Beret or SEAL, sending them off to war and then having them get shot in the leg and bleed to death because they didn't have a tourniquet.\u201d Dr. Frank Butler After the casualty review, the military awarded $7 million for Butler and others to rapidly supply U.S. special forces with tourniquets and hemostatic dressings and teach them how to uses the tools in the field. Because of the lives saved with that effort, the military began supplying everyone sent to combat zones with the life-saving equipment. Butler said the golden hour \u2014 the critical time to transport a causality off the battlefield for treatment \u2014 is actually a \"golden five minutes\" when it comes to bleeding. \"If you are shot in a major vessel, there is no golden hour. Fortunately it only takes 30 seconds to put on one of these tourniquets,\" he said, displaying the small, plastic-wrapped device carried by American troops. The next step in saving lives is ensuring that both first responders and civilians understand how important it is to stop bleeding. Also important is training police in how to assess a threat while stopping victims from bleeding to death, if possible. Police have been trained in the past to walk over the injured to reach the attacker. Depending on the situation, they can quickly stop bleeding while advancing on the attacker, Butler said. \"You have to think of an active shooting as a military action. The casualties are essentially combat casualties,\" Butler said. More difficult is getting the message out to untrained civilians who could be in a position to stop bleeding during an attack. Butler hopes tourniquet use will eventually become a basic part of first-aid teaching like CPR and the Heimlich maneuver. \"It didn't happen overnight in the military and it isn't going to happen overnight in the civilian world, but we are doing everything we can to make sure it does happen,\" he said. 43 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jfCBJ5 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Wootson Jr. January 7 at 2:18 PM Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @CleveWootson Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary, live-tweeted from an attack at a Fort Lauderdale airport that left five dead. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) The tweets from Ari Fleischer started just before 1 p.m. Friday: \u201cI\u2019m at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired. Everyone is running.\u201d Fleischer, a White House press secretary\u00a0under President George W. Bush, had just stumbled into a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. Authorities say 26-year-old Esteban Santiago pulled a gun from his bag and opened fire in a baggage claim area. Five people were killed and six were injured by his bullets, investigators said, with dozens more injured in the chaotic scramble to escape. Around the same time, Fleischer had just gotten off a flight from New York. He only had a carry-on bag, but was headed down to baggage claim to meet a driver. He says nature\u2019s call may have saved his life. \u201cJust as I was leaving the bathroom, I heard tap-tap-tap, tap-tap, tap. Multiple gunshots ringing out,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd there was a small group of guys, we all stopped at the opening leading out to the area right above the escalator. We all realized it was gunfire and it was coming from the level below us at the escalator.\u201d \u201c\u2026 I would have been in the middle of it. It was right below me.\u201d Police said five people were killed in a shooting Friday afternoon at the Fort Lauderdale international airport that also sent others to the hospital. Officials said the suspect is in custody. (Thomas Johnson,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Fleischer and the other men didn\u2019t think they were out of danger yet. In fact, they were near one of the worst places for an active shooter situation \u2014 a bathroom with only one way out. If the gunman came up the escalator, they could be trapped. The area between the bathroom and an airport exit appeared clear. Fleischer said he told the group \u201c\ufffd?that\u2019s where we all need to go. \u2026And that way you can be out on the street and have multiple choices of which way to go.\u201d So he and the other men dashed across the open area. Abandoned luggage was strewn about. People were running away from the gunfire or huddled in a doorway. Fleischer had a view of the lower level, where the gunshots came from. \u201cThere was a trail of blood,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could follow the path of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked down and I could see one of the victims and he was bleeding profusely.\u201d Fleischer passed two police officers who were discussing details of the shooting: one shooter, five dead. Around that time, Fleischer\u00a0whipped out his phone and fired off three tweets over 24 minutes. I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired. Everyone is running. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017 The police said there is one shooter and five victims. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017 All seems calm now but the police aren't letting anyone out of the airport \u2013 at least not the area where I am. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017 He made contact with his driver, but the man was one of the witnesses being interviewed by police. So Fleischer left the terminal and tried to find a cab or another way out of the airport. [ Charleston church shooter: \ufffd?I would like to make it crystal clear, I do not regret what I did\u2019 ] He fired off more tweets before a reporter from the Daily Beast approached him and gave him a ride to his meeting. Fleischer worked for the Bush administrations from 2001 until 2003. He was Bush\u2019s spokesman during the Florida recount in 2000 and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He told The Post he was fine after Friday\u2019s near miss, although after he was safe, there was a reminder of how close he was to danger. \u201cA\u00a0young father with two toddlers came up to me and said he was walking right behind me earlier and he saw me veer off to go to the bathroom,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cHe went down the escalator and he got halfway down when he heard the shots. He said he grabbed his two toddlers under both his arms, turned around and ran up the down escalator. I had been 5 to 10 seconds in front of him before I veered off.\u201d This post has been updated.

Dan Coats as Director of National Intelligence By Jonathan Karl Jan 7, 2017, 10:29 AM ET 0 Shares Star Albin Lohr-Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images Sen. Daniel Coats pauses while speaking to the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, Nov. 30, 2016. =Albin Lohr-Jones/Pool via Bloomberg 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday morning that he will nominate former Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana to serve as Director of National Intelligence. \"I'm very confident that Senator Dan Coats is the right choice to serve as director of national intelligence,\" Trump said in statement. \"Dan has clearly demonstrated the deep subject matter expertise and sound judgment required to lead our intelligence community. If confirmed as director of national intelligence, he will provide unwavering leadership that the entire intelligence community can respect, and will spearhead my administration\u2019s ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm.\" ABC News reported on Thursday, citing senior Trump transition officials, that the announcement of Coats for the post was forthcoming. Coats, 73, made a visit to Trump Tower late last year and said at the time that he was not seeking a position in the Trump administration. The Republican was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee during his term, which ended this year after he decided not to seek re-election. He was also the U.S. ambassador to Germany under President George W. Bush. The announcement of his nomination comes as a senior Trump transition official tells ABC News that Trump and his team are mulling an overhaul of the national intelligence director's role, which Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that is not the case. The director of national intelligence office was created after 9/11 to coordinate the work of the nation\u2019s intelligence-gathering and analysis agencies. Trump clashed with U.S. intelligence agencies over the last several weeks over whether they were correct in their conclusion that Russia conducted cyberattacks to interfere with the U.S. election. On Friday, after receiving a briefing from intelligence officials on the alleged Russian hacking , the president-elect said it had been \"a constructive meeting\" and that he has \u201ctremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation.\" 0 Shares ",

They also said the beating started in a van when the same attacker became angry that the mother had contacted him asking that her son be allowed to come home. A prosecutor told the judge that the suspects forced the victim to drink toilet water, kiss the floor and then allegedly stuffed a sock into his mouth and taped it shut as they bound his hands with a belt. (Top, L-R): Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington (Bottom, L-R): Tanishia Covington, Tesfaye Cooper Chicago Police Department - AP The four are charged with two counts of committing a hate crime \u2014 one because of the victim's race and the other because of his mental disabilities. On the video, the male suspects use knives to cut the victim's hair and his sweatshirt. One of the females can be seen laughing. A female also laughs as she punches the victim. One of the men pulls the cord from the victim's sweatshirt around the victim's neck and holds him up while the victim groans in pain, according to a document read in court. The victim can be heard screaming when one of the men walks up to him with a knife and asks if he should \"shank\" him.

The four suspects were identified as Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Jordan Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as Covington's 24-year-old sister, Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago. They stood quietly as the prosecutor read the allegations. Some of their relatives also listened, including a woman who wiped tears from her eyes.

Cooper, for example, takes care of his twin brother, who is in a wheelchair. Tanishia Covington has two small children. Her sister attends college and has a job. Hill, the judge was told, goes to church with his grandmother. All four have experienced brushes with the law, some for serious and violent crimes. Hill, for example, was arrested as a juvenile in 2015 on allegations of armed robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and residential burglary. Chicago police said they did not know the disposition of those arrests by suburban officers. Tanishia Covington was arrested in 2007 on attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. Police records do not show any convictions as a juvenile. As an adult, she was arrested on charges of battery and aggravated assault, but those charges were dropped. The uproar over the beating intensified the glare on Chicago after a bloody year of violent crime and protests against Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a police department that has been accused of using excessive force and hushing-up wrongdoing. The department has also been the subject of a long civil-rights investigation by the Justice Department, which is expected to report its findings soon. The incident also stirred emotions still raw after a presidential campaign that split the nation. Some conservatives suggested it was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said there was no indication of any connection. The incident began New Year's Eve, when the victim and alleged assailant Jordan Hill met at a suburban McDonald's, and then called his parents later to say he was staying with Hill for a sleepover. Instead, Hill drove the victim around in a stolen van for a couple of days, ending up at a home in Chicago, where two of the other suspects lived, police said. The victim's parents reported him missing Monday evening, two days after last hearing from him. The victim eventually escaped and a police officer spotted him wandering down a street, bloodied and disoriented. Associated Press ",

    "text": "Reynolds, Fisher laid to rest at Hollywood Hills cemetery A look at actress Debbie Reynolds and her daughter, actress and author Carrie Fisher, through the years. Privacy Policy Carrie Fisher , who has been laid to rest alongside her mother Debbie Reynolds , was adored by family, friends and fans for her gallows humor and frank talk about her struggles with mental illness. What better home for her ashes then, her brother Todd Fisher and daughter Billie Lourd decided, than a porcelain urn in the shape of an outsized anti-depressant? MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR \"Carrie's favorite possession was a giant Prozac pill that she bought many years ago,\" Todd Fisher said Friday as he left the private joint funeral at Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills for his mother and sister. \"She loved it, and it was in her house, and Billie and I felt it was where she'd want to be,\" he said. Other than Carrie Fisher's cremation and unique urn, nearly no details were revealed about the ceremony, or about what form the two women's graves took. They'll have plenty of celebrity company at the sprawling, hillside cemetery just across the Los Angeles River from Warner Bros. and Disney studios, including Bette Davis, Lucille Ball, Dick Van Patten, Liberace and Florence Henderson. The funeral came a day after the two actresses were eulogized by family and close friends at a private memorial service at their neighboring homes in Coldwater Canyon, about 10 miles west. Fisher, who played Princess Leia in four \"Star Wars\" films, died at age 60 on Dec. 27. Reynolds , star of \"Singin' in the Rain\" and many other classic musicals, died a day later at age 84. Todd Fisher said Friday he'll remember his mother and sister most for their resilience, and said both reminded him of Reynold's role in 1964's \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown.\" \"They were both Molly Browns of sorts,\" Todd Fisher said. \"It's about a very strong woman. They were very, very strong women.\" He added, \"we have so much of them that was left behind, all my sister's words, and all the movies and all the things they created, and that's what we need to remember.\" Now, the family plans a public memorial. \"We'll have a bigger service down the road for the public and all the family friends, but this was a private family service,\" Todd Fisher said. \"It was fitting and it was beautiful.\" Associated Press ",

    "text": "CBS/AP January 7, 2017, 9:35 AM Donald Trump names former Sen. Dan Coats to be intelligence chief Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, speaks to reporters at Trump Tower Nov. 30, 2016, in New York City. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Email WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday named retired Sen. Dan Coats as national intelligence director, saying the former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee was the right person to lead the new administration\u2019s \u201cceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm.\u201d A senior transition offiical told CBS News of Coats\u2019 selection on Thursday, but the official announcement was made on Saturday morning. Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement came one day after the release of a declassified government report on Russian efforts to influence the presidential election . The report predicts Russia isn\u2019t done intruding in U.S. politics and policymaking. On Friday President-elect Donald Trump received a classified briefing on Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. An unclassified ... Mr. Trump wants to improve relations with Russia and repeatedly has denounced intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment that the Kremlin interfered in the election, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. But the report released Friday explicitly ties Russian President Vladimir Putin to the meddling and says Russia had a \u201cclear preference\u201d for Mr. Trump over Clinton. Coats, an Indiana Republican, will await Senate confirmation to head the office, which was created after the Sept. 11 attacks to improve coordination among U.S. spy and law enforcement agencies. Coats now finds himself in line to be at the center of an intelligence apparatus that the president-elect has publicly challenged. Mr. Trump said in an early morning statement that Coats \u201chas clearly demonstrated the deep subject matter expertise and sound judgment required to lead our intelligence community.\u201d He said Coats \u201cwill provide unwavering leadership that the entire intelligence community can respect, and will spearhead my administration\u2019s ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm.\u201d Douglas Ollivant, senior fellow at New America and former National Security Council director, joins \"CBS This Morning\" from Washington to discuss... Coats, in a statement released by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, said: \u201cThere is no higher priority than keeping America safe, and I will utilize every tool at my disposal to make that happen.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s team has been examining ways to restructure intelligence agencies as part of an effort to streamline operations and improve efficiency, but Coats\u2019 nomination could ease fears that Mr. Trump would push for a significant overhaul. Coats, 73, is a Capitol Hill veteran who served eight years in the House before moving to the Senate in 1989 to take Dan Quayle\u2019s place when Quayle became President George H.W. Bush\u2019s vice president. Coats stayed in the Senate until 1998, then left to become a lobbyist. Donald Trump chose former Indiana Sen. Dan Coats as his director of national intelligence Thursday even as he continues to publicly criticize the... After serving as U.S. ambassador to Germany under President George W. Bush, Coats joined the international law firm of King & Spalding, helping lead the government affairs division and lobbying for pharmaceutical, defense and energy companies. Coats, who earned $600,000 in his final 13 months at King & Spalding, downplayed his lobbying work when he returned to Indiana for a successful Senate comeback bid in 2010. He served one term and did not seek re-election last year. Coats was a vocal critic of Russia and pushed the Obama administration to harshly punish Moscow for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. When the White House levied sanctions, the Kremlin responded by banning several lawmakers, including Coats, from traveling to Russia. Mr. Trump received a briefing Friday from intelligence officials on the classified report about Russian interference in the 2016 election, and he later told The Associated Press that he \u201clearned a lot\u201d from the discussions. But the president-elect declined to say whether he accepted the officials\u2019 assertion that Russia had intruded in the election on his behalf. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Jan 4 2017, 3:11 pm ET The Hunt For Alien Megastructures Is On by Shannon Hall This artist's concept shows the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE spacecraft, in its orbit around Earth. NASA/JPL-Caltech Share advertisement Last year, a single star found fame. It consistently made headlines and even appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Late Night Show with Stephen Colbert.\" The star (often referred to as Tabby's star) is located 1,200 light-years away toward the constellation Cygnus and has been inexplicably flickering and fading by such large amounts that it cannot be easily explained by natural causes. One astronomer has speculated that it's encased within a vast alien megastructure , and although scientists have yet to solve that particular stellar mystery, they are continuing to scour the sky in search of these colossal construction projects \u2014 both within and beyond our home galaxy. Related: The 5 Biggest Questions About the Universe It might sound like science fiction, but as early as 1959 physicist Freeman Dyson surmised that all advanced civilizations \u2014 including ours \u2014 would eventually build one of these megastructures. He predicted that any civilization could wake up one day to discover that they had consumed all of the energy available on their home planet. At this point, each civilization would naturally look toward their stars, giant nuclear furnaces that release torrents of energy every second, for a solution. Unfortunately, only a sliver of that energy, in the form of light, will fall on any orbiting planet. Most is simply lost to space. So any advanced civilization would likely build a series of solar panels to envelope the star, almost like scaffolding around a church's dome, collecting every available scrap of the star's energy and beaming it back toward their home planet. Today these megastructures are better known as Dyson Spheres, and from an engineering perspective they sound pretty wild. It's true that a sphere which completely encloses a star is impractical (one asteroid strike or stellar flare and the entire shell would become unstable) \u2014 but a swarm of mirrors that orbit the star like bees buzzing around a hive, or a ring of mirrors that could look as majestic as the rings of Saturn are practical. They're so practical, in fact, that human beings already have most of the tools to build one.

In 2012, Armstrong proposed a simple scenario in which humanity could build a Dyson Sphere by mining Mercury for its materials. The process would ultimately destroy the innermost planet. Roughly half of Mercury's mass is oxygen and iron \u2014 elements that can be combined to form an iron oxide called hematite, which has been used to build mirrors since antiquity. So it would be relatively straightforward to mine Mercury for those materials, fabricate them into energy-collecting mirrors and jettison them into space. The solar power harnessed would then supply the power to continue mining the rocky planet \u2014 creating a positive loop that would allow us to strip more material with each passing year. Armstrong speculates that it would only take 30 years to tear Mercury to shreds and create a Dyson Sphere. \"We're on the edge of being able to expand across the universe ourselves,\" he says. Related: If Aliens Call, Does Humanity Have a Plan? Once we do, such a dramatic change in the solar system will easily be noticed by an alien observer. First, the distant Sun will grow dimmer as more and more solar panels cover it. Second, those panels will radiate waste heat, just like your computer grows warm when it's running, causing the Sun to glow more in the infrared. For this reason, not everyone thinks that Tabby's star is enshrouded within a Dyson Sphere. The visible dimming signature is odd and it doesn't show excess infrared light. \"It doesn't walk and talk like a Dyson Sphere,\" says Erik Zackrisson from Uppsala University in Sweden. But Tabby's star is only one star out of the 100 billion dotted across our galaxy. With plenty of other opportunities to find a Dyson Sphere, many astronomers have been on the hunt. In 2008, for example, Richard Carrigan, a physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, combed through the data from 250,000 astronomical sources found by the IRAS infrared satellite. (Launched in 1983, IRAS was the first space telescope to image the entire night sky and infrared wavelengths.) His team found a few objects within several hundred light-years of Earth that emanated more heat than one might suspect. So he turned the SETI Institute's Allen Array toward it to listen for radio signals, but found none. Other studies too have come up empty-handed. An illustration of a Dyson swarm, a variation on the Dyson sphere made up of independent constructs that orbit in dense formation around a star. Vedexent under CC-BY-2.5 License You might think that that's the end of the line, but a few astronomers actually think we could see a civilization in another galaxy \u2014 assuming that it has colonized the breadth of it. The idea is that the energy-hungry civilization would expand beyond its planetary system, overtaking the galaxy and encapsulating most of its stars within Dyson Spheres. This would drastically alter the light we receive from the galaxy and render its inhabitants visible. \"That's actually a really wacky idea,\" says James Annis, an astronomer at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. \"There's no good reason to expect an intelligent species to cover every star in the galaxy or even 99 percent of the stars in the galaxy. But if they did it, it would be a markedly visible thing.\" So as early as the late-90s, Annis searched the skies for galaxies that are darkened by so many Dyson Spheres. He didn't find any. \"I personally think that although most intelligent species will try to get out of their solar system, it's not at all obvious that they will cover every star in the galaxy in an attempt to extract all the energy the galaxy has to offer,\" Annis says. There are other astrophysical objects that harbor far more energy than stars. Take, for example, the supermassive black hole sitting at the centers of most massive galaxies. When these ravenous black holes gobble down gas and dust, they blaze light in the process. \"You have an object that is the size of a solar system that is as bright as a whole galaxy,\" Zackrisson says. \"If you can build a Dyson Sphere around that, then you would have an enormous amount of energy at your disposal.\" Perhaps the best method in searching for extragalactic civilizations is to search for Dyson Spheres around supermassive black holes, or any high-energy astrophysical object. This is why Annis thinks Jason Wright's latest study is brilliant. Wright, of Penn State University, examined some 100,000 nearby large galaxies in the all-sky catalog from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Although WISE is similar to IRAS in that they both imaged the entire sky in the infrared, WISE did so with 1,000 times better sensitivity. Wright and his team looked for galaxies that were bright in the mid-infrared \u2014 the expected signature from heat-emitting Dyson Spheres \u2014 but didn't correlate that information with galaxies that were dim in the visible \u2014 meaning that these Dyson Spheres didn't have to enshroud stars, but could enshroud anything. They don't even have to be Dyson Spheres, just some alien-made object that emits excess heat. NASA's Kepler and Spitzer space telescopes suggest that its unusual light signals are likely from dusty comet fragments, which blocked the light of the star as they passed in front of it in 2011 and 2013. JPL-Caltech / NASA Unfortunately, Wright's team didn't find a single galaxy that contains any obvious signs of highly advanced technological civilizations. Before you jump to any conclusions about our cosmic loneliness, know that the hunt is far from over. Zackrisson is currently digging through the first release from the Gaia spacecraft, which was launched in 2013 in order to pinpoint the positions of one billion stars on the sky to an accuracy that's hundreds of times better than today's catalog. By comparing the distances calculated by Gaia and those calculated based on a star's brightness alone, Zackrisson will be able to find stars that appear darker than typical. He's already discovered a handful. Annis too has many ideas for future projects, including one where he'd like to look at each and every star within the Large Magellanic Cloud, the brightest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Related: Why Space Miner's Are the Universe's Future Tycoons Armstrong, on the other hand, is ready to conclude that most of the galaxies in the universe (if not all) are empty. He thinks that just as advanced civilizations can easily build Dyson Spheres, they can easily colonize their galaxies, traversing the voids between stars at nearly the speed of light, and even reaching other galaxies, making their way from one end of the universe to the other. If extraterrestrial life were abundant, we should have come face to face with it (or at least the probes they sent out) on multiple occasions. The fact that we haven't likely means extraterrestrial life doesn't exist. So while most astronomers remain agnostic about the question, even hopeful, Armstrong thinks that we just might be \"the last hope for life in the cosmos.\" For more of the breakthroughs changing our lives, follow NBC MACH.

Charles Sykes/AP hide caption toggle caption Om Puri at the New York premiere of The Hundred-Foot Journey on Aug. 4, 2014. Charles Sykes/AP Prolific Indian actor Om Puri, who for decades appeared in films all over the world, has died at age 66 in Mumbai. Reports say Puri suffered a heart attack at his home early on Friday. Puri had roles in more than 300 movies in his career, NPR's Rose Friedman reports for our Newscast unit. Rose says he began acting in Indian art house cinema in the 1970s and soon branched into British and American films, including Gandhi in 1982 and Charlie Wilson's War in 2007. He appeared in the 2013 film The Reluctant Fundamentalist, in which he played a father struggling to pass on a sense of empathy to his Wall Street-employed son. Most recently, he starred alongside Helen Mirren in The Hundred-Foot Journey, a 2015 film about a displaced Indian family that settles in a French village and opens a restaurant. Puri was a crossover star, as evidenced by the breadth of people mourning his death. The BBC reported that even media in Pakistan, with whom India's relationship is often tense, are celebrating his life and career. The BBC wrote, \"[Puri] had recently spoken out against the ban imposed by India on Pakistani actors working in Bollywood films, following tensions over Kashmir,\" telling an Indian TV channel, \"Pakistani artists are not terrorists.\" Article continues after sponsorship In 2004, Puri received an honorary Order of the British Empire, an award established by King George V and given to individuals who have made distinguished contributions in their field. In 1990, he was awarded the Padma Shri , one of India's highest civilian honors, the Guardian wrote. Puri's professional life was wildly successful, but his personal life had been turbulent in recent years. He separated from his wife, Nandita, after she wrote his biography in 2009, called Unlikely Hero: Om Puri . The book revealed explicit details about his sexual forays as a young man. Puri is survived by Nandita, whom he married in 1993, and their son. Less than a month before his death, Puri took to Twitter to reflect on his life and career: I have no regrets at all. I have done quite well for myself. I didn't have a conventional face, but I have done well, and I am proud of it. ",

    "text": "Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person By ALAIN de BOTTON Photo Credit Marion Fayolle IT\u2019S one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us. We go to great lengths to avoid it. And yet we do it all the same: We marry the wrong person. Partly, it\u2019s because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others. We seem normal only to those who don\u2019t know us very well. In a wiser, more self-aware society than our own, a standard question on any early dinner date would be: \u201cAnd how are you crazy?\u201d Perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us or can relax only when we are working; perhaps we\u2019re tricky about intimacy after sex or clam up in response to humiliation. Nobody\u2019s perfect. The problem is that before marriage, we rarely delve into our complexities. Whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws, we blame our partners and call it a day. As for our friends, they don\u2019t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us. One of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with. Our partners are no more self-aware. Naturally, we make a stab at trying to understand them. We visit their families. We look at their photos, we meet their college friends. All this contributes to a sense that we\u2019ve done our homework. We haven\u2019t. Marriage ends up as a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don\u2019t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating. Continue reading the main story For most of recorded history, people married for logical sorts of reasons: because her parcel of land adjoined yours, his family had a flourishing business, her father was the magistrate in town, there was a castle to keep up, or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation of a holy text. And from such reasonable marriages, there flowed loneliness, infidelity, abuse, hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors. The marriage of reason was not, in hindsight, reasonable at all; it was often expedient, narrow-minded, snobbish and exploitative. That is why what has replaced it \u2014 the marriage of feeling \u2014 has largely been spared the need to account for itself. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What matters in the marriage of feeling is that two people are drawn to each other by an overwhelming instinct and know in their hearts that it is right. Indeed, the more imprudent a marriage appears (perhaps it\u2019s been only six months since they met; one of them has no job or both are barely out of their teens), the safer it can feel. Recklessness is taken as a counterweight to all the errors of reason, that catalyst of misery, that accountant\u2019s demand. The prestige of instinct is the traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable reason. But though we believe ourselves to be seeking happiness in marriage, it isn\u2019t that simple. What we really seek is familiarity \u2014 which may well complicate any plans we might have had for happiness. We are looking to recreate, within our adult relationships, the feelings we knew so well in childhood. The love most of us will have tasted early on was often confused with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent\u2019s warmth or scared of his anger, of not feeling secure enough to communicate our wishes. How logical, then, that we should as grown-ups find ourselves rejecting certain candidates for marriage not because they are wrong but because they are too right \u2014 too balanced, mature, understanding and reliable \u2014 given that in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign. We marry the wrong people because we don\u2019t associate being loved with feeling happy. We make mistakes, too, because we are so lonely. No one can be in an optimal frame of mind to choose a partner when remaining single feels unbearable. We have to be wholly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to be appropriately picky; otherwise, we risk loving no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us that fate. Finally, we marry to make a nice feeling permanent. We imagine that marriage will help us to bottle the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us: Perhaps we were in Venice, on the lagoon, in a motorboat, with the evening sun throwing glitter across the sea, chatting about aspects of our souls no one ever seemed to have grasped before, with the prospect of dinner in a risotto place a little later. We married to make such sensations permanent but failed to see that there was no solid connection between these feelings and the institution of marriage. Indeed, marriage tends decisively to move us onto another, very different and more administrative plane, which perhaps unfolds in a suburban house, with a long commute and maddening children who kill the passion from which they emerged. The only ingredient in common is the partner. And that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle. The good news is that it doesn\u2019t matter if we find we have married the wrong person. We mustn\u2019t abandon him or her, only the founding Romantic idea upon which the Western understanding of marriage has been based the last 250 years: that a perfect being exists who can meet all our needs and satisfy our every yearning. We need to swap the Romantic view for a tragic (and at points comedic) awareness that every human will frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us \u2014 and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. But none of this is unusual or grounds for divorce. Choosing whom to commit ourselves to is merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for. This philosophy of pessimism offers a solution to a lot of distress and agitation around marriage. It might sound odd, but pessimism relieves the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon marriage. The failure of one particular partner to save us from our grief and melancholy is not an argument against that person and no sign that a union deserves to fail or be upgraded. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste (he or she doesn\u2019t exist), but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently \u2014 the person who is good at disagreement. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate differences with generosity that is the true marker of the \u201cnot overly wrong\u201d person. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it must not be its precondition.

Officials say he reached out to the FBI in November and told them that the Islamic State had taken control of his mind. USA TODAY NETWORK Passengers wait in line at Terminal 4 of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport after the facility reopened at 5:00 a.m Saturday, the day after a gunman opened fire at the airport. (Photo: Mike Stocker, AP) Authorities on Saturday filed charges that carry a potential death penalty\u00a0as they\u00a0 continue\u00a0to hunt for a\u00a0motive behind the deadly shooting rampage\u00a0at\u00a0Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International\u00a0Airport. Five were killed and six injured in the Friday chaos.\u00a0The suspect\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who had previously told\u00a0the FBI that intelligence agencies controlled his mind and urged him to fight for the Islamic State \u2014 was apprehended by police without incident. Here's what we know: What happened? The melee erupted\u00a0around 1 p.m. ET, when\u00a0a man opened fire\u00a0in\u00a0a baggage claim area in Terminal 2.\u00a0Witnesses\u00a0described him\u00a0as slender, 5-foot-7 and\u00a0wearing\u00a0a\u00a0blue T-shirt.\u00a0He did not say a word as he emptied several magazines of bullets, the witnesses said. He then dropped to the floor, spread-eagled, and\u00a0awaited arrest. Broward County Commissioner\u00a0Chip LaMarca said the gun came from the killer's\u00a0checked bag. After retrieving the bag,\u00a0he went to the bathroom, loaded the firearm and started shooting, LaMarca tweeted . George Piro,\u00a0FBI\u00a0special agent in charge of the agency's Miami division, said authorities have interviewed 175 witnesses and collected\u00a0photos, video and other physical evidence. This is a fluid situation. 5 dead. 8 initially injured. 37 others injured after incident. All injured taken to BHMC & Memorial Regional. \u2014 Broward Sheriff (@browardsheriff) January 7, 2017 Who is the suspect? Esteban Santiago,\u00a026, a former  military veteran, has been identified as the suspect by law enforcement authorities. They\u00a0say\u00a0he appears to have acted alone. Santiago was taken into custody without incident by a Broward County sheriff's deputy. He was booked at a Broward County jail on a murder charge. On Saturday, federal authorities\u00a0with the U.S. attorney's office in\u00a0Miami\u00a0charged\u00a0Santiago of an act of violence at an international airport resulting in death. He was also charged with two firearms offenses. The charges could bring the\u00a0death penalty upon a conviction. \"Indications are that he came here to carry out this horrific attack. We have not identified any triggers that would've caused this attack,\" Piro said. \"We are continuing to look at the terrorism angle as a potential motivation.\" Born in New Jersey, Santiago served in both the Puerto Rico National Guard and the\u00a0Alaska Army National Guard, according to Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, director of public affairs for the Alaska National Guard. Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale early Friday aboard a Delta flight that originated Thursday. x Share 5 KILLED, 6 INJURED IN FORT LAUDERDALE AIRPORT SHOOTINGFla.

The FBI conducted a background check, learning of his military record, which included service in Iraq, but found no connection to terror groups. Determining that the man apparently needed psychiatric care, the FBI alerted local law enforcement and turned him over to their custody for a medical referral.\u00a0It is not clear whether Santiago received treatment following that incident. The names of these slain victims have been made public\u00a0so far: \u25ba\u00a0Olga Woltering of Georgia.\u00a0She was a member\u00a0of the Atlanta-area Catholic Church of the Transfiguration in Cobb County, according to an Associated Pres report.\u00a0Woltering and her husband flew to Fort Lauderdale for a cruise, church sources\u00a0said. The Oceana Volunteer Fire Department posted this photo of Terry Andres on its Facebook page. \u00a0(Photo: Facebook photo) \u25ba\u00a0Terry Andres, of Virginia. He was a volunteer support technician with the Oceana Volunteer Fire Department from April 2004 through 2010, said Art Kohn, spokesman for the Virginia Beach Fire Department. \u25ba\u00a0Michael Oehme, 57, of Iowa, has been identified as one of the slain victims by his sister. Elizabeth Oehme-Miller also told the AP\u00a0by phone Saturday that her brother's wife, 52-year-old Kari Oehme, was shot in the shoulder and is expected to recover. They flew to Fort Lauderdale to go on a cruise, she said. Others' names will be released\u00a0later. The number of injured was revised Saturday from\u00a0eight to six. Three of the victims are in good condition and the others are in intensive care. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Saturday morning that some of the survivors\u00a0are \u201cfighting for their lives.\" Scott said he visited some of the victims in the hospital Friday evening. He talked to a couple who\u00a0flew to Fort Lauderdale\u00a0to go on a cruise. The wife was shot, and now they'll be going home instead.\u00a0Another woman's husband was shot and was bleeding \"profusely\" form the arm, Scott said. The shooting, Scott said, was a \"hateful act.\" \u201cIt was an absolutely horrific day,\u201d he added. \u201cThe person responsible for this act will be brought to justice to the furthest extent of the law.\u201d Volunteer firefighter, frequent traveler among Florida airport victims How did\u00a0a gun get through a checked bag? Transportation Security Administration rules \u00a0allow travelers to pack unloaded firearms in checked luggage, so long as passengers declare their weapons\u00a0to the airline while checking in, and they are packed in a locked, hard-sided container. Piro said Santiago followed TSA procedures by checking the weapon. The\u00a0 strict protocols involve showing the weapon \u00a0and its carrying case to an airline ticket agent, who then checks that the gun is unloaded. Ammunition may also be carried in checked baggage but must be stored separately from the gun, said\u00a0David Williams, assistant professor of aerospace and occupational safety at\u00a0 Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University \u00a0in\u00a0Daytona Beach, Fla. If the high-tech baggage screening behind the scenes detects a gun that hasn't been declared, \"that gun will be set aside. It will not get on the airplane. And, a law enforcement officer will find and arrest you,\" Williams said. \u00a0 Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

By Chico Harlan , Sari Horwitz and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. January 7 at 9:08 PM Follow @chicoharlan Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @CleveWootson Police said five people were killed in a shooting Friday afternoon at the Fort Lauderdale international airport that also sent others to the hospital. Officials said the suspect is in custody. (Thomas Johnson,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) The suspected gunman in an airport shooting rampage in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u2014 Esteban Santiago, 26, an Iraq War veteran \u2014\u00a0has been charged with federal crimes and could face the death penalty, the Justice Department announced Saturday night. Santiago showed signs of violence and what authorities called \u201cerratic behavior\u201d in the months before they said he traveled 4,000 miles from home, loaded a gun in a baggage area and killed five people in some 80 seconds. Investigators said Saturday that\u00a0Santiago drew frequent police attention for domestic violence in his Alaska home town and twice was arrested within the last year. Two months before the shooting, they said, he was admitted to a mental-health facility after showing up at an FBI field office and telling agents his mind was being controlled, complaining that the government was forcing him to watch Islamic State videos. Police held his gun for a month, and then gave it back to him, authorities said. Those sporadic run-ins now raise questions about how Santiago evaded detection as he boarding two flights \u2014 checking in a weapon \u2014 before he landed at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and allegedly fired at\u00a0unsuspecting travelers. Investigators said they were still trying to determine if there was a terrorism motive. A day after the shooting, agents had interviewed more than 100 people, including Santiago, who surrendered after firing all of his ammunition by dropping onto the floor, spread-eagle, near a baggage area when a sheriff\u2019s deputy approached him, according to an FBI affidavit. Investigators are scouring Santiago\u2019s electronics and digital media, said a\u00a0law enforcement official familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity, trying to determine whether he had any real contact with Islamic State sympathizers and whether that motivated him to carry out the shooting. \u201cWe have not ruled out anything,\u201d George L. Piro, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau\u2019s Miami division, said Saturday morning at a briefing. \u201cWe continue to look at all avenues, all motives for this attack. And we continue to look at the terrorism aspect as a motive.\u201d [ How the Fort Lauderdale shooting suspect was able to get a gun past airport security \u2014 legally ] The bloody rampage sent people scrambling through the terminals and across the airfield at one of the country\u2019s busiest airports, shutting down all flights for hours as paramedics and federal and local law enforcement officers flooded the scene. Six were injured in the shooting, and dozens more were hurt in the chaos that followed. Santiago was placed in federal custody Saturday morning following a lengthy interview by Broward County Sheriff\u2019s deputies and FBI agents. The federal charges against him are: performing an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation that caused serious bodily injury; using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence; and causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm. [ U.S. airports urge vigilance in aftermath of shooting at Fort Lauderdale airport ] The FBI is leading a sprawling investigation that spans from Florida to Alaska. Names of the victims have not yet been released, because not all families have been notified. The Associated Press reported that at least four of the five were vacationers picking up their bags before going to board cruise ships. Santiago is believed to have lived most recently in Anchorage with a girlfriend and a young child.\u00a0 Neighbors said two other children also lived at the house. Local police and FBI officials in a Saturday news conference described his life as chaotic, with frequent police run-ins. At least four times in 2016, police were called to Santiago\u2019s house for physical disturbances or domestic violence. It is unclear who made those calls. In one case, he appears to have taken a plea deal and, in exchange for compliance with its terms, the charges were dismissed. When he showed up in November at the local FBI office, he had a newborn and a weapon in the car, said Anchorage police chief Chris Tolley. But in an interview at the time with the FBI, Santiago stated that \u201che did not wish to harm anyone,\u201d said Marlin Ritzman, special agent in charge of the FBI Anchorage field office. \u201cOur agents contacted local authorities who took custody of Mr. Santiago and transported him to a local mental-health facility for evaluation,\u201d Ritzman said. The FBI interviewed his family members, conducted database reviews and interagency checks, and ultimately closed what it termed an \u201cassessment\u201d of Santiago. Santiago\u2019s weapon was logged \u201cfor safekeeping,\u201d Tolley said. But one month later, the weapon was released to him. Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale on Friday after flying from Anchorage, with a layover in Minneapolis. He traveled alone and checked a single bag \u2014 one that contained his firearm, said Jesse Davis, chief of police at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where passengers routinely check their weapons. \u201cWe\u2019re a big hunting state, so we get quite a lot of that,\u201d Davis said. Travelers are allowed to bring firearms with them onto flights as long as the guns are unloaded, locked in a hard-sided container and in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Ammunition can be brought onto flights but also must be placed in checked baggage. \u201cEverything appeared normal,\u201d Davis said. Santiago checked in for his Delta flight more than four hours early, which was unusual, Davis said, but \u201cdidn\u2019t call attention to himself at all.\u201d In Fort Lauderdale, at the Terminal 2 baggage claim, Santiago picked up his bag from the carousel, went to the bathroom and loaded his Walther 9mm semiautomatic handgun, federal officials said. When he came out, he began firing, shooting the first people he encountered, according to an FBI affidavit. [ \u2018There was a trail of blood\u2019: Ari Fleischer was nearly caught in the Fort Lauderdale shooting ] Mario Andrade, a driver from Carey Limousine, was waiting for his customer, Ari Fleischer, who was White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, near the bottom of the escalator in the Delta baggage area of Terminal 2. He was holding a sign with Fleischer\u2019s last name and talking on the phone with another driver. Fleischer\u2019s 12:15 p.m. flight was late and it was nearly 1 p.m. Then, Andrade heard\u00a0gunfire. \u201cIt was very fast, like tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat,\u201d Andrade said. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh my God, someone is shooting!\u2019 \u201d He said that he immediately dropped to the floor, people were running and he heard screaming all around him. Andrade said he looked up and saw a man in a blue shirt who had a gun in his hand. The gunman, he said, began walking slowly toward him and had a \u201csurprised look\u201d on his face, \u201clike, Oh my God, what happened?\u2019 \u201d Relatives told news outlets that Santiago\u00a0had\u00a0a history of mental-health problems, including some that followed his military service in Iraq with the Puerto Rico National Guard. \u201cOnly thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn\u2019t feeling too good,\u201d his uncle, Hernan Rivera, told Newark\u2019s Star-Ledger\u00a0newspaper . His aunt told the newspaper he was hospitalized after returning from Iraq. \u201cHe lost his mind,\u201d Ruiz Rivera said in Spanish. He had seemed to get the help he needed, and became a father in September, she told Noticias Telemundo. But his mental health-issues, she said, worsened in December.\u00a0\u201cThey took him to the hospital, but they didn\u2019t tell me what for, but they had him in an isolated room because he was a little wrong in the head and he started to like hear things,\u201d she said. George Piro, FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Miami division, told reporters at a news conference on Jan. 7 that they they've concluded their interview with Esteban Santiago, the suspect in the rampage at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. (Reuters) The airport reopened Saturday morning for flights, officials said, though they warned that some flights were canceled or rerouted in the wake of Friday\u2019s violence. Some travelers were also being directed other two major airports in Miami and West Palm Beach.

Stringer/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Stringer/AFP/Getty Images An image grab taken from an AFPTV video released on Saturday shows people gathering amidst at the site of a car bomb attack in the rebel-held town of Azaz in northern Syria. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images A blast has torn through the Syrian town of Azaz, killing at least 43 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The U.K.-based activist group says the explosion was caused by a fuel tanker rigged with a bomb, which went off outside a courthouse in the rebel-held town on Syria's border with Turkey. Reuters reports that Turkey's state-run Andalou news service puts the death toll even higher, quoting a doctor who says at least 60 people have been killed and more than 50 have been wounded. Most of the victims of the car bomb were civilians, the Observatory says. The Associated Press describes the scene of the explosion: \"Images shared online showed a huge plume of black smoke rising above the chaotic market and sounds of gunfire echoing in the background as onlookers gathered around the site. Bodies were strewn on the ground as a father ran away from the scene hugging his child.\" No group has immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, though the BBC reports that the Islamic State has been blamed. Article continues after sponsorship The violence comes just over a week after Turkey and Russia brokered a cease-fire in the civil war-ravaged country. Since then, violence has ebbed, but rebel factions have protested what they call breaches of the agreement by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. They have suspended their preparations for the peace talks planned for later this month, throwing those negotiations into doubt. Syrian Rebel Factions Say They're Freezing Participation In Peace Talks The Free Syrian Army, a rebel group backed by the Turkish government, controls Azaz, which lies less than five miles from the border. According to Al-Jazeera , the town has been racked by violence in recent months \u2014 including a November attack on rebel headquarters that killed 25 people, and another attack in October that killed at least 20 people. Just across the border, Turkey has seen its own share of the region's violence recently. Last year, a suicide bombing in the nearby Turkish city of Gaziantep claimed the lives of at least 66 people outside a wedding. Turkish officials said that ISIS was responsible for that attack. ",

(Connecticut State Police) Connecticut state police responded Saturday to reports of a nearly 30-vehicle pileup on a highway near Hartford. A snowstorm that was predicted to bring up to 8 inches of snow to the area was being blamed for the crash at exit 21 in the southbound lanes of I-91 in Middletown. Police said no one was seriously injured. The pileup involved at least 20 cars, three tractor-trailers and a tanker. I-91 was shut in both directions from exit 20 to exit 25 after the accident, MassLive.com reported. Police snapped photos of the crash aftermath and posted them on Facebook and Twitter. In Virginia, authorities say slick roads have caused more than 500 crashes, including one that was fatal. State Police Spokeswoman Corinne Geller said a man's SUV struck another vehicle, then ran off the road and overturned in a creek. The snow has moved out of Virginia, but police say driving conditions remain dangerous and are encouraging people to stay off the roads. Winter weather and potentially dangerous road conditions led officials to postpone the men's college basketball game between 14th-ranked North Carolina and North Carolina State that was scheduled for Saturday night. Up to 8 inches of snow were expected in parts of Connecticut, but areas along the southeastern Massachusetts coast could get 1 to 2 feet before the storm moves away later Saturday. Blizzard conditions were reported on Cape Cod and Plymouth County. Officials warned people to stay off the roads as the heavy snow and gusty winds were expected to reduce visibility to near zero. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care, or even over individual income taxes. But the consequences for business \u2014 and for the long-term trajectory of the economy \u2014 are huge. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The basic idea behind a D.B.C.F.T. (to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter) is this: Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States. But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden, and those tricks distort the economy. Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a company\u2019s legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes. Moreover, because interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible, even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along. The House Republicans\u2019 approach, instead of taxing the easy-to-manipulate corporate income, goes after a firm\u2019s domestic cash flow: money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth. There\u2019s no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because you\u2019ll be taxed on things you sell in the United States, regardless. \u201cWith an income tax, one of the key issues is \u2018how do you measure income,\u2019 \u201d said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a leading advocate of the idea. \u201cBut with cash flow you just follow the money.\u201d And the tax, Mr. Auerbach argues, could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt. It allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time. And it doesn\u2019t give favorable treatment to debt, as opposed to equity. Photo Major retailers who sell imported goods, like Walmart, are potential losers in a move toward a cash-flow-based corporate income tax. Credit Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times That alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system. Congressional staff members, the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal: how it might be phased in, and how to treat financial services, and much more. Some of the most complex, and politically problematic, elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade, which creates winners and losers. And some of those potential losers are powerful. Consider what border adjustment means: When an American company exports goods under this new tax system, it would not pay any taxes on its international sales, while its imports would be taxed. So a company that spent $80 making something that it sold overseas for $100 would pay no tax on its earnings. A company that imported goods worth $80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for $100 would pay tax on the full $100. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit. Indeed, it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this. Many economists think it won\u2019t work that way, however. That\u2019s because as soon as a cash-flow-based tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law, the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets. And that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent pro-export, anti-import effects of the tax. The dollar could rise by, say, 20 to 25 percent, and the trade balance could remain about where it started. Essentially, moving to this system means betting on a \u201ctextbook economic theory,\u201d as analysts at Evercore ISI put it, becoming a reality even though the effect hasn\u2019t been tested in practice. If the dollar doesn\u2019t strengthen as expected, for example, import-dependent industries, especially those with lean profit margins, could face disaster. That helps explain why some of the stiffest opposition to this tax overhaul is coming from the retail industry . Essentially, economists are telling them \u201ctrust us, our models say the currency will adjust and it will all come out in the wash,\u201d but if the models are wrong, for companies like Walmart, Target and many others that sell large volumes of imported goods, their viability could be threatened. If the models turn out to be right, there is a different set of risks. The United States dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system, and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects. Many companies worldwide, especially banks and especially in emerging markets, have debt denominated in dollars, which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation. A big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from American investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the United States. As Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has noted, we don\u2019t really know what the distributional consequences of this tax overhaul would be. It could increase the costs of imported goods that the poor spend a disproportionate portion of their income on, like clothing and gasoline. That would be bad news for poorer Americans even as it makes the overall economy more efficient. There\u2019s still a lot of work to be done to understand the far-reaching consequences of the D.B.C.F.T. (also, work to be done to find a catchier name). But there\u2019s a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform. The benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly; these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly. No matter the outcome, 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system \u2014 with long-lasting economic consequences \u2014 will be up for grabs.

(AP Photo/Paul Beaty File) 0 Shares Email Thousands of people waited for hours in single-digit temperatures on Saturday to try to get a ticket to President Barack Obama's farewell speech in his hometown of Chicago, saying they want to show their appreciation and soak in the final moments of his history-making presidency. People began lining up well before sunrise for the 8 a.m. ticket distribution. The lines stretched for blocks and snarled traffic around McCormick Place, the sprawling convention center along Lake Michigan where Obama will speak on Tuesday night. \"You never know when something as huge or as phenomenal like this will happen again, so I was like 'I'm not missing this for nothing,'\" said Umar Ibrahim, 28, who took the day off from his job as a city bus driver to snag a ticket, waking up at 3 a.m. to start the trek to the convention center. \"Just talking about it makes you beam,\" he said as he clenched his ticket, grinning from ear-to-ear. Obama's final speech to the public will continue a tradition set in 1796 when George Washington addressed the American people for the last time as president. It will be followed by a \"family reunion\" for alumni of Obama's former campaigns, according to a save-the-date sent to alumni. Obama has described the event as \"a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey,\" to celebrate the ways the country has changed and \"to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.\" For many supporters, Obama's decision to give the speech in Chicago rather than Washington added to the significance of the event. It was in Chicago's Grant Park that in 2008 he delivered his victory speech after becoming the nation's first black president. \"He's coming home,\" said Cheryl Bellamy-Bonner, 56, who volunteered on Obama's 2004 U.S. Senate campaign. \"It shows he really cares about the people.\" Bellamy-Bonner said she appreciated Obama's professionalism in office and his support of diversity. If there have been any disappointments, she said, it's that he couldn't accomplish more, which she blamed on a lack of bipartisanship. On Tuesday night, she's hoping to hear what Obama will do next and \"what we can do to help.\" Organizers didn't say how many tickets were available, but many people walked away empty-handed on Saturday. Among them was Stacy Bond. The 28-year-old from suburban Evanston said she's disheartened about President-elect Donald Trump and wanted to be in the room to hear directly from Obama, the first president she voted for after reaching the legal voting age. \"You kind of want to hold on to that last bit of him that we've had,\" she said. The White House says the farewell address also will be streamed live online. Obama will be joined by first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden . \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Sara Burnett on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sara\u2014burnett 0 Shares ",

Officials say he reached out to the FBI in November and told them that the Islamic State had taken control of his mind. USA TODAY NETWORK This booking photo provided by the Broward Sheriff's Office shows suspect Esteban Santiago, 26, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Relatives of the man who police say opened fire Friday killing several people and wounding others at Fort Lauderdale airport report that he had a history of mental health issues. (Photo: Broward Sheriff's Office, AP) Federal\u00a0prosecutors late Saturday\u00a0filed charges\u00a0against a man accused of going\u00a0on a shooting rampage at a Florida airport that killed five people. The charges could bring the death penalty if he is convicted.\u00a0 The Miami U.S. attorney's office accused Esteban Santiago of an act of violence at an international airport resulting in death. He was also charged with two firearms offenses. Earlier Saturday, the FBI said Santiago flew to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport\u00a0specifically to carry out the attack, but his motive remains unclear. Federal authorities, who concluded\u00a0their interview\u00a0with Santiago\u00a0early Saturday, said they have not ruled out terrorism in the attack Friday but believe he acted alone. \"Indications are that he came here to carry out this horrific act,\" said George Piro, special agent in charge of the Miami office. \"We have not identified any triggers that would've caused this attack.\" He also said it was unclear why the shooter would have picked the Florida airport for the rampage. Share Fla. Governor Rick Scott speaks at the Fort Lauderdale - Hollywood International Airport Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq veteran, was\u00a0taken into custody only seconds after the melee ended at\u00a0the baggage claim area of Terminal 2. Witnesses said the shooter reloaded at least twice, then dropped to the floor spread-eagle and waited to be arrested after running out of ammunition. Broward County Sheriff Steve Israel on Saturday revised downward the\u00a0number of people wounded in the incident\u00a0from eight to six, including three people being treated in intensive care and three listed in good condition. Piro said Santiago was cooperative during\u00a0interviews with investigators and was\u00a0booked on\u00a0federal murder charges at the Broward County jail. Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale early Friday aboard a Delta flight that originated Thursday. Piro said\u00a0Santiago allegedly retrieved his 9mm automatic handgun that he had packed in\u00a0checked luggage\u00a0and opened fire on passengers around a baggage carousel. He said investigators were looking at video to get a clear picture of how the shooting unfolded\u00a0and whether any other person might have helped the gunman. \"We are continuing to look at the terrorism angle as a potential motivation,\" Piro said. \"At this point, it appears he acted alone.\" He added\u00a0it appeared the suspect followed federal procedures in checking in the weapon before boarding his original flight. Piro\u00a0also\u00a0said authorities have\u00a0conducted more than 100 interviews in connection with the case and have\u00a0confiscated evidence, including cellphones and laptops. Authorities in Alaska who last year referred Santiago for mental evaluation said\u00a0Saturday he was allowed to retrieve his gun in early December.\u00a0Santiago\u00a0could not be denied his weapon because he was not declared \"adjudicated mentally ill,\" Alaska U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler said during a press conference. Federal law prohibits the mentally ill from possessing weapons, but only if they've been formally declared adjudicated. In November, the suspect appeared unannounced in the FBI offices in Anchorage, complaining that the Islamic State had gained control of his mind and was urging him to fight on its behalf, a federal law enforcement official not authorized to speak publicly about the incident told USA TODAY. \"His erratic behavior concerned FBI agents,\" Piro said. The FBI conducted a background check, learning of his military record, which included service in Iraq, but found no connection to terror groups. Determining that the man apparently needed psychiatric care, the FBI alerted local law enforcement and turned him over to their custody for a medical referral.\u00a0It is not clear whether Santiago received treatment following that incident.

Three of the five victims of a lone gunman's rampage flew into Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from out of state, bound for Caribbean cruise ships with their spouses. Related: Suspected Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooter Charged, Faces Possible Death Penalty But their sailing getaways turned tragic when a gunman opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, randomly killing his targets and wounding another six people at a baggage claim, officials and witnesses said. The FBI said officials would only provide names of victims after relatives were contacted, although family members and loved ones have been releasing them. The victims are identified as: Olga Woltering, 84 Woltering, of Marietta, Georgia, was going on a cruise as a special treat for her husband, Ralph, who was celebrating his 90th birthday, according to Bruce Publicover, a deacon and family friend. Bruce Woltering survived the shooting. \"It was, 'Hey, we're gonna have some fun,' and they were cruise people,\" Publicover told NBC News about the couple's plans. Olga Wolteringwith her husband in an undated family photo. Courtesy of family The Wolterings were originally from England and had been married for over 60 years, Publicover said. They were also longtime members of their local Catholic church, always sitting in the front row during services. \"I think that they were the most lovely couple south of the Mason-Dixon line,\" he said. \"They're truly in love ... and if anybody exhibited youthful love in a mature senior setting, they did.\" The couple had two sons. One of them, Tim Woltering, told NBC News that his mother was a \"loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and good friend to many ... she remains in our hearts, thoughts, and memories forever.\" Publicover said they would be supporting Ralph Woltering, who lost his \"beautiful angel\" and wife with whom he was \"so perfectly paired.\" \"We're going to watch out for him like he was our own dad, our own brother, and try to help the best we can,\" he added. Terry Andres, 62 Andres, of Norfolk, Virginia, was going on a cruise with his wife, Ann, and was set to celebrate his birthday later this month, his daughter told NBC affiliate WAVY . She was not physically harmed. Terry Andres, 62, of Virginia Beach, Va., was going on a 16-day cruise with his wife when he was killed Friday. Courtesy of Andres family Andres was an employee at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, The Virginian-Pilot reported, and was a support technician volunteer with the Oceana Volunteer Fire Department since 2004. \"He was well liked and respected for both his dedication to being a volunteer as well as his professional approach to his job as a support tech,\" the department said in a statement. \"We mourn his passing as we do all the victims of the senseless attack in Ft. Lauderdale.\" Ryan Kim, Andres' daughter, told The Palm Beach Post that her father texted upon landing in Fort Lauderdale for their 16-day cruise. She added that she was in disbelief that her father was taken so suddenly. \"I know that everyone always says that people are the greatest in the world, but he was the greatest person you could know,\" Kim said. \"He never had a horrible word to say about anyone or anything.\" He often traveled just for work, she added, and this was the first time her parents were getting to go on such a cruise. Michael Oehme, 57 Oehme, of Council Bluff, Iowa, flew to Florida with his wife, Kari, to go on a high seas adventure, his family said. Kari Oehme, 52, suffered a shoulder wound, but was expected to recover, Oehme's sister, Elizabeth Oehme-Miller, told NBC affiliate WOWT . Oehme-Miller said the couple were frequent travelers, and that another family member was flying to Fort Lauderdale to help Kari Oehme come home. Oehme worked as a surveyor, while his wife is a customer service representative for a telecommunications company, according to her Facebook profile. Phil McCausland ",

The revolt, which began Friday in Boake, the country's second-largest city, soon spread to cities and towns nationwide. By Saturday, parts of the Ivory Coast's largest city, Abidjan, were on lockdown, as gunfire was reported at the military base on the edge of the city. There have been no immediate reports of casualties. As NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton notes, the soldiers' grievances center on bonus pay and living conditions. \"One soldier says former fighters integrated into Ivory Coast's army were demanding bonuses of $8,000 apiece \u2014 plus a house,\" Ofeibea reported Friday for the Newscast unit. Defense Minister Alain-Richard Donwahi flew up to Boake to negotiate a deal with the rebellious soldiers. Ouattara announced it afterward to government ministers and reporters, Reuters reports . He said the government \"had agreed to take into account the soldiers' demands,\" according to the news service, while also offering this rebuke: Article continues after sponsorship \"I would like to say that this manner of making demands is not appropriate. It tarnishes the image of our country after all our efforts to revive the economy.\" Ofeibea reports the president has asked the soldiers to return to their barracks. It is believed that many of the mutineers are former rebels, who joined the Ivorian army only after the country's 10-year civil war ended in 2011. The city of Bouake had played a central role as a rebel stronghold during that war. ",
