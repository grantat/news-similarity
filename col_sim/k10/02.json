Jack and his dad, Bob, were lucky to even get into Wrigley Field. Jack Lannon shows the World Series baseball given to him by Cubs owner Tom Ricketts at their standing-room-only perch for Game 4. Jack and his dad, Bob, were lucky to even get into Wrigley Field. (Bob Lannon photo) John Kass Contact Reporter Lifelong Cubs fan Bob Lannon told his son Jack that he would take him to a World Series game at Wrigley Field . \"I've always dreamed of it. At Wrigley, the Series, the Cubs,\" Lannon told me. \"And he wanted to go. So I started looking for tickets.\" Just so you know what you're getting into: This is a story written by a White Sox fan about the Cubs and hope and heartbreak and a happy ending. And there's a fellow named Tom Ricketts whom you might know as the owner of the Cubs. \"I wouldn't have believed it either,\" said Lannon. \"But it happened and I can tell you we were stunned, our jawbones were on the ground.\" It is a dream of fathers in America, this dream of taking a child to a World Series in your hometown, this handing of baseball down through generations. Many dream of this but many can't afford it, or work or life gets in the way. I dreamed of it too, once, when my boys were 10 and the White Sox were in the World Series and I had season tickets. And they asked me, hopeful, in their bedroom one night, their room a White Sox shrine. And to my regret, which is still so bitter that it's hard to type this, it didn't happen because I had to work. And I was thinking about it again the other night, with the Cubs in the series, and scanning my email I spotted a letter from Lannon. Wrigley Field , with their team down 3-1 in the World Series against the Cleveland Indians , you could see something remarkable in Cubs fans. Hope. And it was beautiful. \"What else is there?\" asked Matt Clark, a banker from St. Paul, Minn., who was at the game with his 7-year-old son, James. Nothing,... At Wrigley Field , with their team down 3-1 in the World Series against the Cleveland Indians , you could see something remarkable in Cubs fans. Hope. And it was beautiful. \"What else is there?\" asked Matt Clark, a banker from St. Paul, Minn., who was at the game with his 7-year-old son, James. Nothing,... (John Kass) And after I read it, I called him because I wanted to tell you his story. Lannon, 57, married and in the commercial furniture industry, has three daughters and a son. The kids all play soccer. But his son, Jack, a freshman soccer player at St. Ignatius, loves Cubs baseball. \"He knows all the stats, all the players, and he wanted to go and I wanted to go, so I started looking for tickets,\" Lannon said. Most tickets were ridiculously priced, but he thought he'd found what he was looking for on Craigslist. A guy named Vince from the South Side was offering two tickets for $500 apiece. A deal. \"The summary of the tickets was there, in the ad, with the section and seat number, they were upper-deck seats. And Vince pulled me into his web. He said the tickets were in the family, that they couldn't go to Saturday's game, and I fell for it.\" Before Saturday's game, a meeting was arranged outside the Merchandise Mart near Lannon's office. The tickets looked legitimate. Nachos, check. Program, check. Chance to see the Cubs keep their championship hopes alive in the World Series ? You bet. Cubs fans from across the country poured into Progressive Field in balmy downtown Cleveland on Tuesday night, decked out in signature blue caps and pinstriped jerseys, clinging... Nachos, check. Program, check. Chance to see the Cubs keep their championship hopes alive in the World Series ? You bet. Cubs fans from across the country poured into Progressive Field in balmy downtown Cleveland on Tuesday night, decked out in signature blue caps and pinstriped jerseys, clinging... (Patrick M. O'Connell) \"He didn't even open the envelope to count the money,\" Lannon said. \"That's when I knew something was wrong.\" At the gate they were told what Lannon already suspected. He'd been scammed. Lannon turned over the fake tickets and Vince's cellphone number and other information from Craigslist to Wrigley staff. \"A young guy in a suit behind the counter said, 'Wait here. I'll see what I can do.\" As they waited, what struck him was his son, Jack. \"There was no complaining or whining in him, not one bit,\" said Lannon. \"All he said was, 'That's OK, Dad. It's OK.' He was resolute. And I was so proud of him, the way he handled it.\" The guy in the suit returned, and told Lannon he'd found two standing-room-only tickets for face value. They weren't cheap, $250 apiece, but that was cheaper than what he'd paid Vince. \"The Cubs went out of their way for us. And I'm thinking, face value? We'll take them,\" Lannon said. He looked at his son. And one look at Jack and Lannon was glad that he took the offer. Cubs spokesman Julian Green said it was \"just by chance\" that two standing-room-only tickets were available for Lannon and his son. Green said there is no policy for having tickets available for fans who get scammed. \"Anybody can come up and say, 'Oh my God, I got counterfeit tickets and I'm stuck,'\" Green said. Lannon and his son stood toward the first base side of home plate on the mezzanine level. It was packed and loud and it was perfect. \"There were fans from all over, true Cubs fans, and we could see and we were there,\" said Lannon. \"There was a cast of colorful characters, including Frank the plumber. Jack probably heard more colorful profanity than he'd ever heard in his life.\" Big Papi, Red Sox great David Ortiz , walked past with an entourage, and other stars and celebrities were there too, with their security guards and hangers-on. Then an unassuming fellow walked past, no entourage, no glitz, just a Cubs fan alone. Lannon didn't recognize him. But Jack, the Cubs fan in a Cubs jacket, knew who it was. \"Mr. Ricketts?\" said Jack. Rickets stopped, asked how they liked the game. It was a game the Cubs would lose. But who knew that then? \"Jack started talking to Tom Ricketts and Ricketts reached into his pocket and gave Jack a ball. A game ball, from the World Series game we were watching. It was marked and everything. It's a collector's item now. Ricketts smiled and walked away. \"Our jaws dropped to the ground. We were scammed, we got into the ballpark, and to top it off Tom Ricketts gave my son a game ball.\" The next morning, Lannon went to Mass and let Jack sleep in. Mom made pancakes and Jack wouldn't stop holding that ball. \"My wife said he finally jumped up and said, 'I have to put this away. I can't get maple syrup on it!'\" The Cubs lost that one. But as the best seats thinned out, Lannon and Jack sneaked down to the box seats in the eighth inning and another fan made a photograph. \"Think of the life lessons he learned, and the two of us there, at Wrigley, Tom Ricketts and the game ball, and Cubs fans for life,\" said Lannon. Fathers and sons. Baseball. World Series. It's what we dream of. ",

    "text": "Email 10/27, 2:40 p.m.: Advocates say North Carolina voters are being illegally removed from rolls Civil rights advocates in North Carolina say voters have been illegally removed from the rolls after their eligibility was challenged. The state has said the thousands of removals are legal. Around 4,500 voters in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties were challenged, in many cases after mail sent to their address was returned, the state confirmed in a letter sent Thursday to the NAACP. The majority were in Cumberland County, the letter said. North Carolina law allows for private citizens to formally challenge a voter's eligibility ahead of an election. Cumberland County elections director Terri Robertson told NBC News that around 5,000 voters had been challenged since the start of the year, and around 3,000 had been removed. She said she was too busy with the election to provide exact numbers. Beaufort County elections director Kelli Hopkins told NBC News that 14 voters have been removed, and hearings are pending for about 90 more. Moore County elections director Glenda Clendenin told NBC News that between 300 and 400 voters had been removed in the most recent of two rounds of removals. She declined to estimate how many had been removed in the first round. All three officials said that if challenged voters don't respond to letters or show up to a hearing on their eligibility, they are typically removed. Voting rights lawyer Penda Hair said on a Thursday conference call organized by the NAACP that the group believes over 300 Cumberland County voters have been removed. One challenged voter, Grace Hardison of Beaufort County, is a 100-year-old African-American woman who for much of her life couldn't vote thanks to Jim Crow laws, and has been on the rolls for 30 years, her nephew Greg Satterthwaite said on the NAACP call. The challenge to Hardison was eventually withdrawn and she remains on the rolls. Hair said the removals violate the federal Motor Voter law, which bars systematic purges of the rolls 90 days ahead of an election. Last week, the NAACP notified the state board of elections in a letter that intends to sue. In a response sent Thursday to NAACP North Carolina president William Barber II, state board of elections director Kim Strach maintained that the removals were legal because they're being done on an individual basis rather than systematically. 10/27, 11:11 a.m.: Trump tweets about \"vote flipping\" in Texas, but election officials can't verify Donald Trump tweeted Thursday morning: A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016 NBC News spoke with Toni Pippins-Poole, the elections director for Dallas County, where some of the reports of vote flipping have occurred. She explained that the county's protocol for when voters complain about problems with machines is to cancel the ballot and recalibrate the machine. If they get a second complaint about the same machine, they take it out of service. She said five machines have so far been taken out of service. However, Pippins-Poole said that in no case have administrators been able to replicate the error reported by a voter, and every voter who complained has ultimately been able to vote successfully. Pippins-Poole said a lot of the complaints they've received stem from the fact that the \"Summary Page\" that voters see at the end says \"Incomplete\" if they didn't vote in every race. This often confuses voters into thinking that the votes they did cast have not been recorded (though it wouldn't explain flipping votes from one candidate to another). She said there can also be other forms of voter error, such as when jewelry touches the screen, accidentally registering a vote. In terms of any kind of conspiracy to benefit one candidate and hurt the other, as some on social media are suggesting, Pippins-Poole said: \"That is not happening.\" Other election directors where voters have complained about flipped votes have also attributed the problem to voter error. However, many touch screen machines are over a decade old, so election experts have expressed concern about the potential for malfunctions. A machine in Pennsylvania in 2012 changed votes from Obama to Romney, and there have been credible reports of votes being changed from Clinton to Trump in North Carolina this year. Play ",

Arkin Share Exclusive: Putin Targeting Microsoft to 'Nationalize' Internet 2:40 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161102015300if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/798636099746\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> In his battle with the United States, Vladimir Putin has a new target \u2014 Microsoft. The Kremlin is backing a plan to rid government offices and state-controlled companies of all foreign software, starting with Moscow city government replacing Microsoft products with Russian ones, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official. Last week, the Russians moved toward blocked LinkedIn, the U.S.-based networking site that Microsoft is in the process of buying. The company is appealing an injunction, with a decision expected Nov. 10. The intelligence official said Putin is going after Microsoft because it is the biggest American name in information technology and because it's easy to convince Russians that the company works with the U.S. intelligence community. Russia is also bracing for the U.S. to retaliate for months of hacking attacks that Washington says were authorized by Putin and designed to influence the American electoral process. \"They are obviously stepping up their game,\" Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"It is a signal that the Russians really mean business now about nationalizing the internet and making sure they can create their own secure content.\" Microsoft told NBC News it doesn't collaborate with the government on any spying. \"We don't spy on anyone. We don't work with any government to spy on others, and we never would,\" said Dominic Carr, Microsoft's general manager for public affairs. \"We make sure governments can review our software to confirm for themselves that our products are secure. And we've worked hard to increase privacy protections for customers including by suing the US government four times.\" But the Russians are keenly aware that Microsoft products, like any software, can be used as weapons in cyber-warfare. A sensitive U.S. Homeland Security document obtained by NBC News confirms that a Microsoft Office attachment was used by Russian hackers to shut down the Ukraine electrical grid last year. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Russian President Vladimir Putin AP; Reuters Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he's not surprised Russia is singling out Microsoft since Russia's relationship with the U.S. is at \"the lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War.\" \"Putin as an old KGB officer views the world as a zero-sum game between Russia and the U.S.,\" he said. \"Whatever is good for the U.S. is bad for Russia and vice versa.\" The move against Microsoft \"may also be a way for Russia to signal to its own population we can't trust American technology \u2014 and once again feed into Russian hostility and paranoia towards America and its products,\" Schiff said. \"So as part economic message, part a shot across the bow, part attack on American IT, part protectionism ... all, I think, very consistent with the kind of escalation we are seeing from Putin.\" If the goal is to deal an economic blow to Microsoft, Putin's campaign doesn't appear to be having much of an effect. The company's stock hit $60 a share on Oct. 21 \u2014 an all-time high. U.S. intelligence officials also believe that any attempt to ban Microsoft will be limited because its products are too integrated into Russia's IT infrastructure. Cynthia McFadden ",

Carlos Osorio/AP hide caption toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses a rally at Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich., on Monday. Carlos Osorio/AP Some of the country's most prominent economists have signed a letter warning that Donald Trump is a \"dangerous, destructive\" choice for president and urging voters to choose someone else. The letter , first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was signed by 370 economists, including eight Nobel Prize winners. The text stops short of endorsing Democrat Hillary Clinton, though, and doesn't criticize Trump on ideological grounds. Instead, it says he has made repeated statements aimed at misleading the public about jobs and growth: \"He misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality. If elected, he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of the country.\" Among other things, Trump has told voters that renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement or imposing tariffs on China would increase manufacturing jobs, the letter says. Article continues after sponsorship Why Do We Vote On Tuesdays? \"In fact, manufacturing's share of employment has been declining since the 1970s and is mostly related to automation, not trade,\" it says. Trump has \"lowered the seriousness of the national dialogue\" by saying that the deficit can be reduced by eliminating government agencies such as the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. \"A credible solution will require an increase in tax revenue and/or a reduction in spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or Defense,\" it says. The Republican presidential candidate has also falsely claimed that the United States is one of the most heavily taxed countries in the world, the letter says. It added: \"His statements reveal a deep ignorance of economics and an inability to listen to credible experts. He repeats fake and misleading economic statistics, and pushes fallacies about the [value-added tax] and trade competitiveness. He promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.\" Those signing the letter say they \"represent a broad variety of areas of expertise.\" They include Nobel winners such as Angus Deaton of Princeton, Oliver Hart and Eric Maskin of Harvard and Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford, as well as many other prominent academics. ",

USA TODAY A series of critical tweets from Sen. Bernie Sanders sent shares of Eli Lilly and Co. tumbling Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016. (Photo: AP 2016 file photo) INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 A series of social media posts from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday\u00a0sent shares of Eli Lilly and Co. briefly tumbling to a seven-month low. Sanders' Twitter account\u00a0 posted a\u00a0link \u00a0to a\u00a0 Washington Post article \u00a0detailing the decades-long price increase of a Lilly\u00a0insulin called Humalog. The price of Humalog has risen from $21 a vial to more than $250 during the last 20 years, according to the Post. The tweets went out to Sanders' 2.7 million Twitter followers. They were not signed by Sanders, indicating they were\u00a0written by members of his staff. After sharing the Post's article, Sanders' account posted several more messages that were\u00a0sharply critical of the Indianapolis drugmaker. \"Why has the price of Humalog insulin gone up 700% in 20 years?\"\u00a0 one post read .\u00a0\"It's simple. The drug industry's greed.\" Humalog is a fast-acting insulin used to control blood sugar for people with diabetes. As Sanders' Twitter account blasted Lilly, the company's stock price dropped 2.4 percent from its opening price\u00a0to $72.02 per share at 12:35 p.m.\u00a0That was the stock's lowest price since March 31. Shares\u00a0quickly rebounded, rising to\u00a0$72.75 by 2:30 p.m. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk clearly care more about their profits than their patients. It's time to end their greed. pic.twitter.com/MqCsHNjzcO \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) November 1, 2016 Lilly in a statement defended its pricing of Humalog, noting the product's revenue has been lagging. \"A permanent solution that gives everyone who uses insulin reasonable access will require leadership and cooperation across many stakeholders, including manufacturers, (pharmacy benefit managers), payers, and policymakers,\" the statement said. \"That\u2019s because the answer itself isn\u2019t simple. \"For instance, while the list price for Humalog has gone up, Lilly actually receives a lower average net price now than in 2009. When Lilly released third quarter earnings on October 25, the biggest miss noted was Humalog, whose US revenue fell 14 percent, driven by a 24 percent decline in net price.\u201d Sanders also targeted Lilly competitor\u00a0Novo Nordisk, a Danish drugmaker whose insulin price has risen at a rate similar to Humalog, according to the Post. It wasn't\u00a0the first time Sanders has targeted the drug industry on social media \u2014 nor the first time markets have reacted to his tweets. Sanders' Twitter account in October criticized Ariad Pharmaceuticals over its pricing of a leukemia drug,\u00a0 causing that company's stock to fall 15 percent . A spokesman for Sanders did not respond to a request for comment. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also has caused market jitters for\u00a0pharmaceuticals. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index\u00a0 fell 4.7 percent in September 2015 \u00a0after a post from Clinton's Twitter account accused the industry of \"price gouging.\" When Clinton\u00a0called for a price cut for the\u00a0EpiPen, manufacturer\u00a0 Mylan NV\u2019s shares fell 6.2 percent .

Controversy has been brewing for months over the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would transport crude oil from fields in North Dakota across four states. Tensions came to a head in recent days with violent clashes between police and protesters trying to block the pipeline's path, ratcheting up the pressure on Clinton to take a side. Clinton, who weighed in on the Dakota Access pipeline for the first time last week in a noncommittal statement, finds herself torn between labor unions on one side, who want the jobs created by the project, and Native American activists and environments on the other side, who say the pipeline would pollute water and violate sacred land. \"If Clinton thought Keystone was bad, get ready for Dakota Access. This is an issue that is not going away,\" said Jamie Henn, a co-founder of the environmental group 350 Action, which has endorsed Clinton and is canvassing members to help get her elected. \"She's triangulating and you shouldn't triangulate on issues of social justice.\" Play Trump's financial ties to Dakota Pipeline 8:01 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161102152921if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/794580547856\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The pipeline, which is already under construction, would come within a half mile of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, where tribal activists have been resisting it since April. On Thursday, activists erected a teepee in the lobby of Clinton's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn as part of a protest designed to pressure her to oppose the pipeline. And on Sunday, Our Revolution, the group that grew out of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, started a petition calling on Clinton to kill the pipeline, even as Sanders campaigns for the Democratic nominee. \"There is one person who will have the power to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline: Secretary Hillary Clinton. If she is to be our next president, she will have the power to stop the pipeline. And our best opportunity to get her to oppose it is before the election,\" the petition read. Sanders also joined a protest outside the White House against the pipeline and has formally requested President Obama intervene in the situation.

But opponents are calling on Obama, and Clinton if she wins, to revoke permits issued by the Army Corps of Engineers and implement a more thorough environmental and tribal review process. Meanwhile, on the other side is not just Energy Transfer Partners, the Dallas-based company behind the $3.7 billion project, but many labor unions that have been key allies of Clinton and other Democrats. (According to his financial disclosure forms, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has close ties to the pipeline through his investment in Energy Transfer Partners, whose CEO has donated more than $100,000 to Trump's campaign.) The AFl-CIO, the union umbrella organization that represents millions of workers, came out in favor of the pipeline in September. \"Pipelines are less costly, more reliable and less energy intensive than other forms of transporting fuels, and pipeline construction and maintenance provides quality jobs to tens of thousands of skilled workers,\" said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. Support inside the labor movement has been led by the Laborers' International Union of North America, whose president, Terry O'Sullivan, sent a scathing letter to members last week excoriating the handful of unions that have spoken out against the pipeline. \"Some of our so-called brothers and sisters in the trade union movement have abandoned solidarity with the working class and are instead throwing in with environmentalists who have co-opted the tribes in their effort to fight pipelines,\" O'Sullivan wrote. \"LIUNA will not forget the reprehensible actions.\" Play ",

    "text": "Enlarge this image Voters cast their votes at an early voting center in Miami, Fla. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Voters cast their votes at an early voting center in Miami, Fla. Joe Raedle/Getty Images A week away from Election Day, Democrats still have multiple paths to winning back the Senate. Meanwhile, Republicans are hoping that new revelations about possible new Hillary Clinton emails related to her private server can only bolster the \"check and balance\" argument they need to make for voters to separate their GOP candidates from the top of the ticket. Overall, the Senate landscape looks largely unchanged from a week ago. Illinois is all but gone \u2014 made worse by a cringe-worthy gaffe from Sen. Mark Kirk. Wisconsin could be tighter than once thought, though Democratics still have an edge. Two Weeks Out: Democrats Have The Edge In The Fight For The Senate The next four races are coin-flips in terms of which outranks the other by likelihood to flip party. Arguments could be made for putting them in multiple orders. Pennsylvania and New Hampshire remain toss-ups in the truest sense of the word, and if Donald Trump can improve his standing in those states by even a few points, not even necessarily winning, GOP incumbents could survive. Republican chances are looking better in Indiana as well, though strategists are increasingly sour on their chances in Missouri, North Carolina and Nevada. However, if the email news for Clinton worsens, those could begin to look brighter for Republicans. So while there are still multiple calculations for Democrats to get the five seats they need to flip control (or four if Clinton wins the White House), it's by no means a done deal. If these closest races break the Republicans' way, they could indeed hang onto the upper chamber. But they really need almost everything to go right for them in order for that to happen. Article continues after sponsorship Here were our rankings a week ago. The biggest changes: Indiana drops three slots, as former Sen. Evan Bayh (D) has had a bad October; Missouri moves up a couple spots, as incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt hasn't run the kind of race he's needed to against a strong Democratic fresh-face contender. Really, there are only eight races that will likely decide control of the Senate. And amazingly, races in Ohio and Florida aren't among them. Here's where we see the races now: 1. Illinois (R-Mark Kirk) Previous rank: 1 'Your Parents Came All The Way From Thailand': Senator Wrongly Hits Rival On Heritage Realistically, this one was already lost for Republicans. But any lingering hopes were dashed when Kirk made a damaging, puzzling jab at his opponent, Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, in their debate last week, calling into question the wounded Iraq veteran's heritage and military service. Now the only question is how big will Duckworth's margin be. 2. Wisconsin (R-Ron Johnson) Previous rank: 2 Republicans still see some signs of life here, and Democrats have some lingering worries, evidenced by a new $2 million investment by the Senate Majority PAC. It's likely just an insurance policy, but this one hasn't been completely put away by former Sen. Russ Feingold either as Democrats had hoped. 3. Pennsylvania (R-Pat Toomey) Previous rank: 4 The trend line isn't good for Republicans here. This is the most expensive race this cycle , with candidates and outside groups spending spending over $113 million. It's a pricey race each party badly needs in their column, and more importantly for Toomey, it looks like one where Trump isn't going to do well at all. 4. Missouri (R-Roy Blunt) Previous rank: 6 Polls are finally showing what Republicans have feared for weeks now \u2014 this one is not looking good for them. \"I think it's done, gone,\" said one Republican tracking Senate races. Blunt has run exactly the wrong type of campaign in a year where the electorate is hungry for outsider candidates, and Secretary of State Jason Kander (D) has been that type of candidate in a relatable, appealing way. The one hope is that with the new concerns over Clinton's emails, conservative and independent voters could think twice about sending a Democrat to Washington. 5. Indiana (Open, R-Dan Coats is retiring) Previous rank: 3 In Indiana's Senate Race, Political Royalty Tries To Put On A Fresh Face Polls are moving in the wrong direction for former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh, whose once double-digit lead has now completely evaporated. Trump is expected to win here easily, which will help GOP Rep. Todd Young, too. There have been too many questions about Bayh's lobbyist ties and his real ties to Indiana since he left office six years ago. Young's finances have come under scrutiny in the final week, which could damage his some in the final stretch, though. 6. New Hampshire (R-Kelly Ayotte) Previous rank: 5 This race remains tight, but Republicans don't feel super optimistic here either while Democrats do. Both Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan have remained relatively favorable in voters' minds. But the question here \u2014 as in so many other races \u2014 is how much can Ayotte outperform Trump atop the ticket. 7. North Carolina (R-Richard Burr) Previous rank: 7 The headlines you don't want a week out from Election Day are that you joked about the Democratic presidential nominee getting shot , but that's exactly what Burr faces. The Republican incumbent has since apologized for remarks he made to campaign volunteers that he saw a rifle magazine in a gun shop with Clinton's photo and was \"shocked\" that \"it didn't have a bull's eye on it.\" Early voting looks good in the Tar Heel State for demographics and areas that former state Rep. Deborah Ross needs to win. 8. Nevada (Open, D-Harry Reid) Previous rank: 8 For months, this had been the lone bright spot for Republicans, as they dreamed about taking over the Senate Minority Leader's seat. But early voting also doesn't portend well for Republicans here, and even as strong a candidate as GOP Rep. Joe Heck may not be able to swim against the tide. National GOP strategists don't feel great about this one any longer. 9. Florida (R-Marco Rubio) Previous rank: 9 The GOP senator can absolutely outperform Trump here, and the race may seem closer than it really is. Senate Majority PAC has put in some money again to help Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy amid grumbling that they were letting a possible 2020 presidential candidate and a Republican rising star skate through. But in the expensive Sunshine State, it's a drop in the bucket. 10. Arizona (R-John McCain) Previous rank: 10 The gap between the first nine contests and this one is huge. Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick will benefit from the Clinton campaign's focus on this unexpected swing state, but McCain should have no trouble defeating her. Correction Nov. 1, 2016 An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Republicans have an edge in the Wisconsin Senate race. Democrats have the edge. ",

The clearest sign of that comes in the form of a $25 million ad buy that includes new spots in Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Mexico, all of which are classified as leaning Democratic in the current ABC News state ratings. The only of those three states that has recent reputable polling is Pennsylvania, the latest of which has Clinton leading by six points in the Oct. 16 Quinnipiac survey. Michigan hasn't voted Republican since 1988 and New Mexico has only voted Republican once since that same year. A Split on Popular and Electoral College Vote Not Out of the Question The campaign sent out a release saying that the significant ad buy comes as \"an open acknowledgment that the campaign is surging in traditionally blue states as well as traditional battleground states.\" All told, the buy will foot the bill for ads in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Maine, North Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, Virginia, Nevada and New Hampshire as well. It comes after today's ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll has Trump earning 46 percent support nationally to Clinton's 45 percent, a difference within the margin of error. ABC News PHOTO:\u00a0state ratings There have been a number of potential morale boosts to the Trump campaign in recent days. On Friday, FBI director James Comey sent a letter announcing that there would be further review into newly discovered emails relating to Hillary Clinton 's private server from her time as Secretary of State, which Trump had been calling for repeatedly during the campaign. The email issue has plagued her throughout her presidential run, despite the FBI recommending no charges in the case over the summer. Also on Friday, Trump gave $10 million of his money to his campaign, bringing that his personal spending total to $18.6 million contributed and $47.5 million in loans. On Sunday, he received his second newspaper endorsement of the campaign, this time from the Las Vegas Review-Journal which is owned by his supporter Sheldon Adelson . The campaign is also scheduling public appearances from some important figures on their roster. Deputy campaign manager David Bossie, who makes far fewer press appearances than campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, spoke to \" Good Morning America \" today about their recent uptick in the polls. \"We have closed this gap dramatically over the last week,\" Bossie said. Another infrequent face on the campaign trail will be turning up this week as well as Melania Trump is slated to give a speech on Thursday in Pennsylvania. For his part, Trump appears happy with the campaign's recent uptick, sharing the news with his 12.8 million Twitter followers. Wow, now leading in @ABC / @washingtonpost Poll 46 to 45. Gone up 12 points in two weeks, mostly before the Crooked Hillary blow-up! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2016 0 Shares ",

The talk, which took place after a regularly scheduled national security meeting at the FBI yesterday, was a \"one on one\" discussion, according to the source who briefed ABC News. The FBI, which previously investigated Clinton's use of a private email server while she served as secretary of state, has pulled the hard drive from a laptop used by Abedin's now estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation for allegedly sexting with a minor. The source said the two talked about \"the seriousness of the ongoing matter\" which has caused a political firestorm in the final days before the Nov. 8 election. Lynch wanted to check in to see how the FBI chief is doing, the source told ABC News. The conversation was described as \"cordial,\u201d and it was the first time the two spoke in person since the latest controversy erupted on Friday. The FBI and Lynch remain under pressure to release more information about the investigation.

    "text": "How Donald Trump's Remarks About Renewed Clinton Email Probe Mirror Birtherism By TOM LIDDY Nov 1, 2016, 3:02 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Hillary Clinton Tries to Shift Campaign Tone 0 Shares Email During a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Monday, Donald Trump said he was \"sure\" that what's contained in the emails at the center of the FBI 's renewed probe into Hillary Clinton 's use of a private server is \"absolutely devastating.\" Those emails are under review by the FBI, and their content has not been released publicly, but Trump appears certain in his pronouncement despite a lack of evidence. His trading on uncertainty without proof may seem familiar: His talk of the renewed probe mirrors his years-long perpetuation of the birther movement. A Look Back at October Surprises and Why Clinton's Email May Not Be One Birtherism Before the 2012 presidential race , when Trump considered a run, the real estate mogul cast aspersions on President Barack Obama, questioning whether he was a natural-born U.S. citizen and therefore eligible to be president. During Trump's initial push of birtherism, he repeatedly suggested that there was something amiss with Obama's birth certificate, despite having no evidence to support that claim. \"I want him to show his birth certificate,\" Trump said on ABC's \"The View\" in 2011. \"There is something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like.\" Birtherism was strongly linked to the theory that Obama is a secret Muslim and wants to hide his religion from the American people. Trump floated that possibility on Bill O'Reilly's show on Fox News in 2011. \"People have birth certificates. He doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there's something on that, maybe religion. Maybe it says he is a Muslim,\" he said . \"I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want that. Or he may not have one. But I will tell you this. If he wasn't born in this country, it's one of the great scams of all time.\" Trump also claimed on the \"Today\" show in April 2011 that he dispatched investigators to look into the matter \"and they cannot believe what they're finding.\" He claimed during the segment that Obama's certificate of live birth was \"easy to get\" and that Obama spent $2 million in legal fees to avoid the issue. That month, Obama released his birth certificate, but that still didn't satisfy Trump, who wrote on Twitter that it was a \"fraud.\" An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama 's birth certificate is a fraud. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2012 And in 2013, one of the last times that he publicly discussed the issue before his presidential run, Trump again refused to acknowledge the evidence presented by Obama. \"Well, I don't know. Was there a birth certificate? You tell me. You know some people say that was not his birth certificate. So maybe it was, maybe it wasn't,\" he told ABC News' Jon Karl . As recently as Sept. 15 of this year, Trump refused to acknowledge that Obama was born in the United States, but the next day, after five years, Trump finally conceded, \"President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.\" Clinton Email Probe Trump has gone to great lengths to paint Clinton as the most corrupt politician in American history, repeatedly calling her \"crooked Hillary,\" among other monikers. \"Hillary's corruption is a threat to democracy, and the only way to stop it is for you on Nov. 8 to show up at the polls and vote,\" he said at an appearance in Warren, Michigan, Monday. He has called her a criminal on many occasions. \"Hillary is the one who set up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity ,\" he told the crowd Monday. He even threatened during their second debate to throw her in jail if he becomes president. Clinton was admonished this summer by FBI Director James Comey for her handling of email, including classified information, on her private email server while she was the secretary of state. She has acknowledged she made \"a mistake\" by using the private server. But she and her top aides have not been criminally charged in the matter. The FBI did not recommend charges in the case, and the DOJ declined to prosecute. Comey explained at the time that \"it takes mishandling it and criminal intent\" to make a case. \"I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent. That I could establish. What we can't establish is that she acted with the necessary criminal intent,\" he said . \"'Should have known,' 'must have known,' 'had to know' does not get you there. You have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they knew they were engaged in something that was unlawful.\" In a memo to FBI employees, Comey said the case was \"not a cliffhanger\" and \"really wasn't a prosecutable case.\" Little is known publicly about the new batch of emails, found on the computer of Clinton aide Huma Abedin 's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. In a letter to lawmakers Friday, Comey said the new emails \"appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" But in an internal memo sent later that day, he said the agency doesn't \"know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.\" It is also not clear whether any of the emails were sent by Clinton or if they contain any sensitive information. Clinton has slammed the review, saying there is \"no case here.\" But that didn't stop Trump from pouncing on Monday. \"We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating, and I think we're going to find out, by the way, for the first time,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

The release comes amid the bureau's controversially timed review of emails from a Hillary Clinton aide. The 129 pages of heavily censored material about Bill Clinton's presidential pardon of Marc Rich were published Monday on the FBI's Freedom of Information Act webpage and noted by one of the bureau's Twitter accounts Tuesday. Earlier in October, the FBI unit published historical files as far back as 1966 about Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump. The Clinton campaign questioned the bureau's decision to make the file public so close to Tuesday's election. \"Absent a (Freedom of Information Act) deadline, this is odd,\" Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted. \"Will FBI be posting docs on Trumps' housing discrimination in `70s?\" Fallon's reference was to news accounts of a 1973 federal housing discrimination lawsuit, later settled, against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. In response to questions Tuesday from The Associated Press, the FBI said that the Marc Rich documents \"became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBI's public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures.\" The bureau said that under law, documents requested three or more times are made public \"shortly after they are processed.\" That processing, the bureau said, is on a \"first in, first out basis.\" Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he saw the FBI tweet shortly before he boarded Air Force One with President Barack Obama for a trip to Columbus, Ohio, to campaign for Hillary Clinton, but was unaware that anyone at the White House was consulted about the material before it was released. \"I've not spoke to anybody who has any awareness of being consulted about that material before it was released,\" Earnest told reporters traveling with the president. The newly released FBI documents are from a 2001 federal investigation into Bill Clinton's pardon at the end of his administration of Marc Rich, who was indicted in 1983 and evaded prosecution in Switzerland. Rich died in 2013. The files briefly cited the Clinton Foundation in connection with a large donation in support of Clinton's presidential library. The FBI documents cited public records showing that an unidentified person donated to \"the William J. Clinton Foundation, a foundation that supports the Clinton presidential library.\" Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, pledged a $450,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation's project to develop and build the presidential facility. The new FBI archive does not name Denise Rich, but FBI agents sought to talk to her as part of the probe into her former husband's pardon. Despite the extensive redactions, the FBI archive cites evidence being prepared for a federal grand jury, agents' reports and internal memos. Agents appeared to be interested in a New York dinner in which the Rich pardon may have been discussed. The federal probe started under then-U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, who now heads the Securities and Exchange Commission for the Obama administration. When White left office in 2003, she was replaced by James Comey, the FBI director now under fire for notifying Congress last week about his agency's decision to review emails to and from Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The Rich investigation did not lead to federal charges under Comey and the case was closed in 2005. Advertisement ",

The decade-old case could set an important precedent in the entertainment industry because it addresses the boundaries of public domain material, and gives studios a legal upper hand in protecting their intellectual property. At the center of the dispute is\u00a0Leo Valencia, the head of several\u00a0nostalgia and vintage companies\u00a0that obtained\u00a0images of the films from publicity materials, including posters and\u00a0lobby cards. He licensed those images for a range of consumer products, such as shirts and\u00a0lunchboxes, according to the complaint. Warner filed a suit against Valencia and his companies in 2006, claiming copyright and trademark infringement.\u00a0But the defense has argued that the images in question fall within the public domain because they were publicity material.\u00a0 In 2009, a court ruled in the studio\u2019s favor and issued an injunction, but the decision was appealed. Two years later, the\u00a0Court of Appeals for the  8th Circuit in St. Louis ruled that copyright infringement occurred in two circumstances \u2014 when the publicity images were used in three-dimensional objects, such as\u00a0a statuette or action figure,\u00a0or were combined with other images or text to create a composite image. But the court said that reproducing publicity material as an identical two-dimensional image didn\u2019t constitute copyright infringement. The defense filed another appeal, but this week, a court upheld the ruling as well as damages amounting to $10,000 for 257 copyright infractions, resulting in an award of nearly $2.6 million.\u00a0 The judgment \u201csends\u00a0a strong message about the risk of engaging in copyright and trademark infringement,\u201d said\u00a0Frederick J. Sperling, a partner at the law firm Schiff Hardin LLP, who represented Warner Bros. Valencia, the defendant, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment sent through a lawyer.\u00a0 The case was filed in Missouri because some of the licensees selling the products in question were based in the state.\u00a0 In upholding the damages amount, the appeals court cited a 2012 Capitol Records case in which the label sued an individual for putting copyrighted songs on the Kazaa file-sharing platform. In that case, a court awarded damages of $9,250 per infringed work.\u00a0 Damages for copyright infringement range between\u00a0$750 and $30,000 per instance, according to U.S. law. In its 2011 decision, the  8th Circuit court ruled that characters such as\u00a0Dorothy and the Scarecrow, as well as Scarlett O\u2019Hara and Rhett Butler,\u00a0are \u201csufficiently distinctive to merit character protection under the respective film copyrights.\u201d Court documents show that the defendants licensed the film images for use on shirts, lunchboxes, music box lids\u00a0and playing cards. They were also used\u00a0as models for three-dimensional objects such as\u00a0statuettes, busts, figurines inside water globes\u00a0and action figures.

President Obama narrowly won it twice, but so did George W. Bush. \u201cI would like to see Donald Trump win this election,\u201d McNemar said, and she especially likes his plans for the economy.

Donna McNemar CBS News \u201cIf we\u2019re forced to pay $15 for minimum wage, guess who\u2019s gonna work more hours? Me. Because I\u2019m going to have to lay off employees. I can\u2019t, we can\u2019t, handle that kind of increase,\u201d McNemar said. She also favors Trump\u2019s tax plan , with across the board cuts, the biggest for the wealthiest Americans. Clinton\u2019s plan would raise taxes on the rich. \u201cI understand that they\u2019re wealthy and make a lot of money. But I also understand that they worked really hard for that money and if they have to pay more taxes it has to go somewhere and it\u2019s going to come down to me,\u201d McNemar said.

    "text": "CBS/AP November 1, 2016, 8:11 PM Rare White House residence photos released in Obamas' final days Email No matter what happens on Nov. 8, the Obamas will be moving out of the White House.\u00a0 President Barack Obama likes to say the White House is the \u201cpeople\u2019s house.\u201d Now, the people are getting a look at the rooms where he lives. Exclusive photos published Tuesday by Architectural Digest are giving the public its first glimpse of private areas on the second floor of the White House that Obama, his wife, Michelle, daughters Malia and Sasha and family dogs Bo and Sunny have called home for nearly eight years. The image provided by Architectural Digest shows the Yellow Oval Room in the White House in Washington. Designer Michael S. Smith specified a Donald Kaufman paint for the Yellow Oval Room. Artworks by Paul C\u00e9zanne and Daniel Garber flank the mantel. Smith mellowed the Yellow Oval Room with smoky browns, greens, golds, and blues. The 1978 Camp David peace accords were signed at the antique Denis-Louis Ancellet desk, front left.\u00a0 Michael Mundy/Architectural Digest via AP Los Angeles-based interior designer Michael Smith decorated the rooms, as well as the Oval Office. A mutual friend in Chicago introduced him to the Obamas after the 2008 election. The first lady said Smith managed to reflect her family\u2019s tastes while respecting the history of the White House. \u201cAbove all, it has truly felt like a home for our family,\u201d she told the magazine.\u00a0 This photo provided by Architectural Digest show the Old Family Dining room in the White House in Washington. Works by Robert Rauschenberg, right, and Alma Thomas, the first African American artist woman represented in the White House, left, make a modern splash. Michael Mundy/Architectural Digest via AP Photos show the Yellow Oval Room; the Treaty Room, where Obama retreats late at night to read briefing material for the next day; a sitting room; a dining room; and the master bedroom. The rooms are adorned with a variety of modern and contemporary art borrowed from major art institutions, such as the National Gallery of Art and Smithsonian museums. Architectural Digest has also published photos of the private living quarters of Presidents John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. This Architectural Digest photo shows The Treaty Room in the White House in Washington in August 2016. The room is filled with memorabilia including one of President Barack Obama\u2019s two Grammy Awards, family photos, and a personalized football. It\u2019s also where Obama often retreats late at night. He uses the room\u2019s namesake table, which has been in the White House since 1869, as a desk.\u00a0 Michael Mundy/Architectural Digest via AP Amy Astley, the editor in chief, said the Obamas\u2019 personal style, and the history and diversity of the nation, are reflected in their art and decor choices. The Architectural Digest issue with photos of the Obama living quarters is scheduled to appear on newsstands on Nov. 8, Election Day. Decorated in beige hues, the master bedroom has an antique canopy bed decked out with fine Italian linen.

Democratic candidate for Congress Mark Hunt greets members of the Putnam County Democratic Club at an Ice Cream social event in Eleanor W.Va. on Saturday, Oct. 29, 2016. Hunt, a father who once made a desperate attempt to clone his deceased son, gives West Virginia Democrats their best shot at reclaiming a seat in Congress this year.\u00a0 AP Photo/Tyler Evert Email CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A father who once made a desperate attempt to clone his deceased son is giving West Virginia Democrats their best shot at reclaiming a seat in Congress. In a presidential election year woefully short on civility, the cloning attempt 17 years ago hasn\u2019t been used against Mark Hunt once in the contest. Hunt only talks about it when asked, but he\u2019s not ashamed to tell the story. The advancement could one day fight a range of conditions including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. CBS News medical consultant Dr. David Agus discu... Hunt\u2019s baby boy still beams a smile down over his dad from a framed picture in his office in the law firm he\u2019s run for 22 years. Andrew died at 10 months old, and would have been 18 years old in October. \u201cThat\u2019s that child right there, with those blue eyes that you could look in and see eternity,\u201d Hunt said. Hunt said Republican Rep. Alex Mooney won\u2019t revisit the issue because polls show people will sympathize with him as a grieving parent. Mooney said he doesn\u2019t think cloning is right, but he doesn\u2019t plan to bring the issue up in the race for the 2nd Congressional District, which stretches across the middle of the state, through Charleston and the Eastern Panhandle\u2019s Washington suburbs. Hunt, who served 14 years in the House of Delegates, pointed out that he was elected multiple times after the cloning episode. It\u2019s gut-wrenching every time the topic comes up, Hunt said. \u201cMy son died. We would\u2019ve done anything to save him. We would\u2019ve done anything to create a twin of him, if it were possible. We tried,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cWe broke no laws. We spent our money. And maybe we were taken advantage of by people. But finally we had to let him go.\u201d After Andrew died from complications after surgery to correct heart defects in 1999, Hunt and his wife, Tracy, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to quietly set up a laboratory inside a Nitro, West Virginia community center, and hired Brigitte Boisselier, the chief executive of Clonaid, to clone their son\u2019s DNA. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said she misspoke with a comment vowing to put the coal industry \"out of business,\" after receiving plent... The lab never came close to actually cloning a human. Hunt shut it down within months under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration, and cut ties with the founders of Clonaid, who also promoted what they called the Raelian Movement and claimed extraterrestrial scientists created life on Earth. For scientific, ethical, and commercial reasons, no reputable experts have tried to clone a complete human since. Outside the Legislature, Hunt has become wealthy suing drug and insurance companies over faulty product claims, and he and his wife are raising two other sons. This election contest instead has focused on issues more relevant to the duties of a congressman. Hunt is painting Mooney as missing-in-action, particularly for taking a trip to Egypt and Jordan in June while floods ravaged the state and killed 23 people. Mooney said he was visiting the troops, and cut that trip short to return home for the floods. \u201cI left on the Friday, the same day unfortunately the floods started, and I made the decision to keep my commitment,\u201d he said. Mooney is running on his record of trying to limit the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s power, promote gun rights and oppose abortion. Hunt says jobs are his primary goal; he promises to secure federal infrastructure funding and draw businesses and tourism to West Virginia. Mooney rode into office on a wave of GOP support in 2014, when longtime Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall lost in another district and the state Legislature flipped to Republican control for the first time in more than eight decades. Sen. Joe Manchin is now the only Democrat left in West Virginia\u2019s five-member congressional delegation. Hunt topped a crowded field in the Democratic primary, has put $270,300 of his own money into the campaign, and expects to have contributed $500,000 by Election Day. Mooney had spent $762,400 through late October, about double Hunt\u2019s spending. Mooney has cast his lot with Donald Trump, popular in West Virginia for making broad-stroke promises to put coal miners back to work. His yard signs call for a Trump-Mooney ticket. Hunt called Trump and Hillary Clinton \u201cthorny choices.\u201d Like many West Virginia Democrats plagued by their nominee\u2019s unpopularity in the state, Hunt is publicly neutral in the presidential race. Even with Trump atop the ballot, Hunt sees an opportunity after the GOP-led Legislature in 2015 eliminated straight-party voting, where clicking one box picks all candidates from one party. The option heavily favored Republicans in 2014 after it largely only aided Democrats in previous elections. \u201cThat was one of their promises to the electorate, that they would change straight-line voting,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cBy George, they did it, to their detriment, I think.\u201d Hunt is dogging Mooney for seeking office quickly after moving into the state from Maryland, where he was a state lawmaker and GOP chairman. Issues like that are relevant - not the cloning story, he said. Mooney \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the guts\u201d to revisit it, Hunt said. \u201cIt would backfire on him so badly, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

U.S. airstrikes and special forces are backing the Iraqis as they liberate Mosul from ISIS. The fight is expected to last weeks -- if not months. ISIS is still in control of Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, but Iraqi and Kurdish forces are closing in and U.S. warplanes and special forces ... Iraq\u2019s special forces fought their way into the outskirts of Mosul on Tuesday, taking its state television building despite resistance by Islamic State group fighters that is only likely to stiffen when combat reaches the inner city. It was the first time Iraqi troops have set foot in the city, Iraq\u2019s second-largest, in more than two years. The advance was the start of what is likely to be a grueling and slow operation for the forces as they fend off booby traps and ambushes in difficult, house-to-house fighting expected to take weeks, if not months. Troops entered Gogjali, a neighborhood inside Mosul\u2019s city limits, and later the outskirts of the more built-up Karama district, according to Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces. As the sun went down, a sandstorm blew in, reducing visibility to only 100 yards and bringing the day\u2019s combat to an end. \u201c Daesh is fighting back and have set up concrete blast walls to block off the Karama neighborhood and our troops\u2019 advance,\u201d al-Aridi said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. He said bombs have been laid along the road into the city. Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by U.S.-led airstrikes launched coordinated military operations to retake Iraq's second-largest city Later, al-Aridi said the troops had taken the state television building, the only one in the province, and that heavy fighting broke out when they tried to continue further into built-up areas. An official casualty report was not given, but officers mentioned one dead and one wounded. Mosul is the last major ISIS stronghold in Iraq, the city from which it drove out a larger but demoralized Iraqi army in 2014 and declared a \u201ccaliphate\u201d that stretched into Syria. Its loss would be a major defeat for the jihadis, but with the closest Iraqi troops still some six miles from the city center, much ground remains to be covered. Tuesday\u2019s battle opened with Iraqi artillery, tank and machine gun fire on ISIS positions on the edge of Gogjali, with the extremists responding with guided anti-tank missiles and small arms in an attempt to block the advance. Airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition supporting the operation added to the fire hitting the district. Col. John Dorrian, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, said that aerial observations of the battlefield showed that IS forces can no longer move in large numbers. Iraqi forces continued their push to retake the city of Mosul from ISIS. CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams joins CBSN from northern I... \u201cIf Daesh stand and fight, they\u2019re going to be killed. There\u2019s no question about that. If they run, they will either be captured or killed. They are not going to be allowed to escape,\u201d he said in a televised news conference with Iraqi forces in Qayara, south of Mosul. \u201cWhen we see them come together where there are significant numbers we will strike them and kill them.\u201d Smoke could be seen rising Tuesday from buildings in Gogjali, where shells and bombs had landed. IS-lit fires also sent plumes of dark smoke into the sky, in an attempt to obscure coalition warplanes\u2019 view of the city. Inside the village of Bazwaya, five kilometers (three miles) east of Mosul, white flags hung from buildings, put up a day earlier by residents eager to show they would not resist the Iraqi forces\u2019 advance. Some residents stood outside their homes, and children raised their hands with V-for-victory signs. The families, estimated to number in the hundreds, will be evacuated from the village to a camp for displaced persons, said Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil of the Iraqi special forces. As the fighting raged on Mosul\u2019s outskirts, several of the newly displaced from Bazwaya could be seen carrying white flags as they drove a herd of some 150 sheep toward the camp. The battle against ISIS in Mosul pits airstrikes and helicopter gunships deployed by America and its allies against suicide bombers. The US milit... Emad Hassan, a 33-year-old former policeman, said he came to Bazwaya when the operation to retake Mosul started after fleeing IS fighters in the city. \u201cWhen I knew the security forces were serious about liberating Mosul, I came here,\u201d he said. \u201cDaesh was preventing families from moving toward the security forces and ordered them into the city center, but I refused.\u201d For more than two weeks, Iraqi forces and their Kurdish allies, Sunni tribesmen and Shiite militias have been converging on Mosul from all directions to drive IS from the city. The forces have made uneven progress in closing in on the city. Advances have been slower to the south, with government troops still 20 miles away. Kurdish fighters and Iraqi army units are deployed to the north, while Shiite militias are sweeping in from the west to try to cut off any IS escape route. The Iranian-backed Shiite forces, known as the Popular Mobilization Units, are not supposed to enter Mosul, given concerns that the battle for the Sunni-majority city could aggravate sectarian tensions. Live video provided by the militias to The Associated Press showed dozens of vehicles, including militia tanks, advancing toward Tal Afar, a town to the west of the city. Meanwhile, the army\u2019s ninth division was moving toward Mosul on a path cleared by the special forces, and was approximately two miles from its eastern outskirts. The U.S. military estimates ISIS has 3,000 to 5,000 fighters in Mosul and another 1,500 to 2,500 in its outer defensive belt. That total includes about 1,000 foreign fighters. They stand against an anti-IS force of some 40,000, including army units, militarized police, special forces and Kurdish fighters. Smoke rises from oil wells, set ablaze by Islamic State militants before fleeing the oil-producing region of Qayyara, Iraq, on Nov. 1, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS/Alaa Al-Marjani The foreign fighters are a source of particular ire for the Iraqi troops and have given them \u201cbig motivation\u201d to liberate Mosul, Gen. Talib Shaghati al-Kenani told an AP reporter accompanying the Iraqi forces. \u201cWe are listening to and are able to access their communications. There are fighters from Uzbekistan, Turkey and many other nationalities. Those are a group of terrorists who fight Iraqis and usurp their cities,\u201d he said. A video published online by ISIS purported to show life inside Mosul\u2019s Karama district just a day earlier. Released by the militant\u2019s Aamaq news agency, the footage showed residents insisting that life was normal and that no anti-ISIS forces had entered the neighborhood. \u201cWe hear the thud of the bombs fired by our brothers\u201d at the Iraqi forces, said a bearded man in a wheelchair on a market street where taxis and shoppers passed by unimpeded.

    "text": "WATCH Hillary Clinton In A Minute 0 Shares Email North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr is apologizing after he was caught telling Republican supporters that he was surprised Hillary Clinton appeared on the cover of a gun magazine without a bull's-eye on her face. Burr is locked in a tight race for a third term against Deborah Ross, whom national Democrats see as one of their best chances to pick up a seat as they try to retake the Senate. Burr is the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee and one of the chamber's more powerful Republicans. Ross, who has hammered Burr for supporting Donald Trump, said the remark was out of line. Trump ignited his own controversy on the subject in August when he suggested \"Second Amendment people\" might find a way to stop Clinton from rolling back gun rights with her Supreme Court nominations. Trump later said he was merely trying to suggest the strong voting power of gun rights supporters. On the audio obtained by CNN, Burr tells a private gathering about his thoughts when he saw a copy of American Rifleman in a gun shop. \"It's got a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it. I was a little bit shocked that it didn't have a bull's-eye on it,\" Burr said on the recording CNN said was made Saturday in Mooresville, about 30 miles north of Charlotte. Burr issued a statement of apology Monday afternoon shortly after CNN published the recording: \"The comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it.\" Ross said the remark was \"not befitting a senator.\" \"I think it's a comment about violence against a candidate for the president of the United States, and they're irresponsible and wrong,\" Ross said in a telephone interview Tuesday. Burr's comments normalize an attitude among some gun rights supporters that killing unfriendly politicians could be an option, Brady Campaign President Daniel Gross said Tuesday. The group advocates for gun control legislation and is named for James Brady, the Ronald Reagan aide wounded in an attempt to assassinate the president in 1981. \"We take from it a level of violent rhetoric that is dangerous and we need to say is unacceptable,\" Gross said in a telephone interview. A Burr spokesman did not respond to a request for further comment Tuesday. But the state Republican Party lashed out, with Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse repeating attacks on Ross for her work for the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and Clinton's email scandal. The audio obtained by CNN also captured Burr joining a handful of GOP senators who have said they would continue blocking nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court if Clinton is elected. \"If Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court,\" Burr said. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Arizona Sen. John McCain have also said the GOP will block any Democratic nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. President Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland for Scalia's seat in March. Senate Republicans declined to even hold hearings, insisting voters choosing the next president would have the final say. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Emery P.

    "text": "Email Last Updated Nov 1, 2016 5:55 PM EDT The day the original story about Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server broke, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta wrote to another top Clinton aide, Cheryl Mills, that the emails would have to be dealt with, and \u201cbetter to do so sooner than later.\u201d\u00a0 In the exchange , just before 11 p.m. on March 2, 2015, Podesta wrote to Mills, who served as Clinton\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department. The New York Times published its story about the existence of Clinton\u2019s private email account just hours beforehand.\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later,\u201d Podesta wrote. A Clinton campaign aide clarified that by \u201cdump,\u201d Podesta meant to release to the public\u2014like in a document dump\u2014and not deleting or getting rid of them. This email exchange was part of the latest batch of emails released by WikiLeaks\u2014the 25th such exchange since Oct. 7. The total number of emails now available from Podesta\u2019s account totals 41,969. Clinton turned over roughly 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department in December 2014\u2014before the story broke about her private server. Many of those pages have subsequently been reviewed and released to the public by the State Department. However, Clinton deleted an additional 33,000 emails because they were not work-related, she and her team have said. The issue is especially salient after the news last week that the FBI is investigating new material related to Clinton\u2019s email practices.\u00a0 The WikiLeaks dumps have shed light on the Clinton team\u2019s response to the ongoing situation with her private email practices, an issue that has plagued her campaign since its inception. For example, later in March 2015, Mills wrote to Podesta and other aides that they needed to \u201cclean this up\u201d when President Obama said he was unaware of Clinton\u2019s private email server until the news broke publicly. \u201cWe need to clean this up,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe has emails from her - they do not say state.gov.\u201d This article has been updated to clarify the characterization of the Podesta email. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Researchers with the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery , or TIGHAR, which runs the project, have found similarities between the famed pilot and the partial skeleton of a castaway discovered on an uninhabited Pacific island in 1940. Using modern techniques, forensic anthropologists and imaging experts compared measurements of the arm bones in the castaway's skeleton to a historical photo of Earhart and discovered that their measurements were \"virtually identical.\" While the discovery doesn't conclusively prove the bones are Earhart's, researchers say it could mean the famed pilot spent her final moments as a castaway. Related: Finding Amelia Earhart: New Expedition Could Solve Mystery Amelia Earhart was an aviation pioneer. In 1932, she became the first woman to complete a solo transatlantic flight. That year, she also became the first woman to fly solo from coast to coast. But it was her disappearance during her second attempt to fly around the world, in 1937, that has fascinated aviation enthusiasts for more than 70 years. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, departed from Miami in July 1937, heading east. But their plane, the Electra, disappeared about 800 miles into the flight, according to historians. A Coast Guard search was called off after two weeks. Related: Footage of Aviator Amelia Earhart Emerges 80 Years After Disappearance Researchers with The Earhart Project are dedicated to proving that the pilot made an emergency landing and eventually died on uninhabited Nikumaroro island, part of the western Pacific republic of Kiribati. TIGHAR researchers have previously tried to link a piece of aluminum sheeting and other evidence found on the island to Earhart's disappearance. Chelsea Bailey ",

    "text": "2016 The share of people without health insurance keeps falling. Since 2013, when the major provisions of Obamacare went into effect, the uninsured rate has fallen in every state. And some states that you might not expect have led the way. The news about the Affordable Care Act has been grim lately: The price of health plans in new marketplaces is up, and choice is declining in many places. But amid the difficulties, new data highlight the law\u2019s effectiveness in getting coverage for millions of Americans. Over all, the gains are substantial: a seven-percentage-point drop in the uninsured rate for adults. But there remain troublesome regional patterns. Many people in the South and the Southwest still don\u2019t have a reliable way to pay for health care, according to the new, detailed numbers from a pair of groups closely tracking enrollment efforts. Those patterns aren\u2019t an accident. As our maps show, many of the places with high uninsured rates had poor coverage before the Affordable Care Act passed. They tend to be states with widespread poverty and limited social safety nets. Look at Mississippi and Texas, for example. But many of the places that have reduced their uninsured rates the most had similar characteristics in 2013. Look at Kentucky and Arkansas. Over the years, you can see them diverge sharply from their neighbors. Reductions in the uninsured in 2014. One year after the health law\u2019s coverage expansion kicked in, millions of people got health insurance. Through 2015. In the second year, the uninsured rate continued to fall nationwide, with some states having especially sharp declines. Through this year. Guess which states expanded Medicaid? The differences reflect a number of factors, but there is one big one: a state\u2019s decision about whether to expand its Medicaid program. States that expanded saw much larger declines in their uninsured rates compared with those that didn\u2019t. It appears that Medicaid expansion has had a couple of effects: It provided a new coverage option for childless adults below or near the poverty line. It helped spur many people who were already eligible for the program to sign up. And it may have helped boost enrollment in Obamacare\u2019s marketplace plans. Take a look at Montana, which expanded its Medicaid program this year -- it experienced immediate, sharp reductions in the number of residents without insurance. (Louisiana also expanded its program this year, but the expansion began after the research used to make the map was conducted.) The numbers used to make our maps come from two organizations that are closely tracking the progress of the health law. For the last two years, Enroll America and Civis Analytics have shared with The Upshot the results of their research into where the uninsured live. They use the data to help identify people who may be eligible for coverage and need help signing up. The new marketplaces have struggled to attract a large share of young, healthy customers, which is part of why costs there have been higher than insurers expected. But the Enroll America data suggest that, over all, a lot of young people who had no insurance before have it now. Researchers measured a five-percentage-point drop in the uninsured rate among adults under 35 in 2016 alone. The Enroll analysis found that states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 showed big reductions, but states that expanded the next year caught up quickly. Those data suggest that states yet to expand could expect results similar to neighbors that made the policy change earlier. (For a glimpse of what the country might have looked like in 2014 if every state had expanded Medicaid, look at the map here .) \u201cThe states that expanded early, they obviously saw an immediate decline,\u201d said Ed Coleman, the national analytics and data director at Enroll America. \u201cBut the states that expanded late, they caught up almost right away. They get very immediate and dramatic benefits.\u201d Medicaid expansion is not the only way states have increased the number of residents with health insurance. One of the most striking trends in the three-year Enroll data is that many of the states with the largest reductions in the uninsured in 2014 also had the largest ones this year. West Virginia started near the bottom of the pack in 2013. It had high rates of uninsurance and poverty, and ranked low on measures of public health. But state officials, health care providers and local advocacy groups embraced the Affordable Care Act wholeheartedly -- and avoided the word Obamacare. The state didn\u2019t just expand Medicaid, but also took extra efforts to identify residents who were likely to be eligible for new insurance, sought them out, and made it easier for them to sign up. Even after the Medicaid expansion sharply reduced the state\u2019s uninsured rate in 2014, advocates like Terri Giles, the executive director of West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, continued to press for more people to sign up for health coverage. West Virginia is a red state, and opposition to the president\u2019s health law can run strong. But Ms. Giles said that she had faced little pushback as she\u2019s spoken to county officials around the state, encouraging them to help with sign-up efforts. \u201cAt first, we might have had some hesitancy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the proof is in the pudding, and the pudding is delicious in West Virginia.\u201d There\u2019s a governor\u2019s race this year in the state, but both candidates say they are committed to preserving the Medicaid expansion and other signup programs. Arkansas, another big success story, used some of the same automatic enrollment strategies. Kentucky gave residents a single, simple website to sign up for Medicaid or buy health insurance, though the new governor just shut down the site. California, a blue state, started early with Medicaid, and has focused on its insurance marketplace for middle-class residents, and has invested heavily in outreach to uninsured populations. Parts of the state still have a lot of uninsured residents, but the number has fallen every year. The numbers used in our maps and charts are based on a large survey combined with demographic and consumer data. For more detail on how Enroll makes its estimates, read our article on its methodology here . Because of the type of survey the researchers conducted, the Enroll estimates of the adult uninsured rate tend to be slightly lower than those from other sources, but the undercount appears to be consistent across areas and years. In areas with large populations of Native Americans, the uninsured rate does not fully capture the population\u2019s access to health care, since tribal members often get care from the Indian Health Service instead of traditional health insurance.

Got it At a rally in Dade City, Fla., Nov. 1, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton deplored how Republican rival Donald Trump has treated women like Alicia Machado. \u201cWe cannot hide from this,\u201d Clinton said. (Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post; Video: The Washington Post) By John Wagner , Jenna Johnson and Jose A. DelReal November 2 at 12:06 AM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @wpjenna Follow jdelreal DADE CITY, Fla. \u2014 Hillary Clinton and her allies on Tuesday intensified their attacks on Donald Trump\u2019s character and temperament, as they sought to shift scrutiny away from news that the FBI had revived an investigation into her email practices at the State Department. As part of that effort, Clinton made her most direct appeal yet for women to reject Trump\u2019s candidacy during a campaign stop in Dade City, where she recounted a litany of degrading remarks he made about women and referencing the allegations of unwanted sexual advances against him. Calling her Republican rival \u201csomeone who wants to bully us,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee was introduced at the rally by Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe whom Trump berated in the 1990s for gaining weight after she won the title. Machado \u2014 whom Trump again attacked after the first presidential debate \u2014 grew emotional while speaking about Trump\u2019s disparaging remarks and said she fought disorders in the subsequent years. [ Clinton\u2019s email trouble is a conversation starter for Republicans in tight races ] Later, in Sanford, Fla., Clinton blasted the GOP nominee for failing to pay federal incomes taxes and assuring he lacks the temperament to control the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. Trump, meanwhile, rebuffed those efforts by attacking her over the emails during a rally Tuesday in Eau Claire, Wis., saying that her election would provoke an \u201cunprecedented constitutional crisis.\u201d Trump said a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring work in Washington to an \u201cunglorious halt\u201d and called the email controversy the \u201cbiggest scandal since Watergate.\u201d \u201cShe is likely to be under investigation for many years, probably concluding in a very large-scale criminal trial,\u201d Trump said. The crowd at Trump\u2019s rally erupted into chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at several points through the speech. News that the FBI is renewing its probe into the potential mishandling of classified material in Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state has roiled the closing days of the 201 presidential contest, and many public surveys show the race has tightened. No evidence of criminal wrongdoing into Clinton\u2019s tenure at State has been discovered by the FBI or in several Republican congressional investigations. Earlier in the day, during a campaign event in King of Prussia, Pa., Trump focused his remarks at the Affordable Care Act and again promised to repeal President Obama\u2019s signature health-care law. \u201cWhen we win on November 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace,\u201d Trump said. (There appears to be no necessity for a \u201cspecial session\u201d on Capitol Hill. The current Congress will reconvene soon after the election. And early next year, the new one will gavel in.) [ Trump is back on script as the race tightens. Will that last? ] At a rally in Eau Claire, Wis., Nov. 1, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said \u201cthe work of government would grind to an unbelievably inglorious halt\u201d if his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton became president. (The Washington Post) But Trump shifted away from talking about health care in Wisconsin: \u201cYou know, somehow I think that Obamacare is not going to be her biggest problem. Does that make sense?\u201d Trump quipped in Wisconsin. \u201cShe wants to blame everybody else for her mounting legal troubles, but really she doesn\u2019t have anyone to blame but herself.\u201d Looking toward Election Day, the Clinton campaign is seeking to shore up support in several states where she had maintained comfortable margins so far. While Clinton\u2019s schedule in coming days is focused mainly to battleground states where polls have been close, the campaign announced Tuesday that she would be visiting Michigan later this week \u2014 an announcement which raised questions about her strength in a state she is largely expected to win. Democrats said Clinton is not overly concerned about the state but is trying to shore up support in the Detroit area as a precaution. (Clinton has been leading in recent polls by 7 percent there, according to the RealClearPolitics average and in 2012, President Obama pulled away in the closing week and won the state by nearly 10 percentage points.) The Clinton campaign deployed reinforcements throughout battleground states Tuesday, where Trump\u2019s temperament and character remained at the center of their speeches. President Obama himself held an event on Clinton\u2019s behalf on Tuesday \u2014 part of an all-hands-on-deck roster of high-profile surrogates including Vice President Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former president Bill Clinton. Obama took sharp aim at Trump\u2019s temperament during his speech in Columbus, Ohio, calling into question whether Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior made him fit to be commander in chief. Addressing men specifically, the president asked the crowd to consider the role that sexism may play in the election. \u201cI want you to think about it because she is so much better qualified than the other guy. She has conducted herself so much better in public life than the other guy,\u201d Obama said. He also said that Trump had shown no interest in working people before entering the presidential race. \u201cThe notion that this guy is your champion, the notion that this guy is going to fight for working people, when his entire life he didn\u2019t have time for anybody who wasn\u2019t rich or a celebrity, who wouldn\u2019t let you get into one of his hotels unless you were cleaning the room,\u201d Obama said, \u201cCome on. This guy is going to be your champion?\u201d Clinton spoke at length in Dade City about the allegations against Trump and said that he has revealed himself to have little respect for women by \u201cdemeaning, degrading, insulting and assaulting\u201d them. She said that Trump\u2019s comments and the accusations have brought back \u201cpainful\u201d memories of similar experiences for women across the country. \u201cLook at what he does. He calls women ugly, disgusting, nasty, all the time. He calls women pigs, rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10,\u201d Clinton told told the crowd. At one point, she detailed accusations from former beauty pageant contestants that Trump would walk into the dressing rooms to \u201cinspect them.\u201d \u201cNow, as bad as that is, he didn\u2019t just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant, he\u2019s also been accused of doing this at the Miss Teen USA pageant,\u201d Clinton told the crowd. \u201cWe cannot hide from this. We\u2019ve got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America!\u201d [ Clinton: Trump has been \u2018degrading, insulting and assaulting\u2019 women for 30 years ] How Trump treats women became a heated campaign issue last month, when an 11-year-old recording surfaced in which he made lewd comments and claims about women. Trump dismissed the recording, calling it \u201clocker room talk.\u201d But since the tape surfaced, 12 women have come forward claiming the billionaire had made unwanted sexual advances upon them. Trump has repeatedly denied those charges, and he has raised the sexual exploits of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton\u2019s efforts to protect his political future as a political counter-argument. During an evening rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a man carrying a sign sought to interrupt Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech and began to shout, \u201cBill Clinton is a rapist!\u201d Apparently in response, she offered an indictment of Trump and his supporters. \u201cI am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, we are going forward into a brighter future.\u201d She added that the issue of how women are treated could have implications well beyond the election. \u201cI want all the girls in America to know you are valuable, you should feel good about yourselves,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cDon\u2019t let somebody like this bully tell you otherwise. And I want to say to all the young boys, show respect because that shows you are real man.\u201d The Clinton campaign released a new ad Tuesday featuring clips of Trump speaking about women in disparaging ways. Aides said the ad will air in eight targeted states, including Arizona, a heavily Republican state where Clinton is making a late play. Her campaign also plans to begin airing its first television ads of the general election in Michigan and New Mexico and will return to the airwaves in Virginia and Colorado after a months-long hiatus, a campaign official said. Recent polls have shown Clinton leading in those states. All four states will see a six-figure investment, according to a campaign official. Her campaign has raised a record-breaking $11.3 million online in the last 72 hours, according to a campaign official, money that could prove crucial down the stretch. \u201cThe Trump campaign claims their path to White House is through states like these but we\u2019re going to make sure those doors remain shut,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, Clinton\u2019s deputy national press secretary. [ Post-ABC Tracking Poll: Trump 46, Clinton 45, as Democratic enthusiasm dips ] In a statement, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, characterized the Clinton\u2019s new ad reservations as a defensive move. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that in the final week of this campaign it is actually the Clinton campaign being put on defense and being forced to start advertising in so-called \u2018blue states\u2019 to hold off Mr. Trump\u2019s surge in the polls, including two states the Clinton campaign boasted of having put away months ago,\u201d Miller said. The Trump campaign announced it was also investing $25 million in advertising across 12 states, including New Mexico and Michigan. But it did not say how much would go to each location. A Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll conducted Thursday through Sunday showed Trump at 46 percent and Clinton 45 percent in a four-way contest. The poll finds little shift in Clinton\u2019s overall support following news of the FBI\u2019s renewed look at her emails, but strong enthusiasm among her supporters fell behind Trump in combined Saturday and Sunday interviews. Clinton still leads Trump by an average of four points in Colorado, five points in Virginia, seven points in New Mexico, and seven points in Michigan according to RealClearPolitics. [ Election maps are telling you big lies about small things ] Speaking to reporters en route to Florida, a senior Clinton aide said that the campaign does not believe the renewed scrutiny by the FBI is hurting Clinton\u2019s standing in the polls. \u201cThe race has tightened the way that we thought it would tighten but \u2026 we do not see anything that would suggest that the FBI story is impacting our support,\u201d said the aide, who requested anonymity to speak more freely about campaign strategy. Asked why Clinton is spending so much time in Florida, the aide said: \u201cIt\u2019s a state that we think we\u2019ll win. It\u2019s a state that Trump has to win. \u2026 Obviously we don\u2019t think he has any path without Florida.\u201d Wagner reported from Dade City, Fla.; DelReal reported from Washington.

Abdeljalil Bounhar/AP hide caption toggle caption Abdeljalil Bounhar/AP A Moroccan shouts as huge crowds in Rabat on Tuesday protest over a fishmonger's death in the northern city of al-Hoceima. Abdeljalil Bounhar/AP The violent death of a fish-seller sparked mass protests this weekend in Morocco \u2014 a rare show of dissent for the North African monarchy. Now, Moroccan authorities have arrested 11 people in connection with fish-seller Mouhcine Fikri's demise on charges of \"involuntary manslaughter and forgery of public documents,\" as the BBC reports . NPR's Jane Arraf walks us through what happened to Fikri: \"Police in the northern town of al-Hoceima confiscated fish that was being sold by a 31-year-old man, Mouhcine Fikri. He was reported to be selling swordfish, which is protected from fishing this time of year. So according to local media reports, when police threw all of his fish into a garbage truck, he actually jumped in after it and he basically was crushed to death in the compactor.\" Activists and witnesses \"had said that a local police officer ordered the garbage truck driver to start the compactor and 'grind him' \" \u2014 a phrase that later became a trending hashtag in the country, as The Associated Press reports. Grisly images of Fikri's body circulated widely online. Article continues after sponsorship A statement from the prosecutor said that \"there was no order (given) to assault the victim,\" the wire service adds. Five local officials from the town where Fikri died were among those arrested, according to the BBC. The AP says that \"the alleged forgery concerns the paperwork involved in destroying the fish.\" Two days after Fikri's death, King Mohammed VI ordered the interior minister to visit his family to offer condolences and vow to punish those responsible, the Moroccan state news service MAP reports . \"Mouhcine Fikri has become a metaphor for the little guy who is literally crushed by the system,\" Jane reports. Morocco Boasts Stability, But Critics Say The Price Is High His gruesome death and the subsequent protests have drawn comparisons to the death of Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian fruit vendor who set himself on fire in 2010 after a humiliating encounter with a police officer. Bouazizi's death ignited protests in Tunisia that ushered in a pattern of mass demonstrations across the region now widely referred to as the \"Arab Spring.\" However, as Jane notes, the political landscape is very different today than it was almost six years ago. Now, people across the region look at conflict-torn places such as Iraq and Syria, Jane says, \"and they see those countries being ripped apart and a lot of them are thinking, 'OK, things aren't so great here but it could get a whole lot worse.' \" Morocco, in particular, has been relatively stable compared with much of the region. Reporting from Morocco earlier this year , NPR's Leila Fadel explained why: \"It's not that Morocco wasn't touched by the Arab uprisings that swept through the region in 2011. Moroccans protested and demanded greater freedom. \"But in keeping with a trend throughout the Arab world, Morocco and other monarchies maintained tight control and the kings have all survived. In contrast, authoritarian leaders with no claims to royalty were ousted in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Yemen, while Syria remains locked in a nasty civil war. \"Morocco's King Mohamed VI promised significant reforms, and the country now has a new constitution. Morocco had elections and the protests stopped.\" Protesters wave the Amazigh (Berber) flag as they shout slogans in the northern city of al-Hoceima on Sunday after the death of Mouhcine Fikri.

    "text": "By Amy Norton HealthDay November 1, 2016, 6:22 PM Big money spent marketing unhealthy baby, toddler foods HealthDay Email Ads for baby and toddler foods often go against the nutritional advice of health experts, a new study shows. Researchers found that in 2015 companies spent $77 million in the United States on marketing infant formula, baby food, and food and beverages for toddlers. The good news, the researchers said, is that the majority of those products were nutritious choices, such as pureed fruits and vegetables , whole grains and dairy products. The bad news, they added, is that a large share of companies\u2019 marketing dollars -- almost 60 percent -- went toward products that are not recommended for most young children. That included sugar-sweetened \u201ctoddler milk,\u201d snack foods low in nutrients, and high-calorie liquid supplements like PediaSure. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to make parents anxious about finicky eating and send them the message that their child might need these products,\u201d said lead researcher Jennifer Harris, of the University of Connecticut\u2019s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. There is a place for liquid supplements and toddler milk, Harris noted. But only a small number of youngsters can benefit from them, she said. Angela Lemond, a registered dietitian nutritionist who specializes in pediatric nutrition, agreed, saying, \u201cMost children do not need them.\u201d Lemond, who was not involved in the study, is also a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. She said that toddler milks -- which are fortified with vitamins and minerals -- can be useful for toddlers with medical conditions that keep them from getting enough solid food, for instance. And those with \u201cfailure to thrive\u201d -- poor weight gain and growth -- may need a high-calorie supplement like PediaSure, Lemond added. But if parents have questions about whether their child needs any special food, they should talk to their pediatrician first, she said. \u201cDo not get advice from food marketing,\u201d Lemond said. \u201cGet it from your health-care provider.\u201d According to Harris\u2019s team, just three companies accounted for nearly all of the $77 million spent marketing baby and toddler foods in 2015 -- mainly through TV and magazine ads. Many of the products they marketed were wholesome. But the concern, Harris said, is the large chunk of money companies spent on toddler milk, liquid supplements and snacks like cookies, cereal bars and \u201cpuffs.\u201d All have added sugar -- and, in the case of the snack foods, few nutrients. Plus, Harris said, many products carried misleading messages like \u201cbrain-nourishing\u201d -- which implies they have health benefits that are actually unproven. Three brands -- PediaSure and two toddler milks -- spent about $16 million on Spanish-language TV ads, according to Harris. And all three spent more in 2015 versus a few years earlier. \u201cOnly products with added sugar were being advertised on Spanish-language TV,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThat\u2019s concerning because Hispanic children have higher rates of overweight and obesity .\u201d A spokesperson for Abbott Nutrition, the maker of PediaSure, said that the product is not marketed for \u201call children.\u201d \u201cIt is recommended for use by children over 2 years old who are behind in growth and struggling to meet the height and weight recommendations for their age,\u201d said Susan Oguche. Lemond said that parents should keep a few general points in mind. One is that, for the first year of life, breast milk is the \u201cgold standard\u201d liquid nutrition. After that, most toddlers will do fine with cow\u2019s milk and solid food. By age 2, Lemond said, children should get most of their calories from regular \u201ctable foods.\u201d \u201cWhole foods with minimal processing is best for all ages,\u201d she added. Harris said that toddlers should be exposed to a variety of foods, including vegetables , fruit, grains and dairy. And, she noted, parents should remember that it can take time for a child to acquire a taste for some foods, particularly vegetables. Finicky eating, Harris said, is nearly universal in the toddler set. It does not mean your child needs special drinks and supplements. \u201cWhen they\u2019re 2 years old, they can just be eating what the rest of the family is eating,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need special \u2018toddler\u2019 foods. That\u2019s cheaper for families, too.\u201d The findings were to be presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association in Denver. Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until peer-reviewed for publication in a medical journal. \u00a9 2016 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

The biologists trapped New Mexico meadow jumping mice and collected fur and fecal samples during summertime surveys in the southern Lincoln National Forest, the northern Santa Fe National Forest and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests along the New Mexico-Arizona border, Beth Humphrey, a district ranger with the U.S. Forest Service, said Tuesday. With a tail that makes up for most of its length, the rodent is called a jumping mouse because it can leap more than 2 feet into the air when frightened. Super-long tails help the mice keep their balance, especially when they scale plant stems to reach ripening seeds, one their main food sources. The New Mexico meadow jumping mouse was listed as an endangered species in 2014, prompting the U.S. Forest Service to fence off streams and watering holes in the Lincoln and Santa Fe forests to protect habitat thought to be ideal. That spurred criticism from ranchers and others that the federal government was trampling private access to public lands in New Mexico. Small populations of New Mexico meadow jumping mice have been found previously in New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. ",

    "text": "Child Dies as Health Authorities Confirm 2 Cases of Rare Neurological Illness By Gillian Mohney Nov 1, 2016, 3:15 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH 8 Children Hospitalized for Possible Rare Nervous System Disorder 0 Shares Email Two children have been diagnosed with a rare neurological condition called acute flaccid myelitis, which can lead to paralysis, the Washington State Department of Health said today. At least nine cases have been identified as part of a potential cluster of AFM cases, including the two confirmed cases. One child, who died after developing neurological symptoms, has not been confirmed to have had developed AFM, according to the Washington State Department of Health. The children between the ages of 3 to 14 in Washington state were hospitalized at Seattle Children's Hospital after developing symptoms including weakness or loss of movement in one or more of their limbs. Five of the children were released from the hospital, three remain hospitalized and one died after developing the symptoms, the Washington State Department of Health said Monday. The family said the child died on Sunday. No link between any of the cases has been detected, according a spokeswoman for the Washington State Department of Health. Due to the nature of the symptoms, authorities are investigating if they have identified a cluster of AFM. The syndrome is a rare condition that is not contagious on its own and affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord. It can occur due to various causes including viral infections. Since AFM is often caused by a variety of viruses, officials are looking to see if any viral infections in the area may have led to the cluster. CDC officials said today that they are \"concerned about the increase in cases in recent months.\" Since the start of this year through September, there have been 89 cases of AFM in 33 states, according to the CDC. In 2015, there were just 50 cases. In 2014, 120 cases of AFM were reported throughout the U.S. between August and December. At the time, the CDC and other health agencies were investigating the enterovirus D68. Fighting Zika With GMO Mosquitoes Could Be the Future of Mosquito Control Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the goal will be to definitively diagnose the children with AFM and then search for a potential cause. \"The first thing the investigators will do, they will look at clinical records to see if they fit the CDC definition of AFM,\" Schaffner said. \"They will simultaneously go to all of these patients and make sure that they have the best possible specimens to be sent to lab to establish viral diagnosis.\" If the child who died had signs of viral infection, it may help the CDC figure out if other children are at risk for developing AFM, Schaffner said. \"They will look to see if they find evidence of the virus in the nervous tissue,\" Schaffner explained. In 2014, dozens of children developed AFM around the time an outbreak of a respiratory virus called enterovirus D68 started to spread through the country. In general, certain enteroviruses, such as the polio virus, increase the risk that patients will develop AFM. However, after the 2014 enterovirus D68 outbreak, the CDC has not \"consistently detected a pathogen\" in the spinal fluid of infected patients that linked the virus to AFM cases. 0 Shares ",

There were no children on the school bus. Police say the crash occurred around 7 a.m. when a school bus struck the rear of a Ford Mustang, then a pillar and veered into oncoming traffic, striking a Maryland Transit Administration bus. The entire driver's side of the MTA bus was torn off, Baltimore Police Spokesman T.J. Smith said at a news conference this morning. \"It looks like a bomb exploded,\" Smith added. LIVE on #Periscope : Multiple Fatal crash briefing Frederick Ave. #Baltimore https://t.co/0OqFJQceoY \u2014 Baltimore Police (@BaltimorePolice) November 1, 2016 Police said there were at least five fatalities on the MTA bus. The driver of the school bus was also killed. There were 13 people on the MTA bus and two on the school bus, Smith said. Four patients were being treated at the University of Maryland Medical Center, including one who was in critical condition in the shock trauma center, a spokesman told ABC News. Niles Ford of the Baltimore Fire Department described a challenging scene for emergency responders. He said rescue workers had to cut out seats of at least one of the buses to gain access to the front. As of 9:50 a.m. this morning, emergency personnel were still working their way through the MTA bus, Ford said. It was unclear how fast the vehicles were traveling. Gov. Larry Hogan released a statement after the crash. \"The First Lady and I are deeply saddened to hear of the horrific crash this morning in Southwest Baltimore involving a school bus and an MTA commuter bus,\" the statement read. \"Our deepest condolences go out to the victims and their families in the wake of this tragedy. We will continue to pray for those who were injured, including the individuals in Shock Trauma, as well as the first responders who worked swiftly and continue to care for the injured. Our administration gives our full support to the Baltimore City Police Department as they investigate, and we are prepared to offer any state assistance necessary.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Ballot measures would legalize pot, end death penalty, create single-payer health care By Steven Greenhut Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 While this year\u2019s explosive presidential politics have drowned out battles at the state level, voters across the country nevertheless face a daunting number of weighty ballot questions on\u00a0Nov. 8\u00a0\u2013 ranging from an effort to abolish the death penalty to one that would usher in a state-run health care system. Other states are jumping on the bandwagon of weighing marijuana legalization, while minimum-wage hikes, gun control and even a statewide plastic-bag ban are being put to voters. As usual, California leads in the number of\u00a0 statewide ballot measures with 17 , including ones that revisit two hot-button social issues from the past.\u00a0 At the top of the list are\u00a0 two competing measures regarding the death penalty \u00a0\u2013 one (Proposition 62) putting an end to it and replacing it with life without parole. The other (Proposition 66) puts time limits on appeals in an attempt to fast-track executions. If both measures get a majority, the one that receives the most \u201cyes\u201d votes wins. The fracas is reminiscent of the 1980s, when California voters bounced three sitting justices from the state Supreme Court because of their reluctance to implement the death penalty. California is also voting on\u00a0 Proposition 58 , which would allow public schools to restart controversial bilingual programs. The question dates back to a divisive battle in the 1990s over a system that taught immigrant children largely in their native languages, typically Spanish. The English for the Children campaign in 1998 mostly outlawed the practice and replaced it with English immersion. The ballot measure would reconsider that decision. In neighboring Nevada, voters are considering a far-reaching electricity deregulation measure known as\u00a0 Question 3 . If approved, it would insert language into the state constitution to require an \u201copen, competitive retail electricity market.\u201d Supporters see it as a way of breaking the public utility monopoly and jump-starting a marketplace filled with clean, alternative energy providers. Supporters include Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk. Opponents, mainly unions, depict it as a giveaway to billionaires. Meanwhile, as ObamaCare gets bad publicity for rapidly rising premiums, Colorado voters are being asked to approve ColoradoCare, which would finance a $36-billion \u201cuniversal healthcare\u201d system to cover almost all Coloradans, thus making the Rocky Mountain State the single-payer guinea pig for the nation. To do so,\u00a0 Amendment 69 \u00a0imposes a 10-percent payroll tax on employers, who would pay two-thirds of it, and employees, who would pay the remaining third. Voters in Democratic-leaning Oregon also are being asked to slap a tax increase \u2013 2.5 percent on gross sales in excess of $25 million \u2013 on some of the state\u2019s largest employers.\u00a0 Measure 97 \u00a0would be the largest tax increase in the state\u2019s history, something that would be applied to total sales rather than profits. Opponents say it would raise the cost of goods and services, on everything from gasoline purchases to groceries. Proponents say it would provide needed funds for healthcare, senior services and public education. Five states are considering the\u00a0 legalization of marijuana for recreational uses \u00a0(Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada).\u00a0 Polls show the measures leading in California, Maine and Massachusetts, but struggling in Arizona and Nevada. States that already have legalized recreational marijuana are Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. (The District of Columbia largely legalized pot possession and cultivation at home only.) Graphiq In California, the lieutenant governor has championed a gun-control measure (Proposition 63) that would require background checks to purchase ammunition. In Washington state, Initiative 1491 would allow courts to issue an\u00a0 \u201cextreme risk protection order\u201d \u00a0to ban weapons from people who family members of police claim to be a potential danger. Minimum-wage fights will play out on five state ballots . Arizona, Colorado and Maine voters will consider initiatives that would raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. Washington\u2019s minimum-wage measure would raise it to $13.50 by 2020 and mandate that many employers provide paid sick leave.\u00a0 In South Dakota , voters face a referendum on a law that would lower the minimum wage for under-18 workers from $8.50 an hour to $7.50 an hour \u2013 an effort supporters say would reduce teen unemployment. There are some odd twists, too. A California referendum ( Proposition 67 ) will let voters either approve or reject a new law that forbids stores from handing out single-use plastic bags and requires them to charge at least 10 cents for alternative bags. Annoyed at the role played by grocery stores, plastic-bag manufacturers backed\u00a0 Proposition 65 as payback . It would redirect proceeds from new-bag sales from the grocers to a state environmental fund. According to Ballotpedia , there are 160-plus measures on statewide ballots. If voters avert their glaze from Trump vs. Clinton, they\u2019ll find plenty of substantive issues worth researching. Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute.

    "text": "To fight childhood obesity, task force recommends screening all kids starting at age 6 Child on scale Radius TWC In a draft recommendation, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says all children ages 6 and older should be screened for obesity. In a draft recommendation, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says all children ages 6 and older should be screened for obesity. (Radius TWC) Karen Kaplan Contact Reporter The fight against childhood obesity should begin in doctors\u2019 offices with routine weight screening for all kids ages 6 and up, according to fresh\u00a0advice from health experts. Draft guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force urge pediatricians and other clinicians to check the body mass index of children and adolescents to identify patients who would benefit from weight counseling programs. These \u201ccomprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions\u201d have been shown to help participants change the trajectory of their weight gain, cutting their odds of a lifetime of obesity. For kids, the official definition of obesity is having a body mass index in the top 5% for one\u2019s age and gender, based on official growth charts. Ideally, that means only 5% of children and teens are obese. But in America today, 17% of kids have a BMI high enough to fit that description. (Another 32% are overweight, with a BMI that puts them between the top 5% and 15% on growth charts.) Children who are obese suffer health problems such as\u00a0asthma, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, insulin resistance and orthopedic issues. They are also more likely to develop psychological and mental health problems, according to research reviewed by the task force. Reducing childhood obesity would reduce the incidence of these medical issues. But the larger goal of screening is to make a dent in the number of obese children who become obese adults. Most obese teens \u2014\u00a0nearly 80%, according to long-term tracking studies \u2014\u00a0are on track to be obese when they grow up. Overall, childhood obesity has stabilized in the United States.\u00a0But rates are still climbing for certain groups of kids, such as Latino boys and African American girls. The task force also noted that the proportion of obese kids who qualify as severely obese is growing. The authors of the proposed guidelines are under no illusion that universal obesity screening will be a silver bullet. Even the best programs to modify kids\u2019 behavior resulted in only a \u201cmoderate\u201d benefit, they wrote. But the downside risks of screening are \u201csmall to none,\u201d they wrote. The types of programs that work involve at least 26 hours of counseling over several weeks or months. The more hours involved, the better the results. Successful programs reviewed by the task force included counseling sessions not just for children who were obese but for parents and other family members as well. They taught patients how to improve their eating habits, including the importance of reading labels on packaged foods. They showed patients ways to exercise safely. They taught kids to keep tempting treats out of sight (and out of mind). And they helped them learn how to set goals for themselves, and monitor their progress toward reaching them. In 16 clinical trials that tested these programs, most participants gained no more than 5 pounds while growing in height, leading to lower BMIs. Meanwhile, patients assigned to control groups gained up to 17 pounds. On the psychological side, the programs resulted in small improvements in self-esteem, mental health and quality of life. The changes were too small to be statistically significant. The task force also considered the pros and cons of two medications \u2014\u00a0metformin and orlistat \u2014\u00a0that are sometimes prescribed to help kids lose weight. In clinical trials, both drugs helped patients lose a little weight. But the amount \u2014\u00a0on the order of 5 to 7 pounds \u2014\u00a0was too small for doctors to be sure it would make a real difference for patients. Against that modest benefit, studies found that orlistat (sold under the brand names Xenical and Alli) frequently caused side effects such as\u00a0abdominal pain, cramps, oily stools and fecal incontinence. In the end, the task force decided to recommend only behavioral interventions for weight loss. The panel did not consider bariatric surgery, noting that any patient heavy enough to be a candidate could be identified without screening. The proposed\u00a0guidelines were released Tuesday. Members of the public may comment on them until Nov. 28.\u00a0 Caption Rosetta's last mission The European Space Agency's Rosetta orbiter will commit operational suicide early Friday morning, but first it has just a little bit more science to do.

    "text": "By James Hohmann November 1 at 9:44 AM Follow @JamesHohmann Leticia Nieves, a paid canvasser for the Center for Community Change Action, knocks on doors in the suburbs of Orlando to urge Latinos who do not typically vote to come out for Hillary Clinton. (Photo by James Hohmann) With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: KISSIMMEE, Fla. \u2014 Barack Obama narrowly won Florida in 2012 by expanding the electorate. Hillary Clinton, with help from her allies, is trying to do that again in 2016. Indicators on the ground and in the early ballot numbers suggest that many low-frequency voters, particularly Latinos, will participate in this year\u2019s election. Every poll shows that the Sunshine State, which gave the country Bush v. Gore, is once again within the margin of error. The president carried the state four years ago by less than one\u00a0percentage point. Donald Trump, who has been relatively strong in Florida all year, needs the state\u2019s 29 electoral votes in any realistic scenario that gets him to 270. The attention being paid to the state reflects its special, quadrennial importance: Clinton rallies today in Tampa, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. Trump has events scheduled tomorrow in Miami, Orlando, Pensacola and then, on Thursday morning, in Jacksonville. Pro-Clinton forces undeniably have a better ground game than pro-Trump forces, which were slow to ramp up. It is helpful to think of get-out-the-vote operations like a special teams unit in football. It will not win you the game if you\u2019re down a few touchdowns, but it can make the difference at the end of a close matchup. Right now, Clinton really just needs a field goal to block Trump\u2019s path to the presidency. But it\u2019s not totally clear how many yards she has to kick the ball. That is why the kind of canvassing work that Leticia Nieves is doing in this working-class suburb of Orlando could prove pivotal. Two months ago, the 37-year-old was unemployed and living in Mount Pocono, Pa., when she saw an ad offering $15 an hour to knock on doors in Florida. Now she is one of nearly 500 paid canvassers working in Florida for the Center for Community Change Action . The progressive group has spent the past four months targeting a very specific universe of 384,000 Florida Latinos. They are low-propensity voters who are likely to support Democrats. That means they are registered but have either never participated or only cast a ballot in one of the previous four elections (typically the presidential in either 2012 or 2008). Mobilization matters more right now than persuasion. This sign hangs\u00a0in the group's field office. (James Hohmann) I spent a shift shadowing Nieves, who was born in the Bronx and spent her teenage years in Puerto Rico, as she tried to convince about a hundred folks that they should vote in 2016. Speaking their native Spanish, she was an effective messenger \u2014\u00a0but it also seemed to be a surprisingly easy sell. Edgardo Casiano, a cable technician who is registered to vote but has not done so since moving to Florida, initially said he was supporting Trump when Nieves knocked on his door. His wife walked up from behind and smacked him on the arm. She told the visitors at her door that he was just joking around, and that they both support Clinton. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t vote for Hillary, I will divorce him! Seriously,\u201d said Marlin Colon, a Mary Kay beauty consultant, as their two kids watched TV in the living room. The conversation that followed with the 29-year-olds showed the value of these face-to-face encounters \u2014\u00a0and the challenges of mobilizing hard-to-reach voters. The husband said he would go online to vote early. Nieves had to explain that you cannot vote on the Internet but must do so in person. That surprised him. She told him exactly where he could go and talked about how easy it was. \u201cAnytime from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.,\u201d she said. Then the wife, who loves the idea of Clinton being the first woman president, spoke up to say she filled out paperwork with someone at the mall so she could vote, but she received a letter from the board of elections saying that her registration did not go through because the Social Security number on her form was invalid. She wondered if it was too late to vote this year. The canvasser gave her the website and phone number for the local elections office and urged her to follow up as soon as possible. Leticia Nieves knocks on 40 doors before allowing herself a drink of water at the start of her canvassing shift. It keeps her focused and motivated. (James Hohmann) And so it went for much of Nieves\u2019s six hours at the door last Friday, from 2 p.m. until nearly 8 p.m. These low-propensity voters were incredibly enthusiastic about voting, but they often did not know basic information about how or where to do it. She explained patiently the requirement to bring a photo ID and why it is important to not just vote for the presidential candidates but also in the U.S. Senate race. Many of the conversations were in Spanglish. Past a Honduran pupuseria and a Dollar Store, in a modest subdivision of single-family homes, one middle-aged woman hesitantly cracked open her door. Suspiciously eyeing her visitors, she asked: \u201cAre you a Democrat?\u201d When Nieves said yes, the door opened wide and the woman smiled broadly. She said she already voted for Clinton. Then she fretted that her 27-year-old daughter does not see the point. \u201cWe need to push her because she is lazy,\u201d her mother said with a sigh. \u201cSo lazy!\u201d She promised that she would keep nagging her daughter, who still lives at home, until she votes. Nieves next persuaded a man named Jos\u00e9, who works in the service industry, to vote early. He said he would go on Tuesday, his day off. A few houses later, a man who has not voted since the 2008 election said he will definitely vote for Clinton. \u201cIf I opened the garage, you\u2019d see a bumper sticker for Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cNo Trump, no Trump, no Trump,\u201d an apron-clad woman named Consuela, who was preparing a dinner of chicken and chickpeas for her grandchildren, said on the next block. An Ecuadoran immigrant in her late 70s answered the door in a bathrobe. \u201cYou can leave whatever you want as long as it is not for that crazy loon,\u201d she said in Spanish, referring to Trump, when she saw the pile of political brochures in Nieves\u2019s hand. \u201cI am for Hillary,\u201d the canvasser replied. Then the woman\u2019s husband, Humberto Nunes, came to the door and heard the pitch. The couple agreed to go vote for Clinton and Senate candidate Patrick Murphy first thing the next morning.

It\u2019s next to a gold buyer's shop and shares a parking lot with a mini-golf course. (James Hohmann) -- The influx of Latinos into the Orlando area has been dramatic. Kissimmee is in Osceola County. In 2004, George W. Bush beat John Kerry in this county by five\u00a0points. In 2012, Obama crushed Mitt Romney by 25 points. Many Puerto Ricans fleeing the debt crisis in the U.S. territory have settled here. They are already American citizens so can easily register to vote in Florida. The state\u2019s Puerto Rican population, in excess of 1 million people, has doubled over 15 years. Experts say 1,000 new Puerto Rican families are resettling in the state every month. Kissimmee is in Alan Grayson\u2019s House district. Grayson vacated the seat to unsuccessfully seek the Democratic nomination for Senate. He threw his support behind his wife in the open primary to succeed him, but she lost to a Puerto Rican state senator. It is just the latest way that an emerging community is flexing its muscle. -- Various efforts to register new voters have already paid off for the left. Only 45 percent of the 493,000 people who have registered to vote in Florida since the start of August are white. Democrats expanded their voter registration advantage by almost 70,000 over the course of the summer, so they go into this election with a 327,000 registration advantage statewide. -- A surprising number of low-propensity voters have voted early so far. About 3.73 million ballots have already been cast in Florida, compared to a total of 8.5 million votes that were cast in 2012, including on Election Day. More than 400,000 of the registered Democrats who have voted early have either not voted in the past three elections or voted just once. Among Republicans, that number is 336,000. Of the nearly 200,000 registered Hispanic Democrats who have already voted, 50 percent fall into that category. Through the weekend, 70 percent of early voters have been white, compared to 14 percent Hispanic and 11 percent African American. (Hispanics account for about 16 percent of Florida\u2019s registered voters.) Mobilizing the voters who are with you is far more important than persuading new ones to support you at this point. \u201cThis is a state all about managing these micro margins,\u201d said Steve Schale, a Tallahassee-based operative who directed Obama\u2019s efforts in Florida and has been crunching these numbers every day. \u201cShe has a one-point to 1.5-point demographic advantage built in. The blocking and tackling at the doors \u2026 is where we are at in this election. It\u2019s a huge funnel of people. You\u2019re just trying to get as many people out of the bottom as possible.\u201d -- The Florida canvassers with Center for Community Change Action have faced off with humidity and Hurricane Matthew. When the Zika virus became a problem, the door knockers who work out of the three offices in Miami-Dade County\u00a0got extra rations of mosquito repellant. They have learned many lessons during four months on the ground. When they first started knocking on doors in June, the walkers carried fliers that included a big picture of Trump. It was an unflattering image, but they discovered that it made the Hispanics less likely to engage. Seeing the picture and not speaking English, they assumed the people coming to their door were representatives from the Trump campaign. Trump\u2019s image now does not appear in any of their materials. Nieves said she was chased by dogs in one development recently. In another, someone anonymously called the cops on her. Organizers are advised not to wear black, gold or red \u2014\u00a0to avoid being mistaken as somehow affiliated with area street gangs. She goes with the noncontroversial color gray. -- CCCA has similar, but smaller, programs to drive low-propensity turnout in Nevada and Colorado. Using the most sophisticated social science research on social pressure, the group is experimenting with various efforts to make sure these voters follow through when they commit to vote. During phone banks, canvassers do what they call \u201ccatch-and-release calls.\u201d If someone agrees to vote, they are asked to record a brief message about why it is important. Before Election Day, they receive an automated call and the message is replayed to them. Mailers are going out in the days before the election that detail their voting history in comparison to their neighbors. This makes people uncomfortable, but it is effective. \u201cMost campaigns don\u2019t want to invest the money to get the hardest voters,\u201d said Chris Torres, the national campaign director for the group\u2019s Immigrant Voter Project. \u201cEverything we\u2019re doing is additive to what the campaign is going to be doing.\u201d Hillary Clinton campaigns in Cleveland yesterday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) -- The Clinton campaign, which cannot coordinate with these groups, has carefully customized its own pitch for Latinos.\u00a0Its\u00a0field office in Kissimmee opened in August and is full of bilingual staffers. You cannot listen to Spanish-language radio stations here without hearing ads from Clinton about Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis . The campaign took special care to get the accent of the narrator just right. (The speaker in Clinton\u2019s ad in Miami has a Cuban accent.) Trump has run no ads in Spanish. The communications team has also worked to pitch stories to Puerto Rican newspapers, in hopes that the people who have moved to Orlando still read their traditional news sources from San Juan. In places such as\u00a0Arizona and Nevada, which have large numbers of Mexican Americans, Clinton\u2019s ads emphasize Trump\u2019s promise to build a border wall. If you listen carefully, that\u2019s not part of the Clinton paid media in Florida. Puerto Ricans are already citizens, and the wall is not a concern for the Cuban community. But many are offended by other insensitive remarks Trump has made about the broader community. -- One week out from Election Day, a red flag for Brooklyn: Nationally, early voting has increased sharply among Hispanics \u2014\u00a0a sign that anti-Trump backlash will indeed materialize at the polls. \u201cBut African Americans are turning out in smaller numbers than they did with Obama on the ticket,\u201d Dave Weigel reports . \u201cEarly returns show a boost in turnout in heavily Latino counties and a decline in largely African American ones (in Florida). In a state such as Nevada, where Democrats are relying heavily on Latinos, early returns show they are voting in similar numbers as in 2012, boosting Democratic chances. But in battleground states such as Ohio where Democrats are counting on African Americans to put them over the top, they could be in trouble....\u201d Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter. With contributions from Elise Viebeck ( @eliseviebeck ). WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Donald Trump stumped alongside Bobby Knight in Grand Rapids, Mich., last night. (Nati Harnik/AP) -- \u201c Trump Used Legally Dubious Method to Avoid Paying Taxes ,\" by five reporters in the New York Times: \u201cTrump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire. \u2026 But newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the [IRS] would most likely declare it improper if he were audited.\u00a0Thanks to this one now-outlawed maneuver, Trump potentially escaped paying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes. Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents \u2026 said Mr. Trump\u2019s tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. \u2018Whatever loophole existed was not \u2018exploited\u2019 here, but stretched beyond any recognition,\u2019 said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\" President Obama and Michelle Obama react to a flash mob of dancers portraying zombies from Michael Jackson's \"Thriller.\" (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b The Obamas greeted a long trail of trick-or-treaters at their final White House Halloween party, donning sweaters and jeans as they uncharacteristically urged children to gorge on candy and (temporarily!) abandon healthy eating habits.

Clinton\u2019s team pulled ads in the state weeks ago. And George Mason Policy and Government dean Mark Rozell said Clinton\u2019s lead does not look commanding when put into historical context, noting that polling in recent off-year Senate and gubernatorial contests has overestimated Democrats\u2019 margin of victory. \u201cBottom line, Virginia is still in play,\u201d he said. -- An NBC-SurveyMonkey poll finds Clinton with a six-point national lead over Trump (47-41), holding steady since James Comey\u2019s announcement. -- A University of New Hampshire-WMUR poll shows Clinton up seven\u00a0in NEW HAMPSHIRE (46-39).

From\u00a0 Sari Horwitz, Tom Hamburger and Ellen Nakashima: \u201cThe department signaled that it now wants the politically charged investigation to follow standard procedures, including a strict limit on official comments about the probe and the provision of updates to Congress through routine channels.

Edgar Hoover\u2019s order to wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and use the tapes to try to drive the civil rights leader to suicide. \u2018The reason I do those things,\u2019 Mr. Comey [once said], \u2018is to ensure that we remember our mistakes and that we learn from them.\u2019 His point: The nation\u2019s leading law enforcement agency must preserve investigations from any taint of political motive or extralegal influence. So it may be especially painful to Mr. Comey that today \u2026 some critics and historians are comparing him to Hoover. The parallels to Hoover, who ran the F.B.I. and its predecessor from 1924 to 1972 as a fief that reflected his personal and political views, may be quite a stretch.

In that case, the acrimony of an angry campaign will carry into a new administration and a new Congress.\" -- The Post\u2019s Editorial Board urges voters to stay calm and, in a modified version of the Hippocratic Oath, do no further harm. \u201c[This] consists in large part of recalling what we already know: that Ms. Clinton, foolishly and arrogantly, ignored State Department guidelines and used a personal email server while working as secretary of state. That a thorough FBI investigation found no harm to national security in the practice, virtually no mishandling of classified information.\u2026 At this point, there is no reason to believe that new emails, if any, would be inconsistent with the story that has emerged. Meanwhile, here\u2019s something else we know: Mr. Trump is the least qualified and most dangerous major-party nominee for president in our lifetimes.... Nothing Mr. Comey said Friday changes that, either.\u201d -- \u00a0Richard\u00a0Nixon\u2019s former White House lawyer, John Dean, blasts\u00a0Trump for comparing the email scandal to Watergate:\u00a0\u201cWhatever mistakes Mrs. Clinton made, her actions bear no similarities whatsoever to Nixon\u2019s criminalization of his presidency, and his efforts to corrupt much of the executive branch,\u201d he writes in a New York Times op-ed .\u00a0\u201cTo compare them to Watergate is more than historical ignorance.\u201d -- Hillary must commit to preserving White House records if elected, argues Timothy Naftali, former director of the Nixon Presidential Library: \u201cShould she win, as it still seems likely she will, Mrs. Clinton ought to consider taking very public steps, very soon, to reassure Americans of her commitment to the protection of official records and transparency. No one wants to have to worry that some of her future White House electronic records will go missing,\u201d he writes in a Times op-ed. --\u00a0 The New York Times\u2019\u00a0Editorial Board \u00a0calls the news sadly fitting: \u201cIn an election that has featured the obliteration of one long-accepted political or social norm after another, it is sadly fitting that one of the final and perhaps most consequential acts was to undermine the American people\u2019s trust in the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agencies.\u201d -- The New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza \u00a0offers a counterpoint: \"What the anti-Comey arguments ignore is that if Lynch (and Obama) had maintained a more scrupulously non-partisan approach over the last two years, Comey perhaps would not have had to insert himself as publicly as he has in order to defend the FBI from allegations of political interference. Comey became the face of the investigation, to the public and to Congress, because his superiors \u2014 Obama and Lynch \u2014 could not. It\u2019s far better for the public to have this information now than after the election. Perhaps it\u2019s possible that this revelation will swing the election to Trump. But it seems highly unlikely. \u2026 Clinton is still favored to win, and, if she does, Comey will have done her a favor.\u201d WAPO\u00a0HIGHLIGHT: -- \u201c U.S. plans operation against Islamic State in Syria despite obstacles ,\u201d by Missy Ryan and Karen DeYoung: \u201cThe Obama administration is racing to settle questions that could scuttle a planned offensive against the Islamic State in the Syrian city of Raqqa that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has said will begin \u2018within weeks.\u2019 Senior administration officials have attributed the newly described urgency to Raqqa\u2019s symbolic role as the \u2018capital of the caliphate\u2019 claimed by the militants and intelligence indicating that it is the center of Islamic State planning for terrorist attacks in Europe and the U.S. But the officials acknowledged a wealth of problems that could derail the offensive, including the need to gather and train additional Syrian forces. More ominously, they cite the explosive dynamics between two allies: Turkey and Syrian Kurdish fighters, who form the bulk of the existing offensive force. \u2026 \u2018This is one of the situations in which we have contacts and influence over all the actors,\u2019 said one official. \u2018But we\u2019re not in perfect control.\u2019\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: This is the new National Review cover: Rubio voted for Trump: \u2014 Patricia Mazzei (@PatriciaMazzei) October 31, 2016 American Bridge jumped right on it: Marco Rubio courageously voted this morning for someone he describes as \"the most vulgar person ever to aspire to the presidency\u201d. #FLSen pic.twitter.com/Zb0I98OnHs \u2014 American Bridge (@American_Bridge) October 31, 2016 The Texas GOP depicted Clinton as a witch online: The Sierra Club and Al Franken painted Trump as a Halloween villain: It's Halloween.

Sources tell ABC News that despite calls from Clinton, top Democrats and some Republican leaders, the FBI is unlikely to release more information on the scope of the investigation until after Election Day . With seven days left to go until America votes, Trump's pitch to early voters for a redo appears to be a Hail Mary play. The Republican nominee has been hitting the Clinton email investigation hard, as well as possibly damaging emails disclosed by WikiLeaks from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta . In Wisconsin, voters have a right to three ballots. If they voted early or absentee, they may cancel their ballot if they think they made the wrong choice. Other states, like Pennsylvania and Michigan, have similar rules that allow for changes to be made. Minnesota also allows changes, but the deadline, one week before Election Day, has now passed. In Wisconsin, Trump was joined by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and state leaders like Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ron Johnson . Johnson has been in a tough re-election battle against the incumbent he beat six years ago, Russ Feingold . \"I hope you are all going to get out and vote for Ron,\" Trump told his supporters. 0 Shares ",

The Indians could win it all tonight -- or lose it all tomorrow. But the city is on a winning streak.\u00a0 Cleveland fans have adopted a new nickname for their oft-maligned hometown: Believeland. But it wasn\u2019t always so. In the past the Cleveland Indians have been lifted into the World Series, no doubt, thanks to the cookies baked for them by Sister Mary Assumpta ... Announcer Tom Hamilton is the voice of the Indians. To sum up the past five decades for sports fans here: \u201cA lot of frustration,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cA lot of broken hearts. And a lot of championships that seem to be lost in almost historical fashion.\u201d With the Indians possibly on the verge of the city\u2019s second championship in a year, Cleveland appears to have put its painful past behind it. But this resurrection isn\u2019t just happening in the realm of sports. Not so long ago, this city was down for the count. In the late 1970s, Cleveland\u00a0 became the first major city to default on its financial obligations since the Great Depression. Cleveland became the poster child for the declining Rust Belt. Richie Piiparinen teaches Population Dynamics\u00a0 at Cleveland State University. \u201cWe rose with industry and we died with industry,\u201d Piiparinen says. \u201cPsychically, we lost our identity.\u201d ",

Alnahdi and one of his best friends, Tommy Hutson, had hung out at some local bars that Friday evening. But on Saturday night, Hutson said he decided to stay home while his friend went out. Bars had just let out for the night as students wrapped up an evening of carousing. Tommy Hutson with his roommate Hussain Saeed Alnahdi. Courtesy Tommy Hutson But Alnahdi, a Saudi student attending the University of Wisconsin-Stout would never make it home. He was attacked and left bloodied in the street near Toppers Pizza, a restaurant in downtown Menomonie around 2 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) on Sunday, according to police. Alnahdi, 24, died on Monday from injuries he sustained during the attack. No arrests have been made and investigators are treating the incident as a homicide, the Menomonie Police Department said in a statement issued Monday. Hutson has thought a lot about their final night out together and the good times he once shared with a friend he described as someone who \"always had a smile on his face and and made an effort to put a smile on the face of others.\" Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, a student at University of Wisconsin-Stout, died after a weekend assault. Courtesy Tommy Hutson \"Everyone has cried themselves out at this point and we are trying to remember the good times,\" Hutson said. In his home country, Alnahdi's parents are distraught, said Abdul Rahman Kadi, president of the Saudi Students Association. He, too, is a friend in mourning and was there at the hospital the night Alnahdi died. He placed the painful phone call to Alnahdi's cousin and brother. Alnahdi's father was too distraught to come to the phone, Kadi said. Alnahdi's family has no relatives in the U.S., Kadi said. The Royal Consulate General Of Saudi Arabia in Houston told NBC New they are in touch with Alnahdi's family in his home country and has sent a staffer to Menomonie to learn more about the incident from authorities and help arrange transporting his body back to his family. \"We are in the process of appointing an attorney to help locate the attacker and to request the maximum punishment,\" the consulate said in a statement. \"This 24 year-old, self-sponsored student had decided to attend University of Wisconsin-Stout because he believed Menomonie is a safe town to live in. He had dreams of earning a degree to secure his future and support and family. We trust the authorities will find the offender, and we trust the American courts will ensure a just punishment.\" Detectives were still searching for a motive on Tuesday. Witnesses told police the assailant was a white male about six feet tall. \"The motivation of the offender is unknown at this time,\" Commander Todd Swartz of the Menomonie Police Department told NBC News. \"It can't be confirmed at this time whether this was a hate crime.\" And the university community where Alnahdi studied is searching for meaning in the death of a young man who a classmate described to NBC News as \"a quiet guy\". Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, a University of Wisconsin student, died from his injuries after being assaulted early Sunday on Oct. 30, 2016. University of Wisconsin-Stout Alnahdi was a junior majoring in business administration and had arrived at University of Wisconsin-Stout last year, school Chancellor Bob Meyer said in a statement. He was enrolled in the school's English as a Second Language Institute and waiting to be begin business classes, said Mark Fenton, program director of the university's business department. He'd transferred from the College of Technology at Buryidah in Saudi Arabia \u2014 a branch of the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation in that country. Michael Lee, the International Student Adviser at the university, told NBC News that Alnahdi \"was well-integrated in the student body and he was liked by all different students.\" He loved to go over to his friend's house and hang out, Ali Aldehami, a close friend told NBC News. Alnahdi was a \"a nice guy\" who lived off campus and was learning English, Aldehami said. The two friends always felt Menomonie was a small and safe town, he said. \"I've never seen an incident of this type,\" Aldehami said. The university community was similarly shocked. \"Our deepest sympathies, thoughts and prayers go out to Hussain's family in Buraydah, Saudi Arabia, and his friends at UW-Stout,\" Meyer's statement added. University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross also sought to offer solace to Alnahdi's family, friends and the broader college community. Bowman Tower on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Stout. UW Stout via Facebook \"It is difficult to find the right words in light of such of a tragedy, except to express our sorrow for all that knew Hussain,\" Cross said in a statement. The university community was reeling on Tuesday from the news of Alnahdi's death. International students hailing from 42 nations make up 4 percent of the University of Wisconsin Stout's population. The school has 140 students from Saudi Arabia. Ursula Murray Husted, an assistant professor in comic and sequential art at the University of Wisconsin- Stout told NBC News that while Alnahdi wasn't one of her students she taught many of his friends. \"I am busy working on getting my students to the counseling center today,\" she told NBC News. https://t.co/jOORHUfZoH We lost a bright spark yesterday to an act of senseless violence-Hussain Saeed Alnahdi didnt pass. He was stolen. \u2014 Ursula Murray Husted (@umurrayhusted) November 1, 2016 The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an advocacy organization that has tracked a rise in anti-Muslim crimes in neighboring Minnesota, said it is currently monitoring the situation. As for Hutson, he's trying to think about the guy with the ready smile who was \"very open and accepting\". The two became roommates in August of last year and a friendship quickly developed, Hutson said. When Alnahdi first moved in he could barely speak any English, but they were \"all amazed how fast he learned.\" And Hutson, and his other four roommates learned from him as well. \"He often considered myself and our other roommates as his family,\" Hutson said. \"He was there for us when we needed him most. He is one of the best friends I've ever had and life will be a little darker without him here to light it up. If I ever spoke to someone that thought negatively of Saudis or Muslims I would tell them they needed to speak to Hussain and they would feel differently. We came from different worlds, but he showed me every day how much we had in common. He was my brother and I'll never forget him.\" Emmanuelle Saliba ",

On Monday, Taylor described Harris as a good father who was hands-on and enjoyed time with his son. \"Based on everything that I knew that day, Ross must have left him in the car. That was the only thing that made sense. The only thing that clicked in my mind as even a remote possibility,\" she said Monday. \"He must have forgot.\" WSB-TV Cooper Harris is seen in this undated handout photo. Court documents state that Harris allegedly researched child deaths in hot cars before the incident. Charges in the indictment also refer to sexually explicit online exchanges from March 2014 through the day of Cooper's death that, prosecutors say, Harris had with an underage girl. Prosecutors argued that Harris wanted to be free of his family responsibilities and was having multiple online affairs, including with the girl. Defense attorneys say that Cooper's death was an accident and that Harris forgot his son was in the car. During cross-examination by prosecutors, Taylor testified that around 2008-09, Harris had confided in her that he had a problem with pornography. She stated that in 2010, she'd uncovered a \"message\" in which he was asking for a photograph of another female. Taylor said she and Harris received counseling during that time. Then around 2012-13, she said he confessed to looking at pornography again after he tried to hide his laptop screen from her. She said she was angry. \"It was like, 'OK, this is still an issue,'\" she testified today. She said the two were still attending counseling at the time. \"I was mad. I was disappointed,\" she said about that 2013 discovery. \"All of the things that I have felt throughout this trial.\" Taylor reiterated today during cross-examination that she did not know Harris was communicating with men and women in a sexual manner via Skype and Craigslist . She told prosecutor Chuck Boring that she had no idea that an 18-year-old with whom Harris was allegedly communicating had cut off contact with him the morning of Cooper's death. \"He [Harris] destroyed my life,\" Taylor said. \"I didn't know about these things. ... I would agree that was a part of his personality that he did not share with me.\" Harris faces eight charges: malice murder, two counts of felony murder, cruelty to children in the first degree, cruelty to children in the second degree, criminal attempt to commit a felony and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Stephen B.

Daily News 1:59 p.m. EDT November 2, 2016 Brian Lee Adams, 56, of Green Cove Springs (Photo: Clay County Sheriff's Office) Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this report misstated Brian Adams' potential prison term. A 56-year-old Florida man could face up to 12 years in prison on charges of continuing to collect more than $35,000 in benefits in his dead mother's name after burying her in the backyard of her home. Brian Lee Adams of Green Cove Springs, Fla., which is southwest of Jacksonville, has pleaded guilty to theft of government property and aggravated identity theft, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida reported. Adams faces a maximum penalty of 12 years in federal prison, including a mandatory two-year sentence for aggravated identity theft. A sentencing date has not yet been set. Adams told authorities that his mother had died of natural causes in July 2014, and\u00a0instead of telling anyone, Adams buried her in the backyard of her home, according to his plea agreement. Adams acknowledged to investigators that he had buried his mother after she died to continue collecting both her Social Security payments and a pension payment that she received monthly, federal officials said.

See how the investigation played out. USA TODAY NETWORK The FBI gave the Hillary Clinton campaign another unpleasant surprise Tuesday, this time releasing 129 pages of documents from a 2001 investigation into Bill Clinton's controversial presidential pardon of fugitive Marc Rich. The bureau initially released the heavily redacted files on Monday, but drew more attention to the documents in a tweet Tuesday. The Clinton team questioned the timing of the release, which comes one week before the election and just days after Director James Comey's stunning announcement that the FBI was looking into newly discovered emails related to its investigation of Hillary Clinton. William J. Clinton Foundation: This initial release consists of material from the FBI's files related to the Will... https://t.co/Y4nz3aRSmG \u2014 FBI Records Vault (@FBIRecordsVault) November 1, 2016 \"This initial release consists of material from the FBI's files related to the William J. Clinton Foundation, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization,\" reads a statement on the FBI records vault website . \"The bulk of these records come from a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich (1934-2013), aka Marcell David Reich, by President Clinton in 2001; it was closed in 2005. The material is heavily redacted due to personal privacy protections and grand jury secrecy rules.\" Rich, who died in 2013, was a financier who fled to Switzerland after being indicted on multiple federal charges, including tax evasion, in 1983. Clinton's motive for pardoning\u00a0Rich on his last day in office was questioned\u00a0because\u00a0Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, was a wealthy Democratic donor who made a $450,000 donation to\u00a0Clinton's presidential library foundation and more than $100,000 to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. In a statement, the FBI said that any material requested three or more times under the Freedom of Information Act is automatically made available to the public online on a \"first in, first out basis.\" \"Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd,\" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted before the FBI released its statement. \"Will the FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70?\" Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s? https://t.co/uJMMzX6rtI \u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 1, 2016 The FBI actually did release a file on Donald Trump's father, Fred, on Oct. 8. The bureau also tweeted a link to those documents, along with links to files from 20 other\u00a0cases \u2014 including\u00a0 the investigation into Hillary Clinton's\u00a0email server \u2014\u00a0from its Records Vault account on Sunday. Prior to that, the last tweet from that account was in October of 2015. David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Obama, said the document release is another case of the FBI intervening in the election. \"Whatever the reasoning\u00a0behind it, this latest release further brands the @FBI as the Federal Bureau of Intervention,\" Axelrod said in a tweet. \"It's a head-scratcher!\" Whatever the reasoning behind it, this latest release further brands the @FBI as the Federal Bureau of Intervention. It's a head-scratcher! \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) November 1, 2016 The majority of the pages in the documents are completely redacted and they do not appear to shed any new light on the case. Comey took over the FBI probe into the Rich pardon in 2003 and the case was closed in 2005 with no charges\u00a0filed. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

CBS Baltimore Email Last Updated Nov 1, 2016 11:17 AM EDT BALTIMORE -- A school bus blocks away from its first stop Tuesday morning rear-ended a car, hit the entrance to a cemetery and then veered into an oncoming commuter bus in a crash that killed at least six people and injured 10, authorities said. No children were on board the school bus, whose driver was killed along with at least five people on the Maryland Transit Administration bus, Baltimore Police spokesman T.J. Smith said. \u201cIt literally looks like a bomb exploded in the bus. It\u2019s catastrophic damage,\u201d Smith said. The only other occupant of the school bus, an aide, was taken to a hospital, as were the car driver and eight people from the commuter bus, Smith told a news conference. Their injuries ranged from minor to critical, he said. The school bus was on its way to pick up a child a few blocks away, CBS Baltimore reported . The school bus slammed into the MTA bus, crumpling both driver\u2019s areas, and then raked the side of the commuter bus, tearing off sheet metal. It finally came to a stop with its front end buried toward the back of the MTA bus. Smith noted a lack of skid marks at the crash scene on Frederick Avenue near Loudon Park Cemetery, leading to what he called a working theory that the school bus driver had suffered a medical emergency. #BPD confirm fatal bus ax started with this skid mark where a bus hit this car 1.5 blocks away from main impact #fatalbuscrash @cbsbaltimore pic.twitter.com/BbWr6DTVuz \u2014 Mike Schuh WJZ (@MikeWJZ) November 1, 2016 CBS Baltimore spoke with a witness who came upon the crash shortly after it happened. He described trying to free an injured woman before emergency workers arrived on the scene, saying there was glass all over her. He and another man lifted the front windshield off of her but they could not get her out of the bus. Firefighters were still working their way through the wreckage of the commuter bus about two hours after the 7 a.m. crash, Baltimore Fire Chief Niles Ford said. \u201cThis was a significant, significant wreck, so there are still portions of the bus that our people have not been able to fully access,\u201d Ford said. He said firefighters also had to enter the school bus from the rear and cut out the seats to reach the driver and aide. Smith characterized it as an accident investigation, not a crime-scene investigation, despite the presence of homicide detectives. Smith said they were called because they are accustomed to conducting death investigations. University of Maryland Medical Center spokeswoman Lisa Clough said the hospital received one patient in critical condition and four others in fair condition. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

USA TODAY Kerry Washington is Olivia Pop on ABC's 'Scandal.' (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC) When it comes to racial and ethnic diversity, compared to movies\u00a0TV is a rainbow coalition. This year's #OscarsSoWhite campaign targeted the film industry, but midway through the fall TV season, with all 20 new shows now airing, more than a third of the actors on major-network sitcoms and dramas are racially or ethnically diverse, according to USA TODAY research.\u00a0Eighteen\u00a0series have minority actors in lead roles, up from just six five years ago, with ABC and Fox leading the way. And more shows are highlighting diverse themes and experiences, not just sprinkling black, Latino or Asian-American actors into their casts. Based on our research, USA TODAY assigned each major network a letter grade based on the ethnic and racial makeup of scripted primetime fall 2016 series, the percentage of leading roles they represent and the prevalence of diverse themes in the shows.\u00a0( Click here to see why each network was assigned the grade it received.) ABC: A- TV's diversity report card: How we grade the major networks While TV executives are aware diversity is a hot-button issue,\u00a0their motives aren\u2019t entirely pure. We recognized pretty quickly this was not about social good, this was about good commerce,\u201d says Gary Newman, co-chairman of Fox Television Group. \u201cWhen you have a country as diverse as ours, you just have to have programming that appeals to different groups.\u201d\u202f Since\u00a0Empire\u00a0took off in early 2015, Fox has\u202f added\u00a0Rosewood, starring Morris Chestnut as a sexy coroner, and this fall\u2019s\u00a0Pitch,\u00a0Lethal Weapon\u00a0and\u00a0The Exorcist, each with black or Latino lead characters. \u201cPeople have begun to recognize how much money they can make by targeting underserved audiences,\u201d says Courtney A. Kemp, the creator and executive producer of Power, a popular Starz series about a black nightclub owner. \u201cThe color that\u2019s relevant here is green.\u202f It\u2019s not about any kind of altruism, or a sea change in how people are feeling about diversity.\u201d Instead, it reflects demographic shifts, and TV executives' need to chase viewers as Hollywood faces radical shifts in how and where they find their entertainment. \u00a0U.S. Census data projects the percentage of blacks, Hispanics and Asians will continue to grow in coming decades, while the percentage of whites declines. \u00a0And amid steadily declining ratings, blacks are among the most loyal viewers, watching\u00a0nearly 50% more TV each week than the general population, Nielsen says. Robert Bianco: Why TV needs diversity Whatever the cause, public advocacy groups are cheering the result. \u201cTV has done a really good job of having diverse representation, diverse storylines, whereas the movie studios, especially the Big 6, are light years behind,\u201d says Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty dramatic contrast.\u201d GLAAD's own study of 2016\u00a0found a record 36% of regular characters on broadcast shows were people of color, up from 33% last year and 22% in 2012.\u00a0Some cable and streaming networks have an equal or even better record, as more than 400\u00a0scripted series\u00a0in total dwarf\u00a0the volume of film releases,\u00a0creating\u00a0more opportunities. This fall alone saw the premieres of three critically acclaimed series \u2014 HBO's Insecure, FX's Atlanta and Netflix's Luke Cage \u2014\u00a0all featuring black stars and producers. Mike Colter stars in Marvel's 'Luke Cage' on Netflix. \u00a0(Photo: Myles Aronowitz, Netflix) But\u00a0across television, progress still lags behind the camera for writers, directors and producers, and\u00a0at some networks, in front of it. TV diversity still lags behind the scenes TV has tiptoed into\u00a0inclusivity\u00a0at least since the 1960s, when Diahann Carroll broke barriers playing\u00a0a professional nurse and\u00a0widowed mother\u00a0on NBC\u2019s Julia, and Nichelle Nichols co-starred as Lt.\u00a0Uhura\u00a0in Star Trek. In the 1970s, Norman Lear tapped the issue of race\u00a0in Good Times, The\u00a0Jeffersons\u00a0and Sanford and Son, and\u00a0Freddie\u00a0Prinze\u00a0was the co-star of Chico and the Man. A decade later, NBC's top-rated\u00a0Cosby Show presented a mainstream, upper middle-class black family, and later, early seasons\u00a0of Fox, WB and UPN had entire nights of black comedies aimed at establishing the startup networks. While reality shows have often embraced diversity, scripted series largely faded away from the major networks, which sought more\u00a0\"mainstream\" series, and migrated to niche channels.\u00a0Black,\u00a0Latino and gay characters\u00a0popped up\u00a0in ensemble casts as sidekicks and pals, in a pattern parodied by South Park\u2019s Token\u00a0character.\u00a0 \u201cAudiences were so happy\u00a0(just)\u00a0to see a diverse face on the screen,\u201d says Darnell Hunt, director\u00a0of UCLA\u2019s\u00a0Ralph J.\u00a0Bunche Center\u00a0of African-American Studies, that complaints were few. Five years ago, about the only diverse leads on primetime network sitcoms and dramas were\u00a0Kerry Washington (Scandal)\u00a0and\u00a0Mindy\u00a0Kaling (The\u00a0Mindy Project), both in their first seasons.\u00a0 But a new renaissance\u00a0--\u00a0 in which \u201cpeople of color are at the center, driving the narrative,\u201d Hunt\u00a0 says -- is\u00a0exemplified by\u00a0Fox\u2019s Empire, which proved there\u2019s a big audience of all types for a drama with an almost all-black cast: Now in its third season, Empire is the top-rated network series among young-adult viewers, and 63% of its audience is black. Jussie Smollett and Taraji P. Henson star in Fox's 'Empire.' \u00a0(Photo: Chuck Hodes, Fox) ABC \u2013 which last year named\u00a0Channing\u00a0Dungey\u00a0the first African-American\u00a0programming chief at a major network \u2013 has shows centered on gay, special-needs, African-American and Asian-American characters. The outlier is top-rated CBS: All six of its new fall series star\u00a0white men. \u201cOur goal is always to try to get more diverse,\u201d\u00a0programming chief Glenn Geller\u00a0said\u00a0in August. \u201cWe did not meet that goal this year in terms of leads\u201d \u2014 though the network hastily added several diverse supporting actors to ensemble casts. One business consideration: Sales to outlets overseas, a lucrative source of revenue, where shows like Empire have struggled. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to talk about it, but it\u2019s the flip\u00a0side of what we experience here,\u201d Newman says. \u201cA\u00a0lot of those\u00a0countries are not very diverse, so it\u2019s hard for shows like that to break through ...\u00a0If you do a show you feel isn\u2019t going to work internationally,\u00a0you have to be more cautious about budgets.\u201d Still, for many actors the chance to right previous wrongs makes motives irrelevant. And they welcome non-stereotypical portrayals in shows like\u00a0Cage, which cast diverse characters as \u00a0do-gooders rather than criminals. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t see too many positive heroes, American heroes, that looked like me on TV,\u201d says Corey Hawkins, who plays\u00a0the new\u00a0lead\u00a0on Fox\u2019s upcoming\u00a024\u00a0revival. If trends continue, that shouldn't be a problem in the years ahead. Contributing: Bill Keveney ",

On Tuesday, the campaign announced it was purchasing $25 million in TV ads for the final week in blue states like New Mexico and Michigan -- both of which Trump has visited in the last few days -- along with more obvious swing states like Ohio and Florida. They also are staying on the air in battleground states like Virginia and Colorado where the campaign has struggled to stay competitive in public polls. With one week to go, the question is whether this is a move borne out of strength or desperation. The Trump campaign has argued that the moves reflect their confidence that recent news of further FBI inquiry into emails by Clinton aide Huma Abedin obtained from an investigation into estranged husband Anthony Weiner has set the stage for a breakthrough. \"While Mr. Trump continues to climb in the polls and accelerate outreach in states like Michigan and New Mexico that are rarely won by Republican Presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton is preoccupied fighting the sitting FBI Director and President Obama over yet another email scandal,\" Trump's digital director Brad Parscale said in a statement announcing the buy. As Democrats and some Republicans were quick to note, though, there's a long tradition of campaigns behind in the polls making a last-second move into unusual states. \"I think it's a reflection of how weak his prospects are as opposed to any sign of strength,\" Mitch Stewart, who served as Obama's battleground director in the last presidential campaign. \"It reminds me of Romney making late plays in Michigan and Pennsylvania in 2012.\" Play Analysis: Where Does the Electoral College Map Stand? 1:06 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161102165040if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/798626883859\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Regardless of the motive, the Clinton campaign and its allies made clear they wouldn't let Trump push into states uncontested. On Tuesday, they announced six-figure buys in Michigan, New Mexico, Virginia, and Colorado. Priorities USA, a top Democratic super PAC, is also going on the air in Colorado, Michigan and Wisconsin, where the Clinton campaign recently bought ad time. \"The Trump campaign claims their path to White House is through states like these but we're going to make sure those doors remain shut,\" Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson said in a statement. State and national polling has been relatively scarce since the news of the FBI investigation broke. While there have been no substantive revelations concerning Clinton's use of a private account, the news of the new emails has fueled a partisan war over director James Comey's decision to make the discovery public. What we know so far about the political fallout is mixed: An NBC News| SurveyMonkey poll showed the race unchanged and Clinton holding a 6-point lead, but other polls show Trump gaining in recent days, even before the FBI story. And a Washington Post/ABC daily tracking poll even gave Trump a 1-point lead on Tuesday. Clinton still maintains a lead in national polling averages as well as key states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Colorado that would put her past the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. But Democrats have expressed some concern that the news may hurt them in key Senate races .

But a battleground map sent to supporters in a fundraising email on Tuesday showed New Mexico still blue, while Michigan was a \"toss up\" state. And it said that Trump was \"close\" in states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Colorado rather than winning. Trump campaign sources told NBC New that while the latest ad buy reflected improved polling in some states like New Mexico, the main purpose was to project confidence in the final days by going \"on offense\" rather than be portrayed as fighting to gain ground in existing battleground states. Jon Cavanagh, a pollster with Michigan-based EPIC-MRA, sounded confused by Trump's recent interest in the state given that surveys have consistently showed him down throughout the race by between 5 and 11 points. \"I'm not real sure what to make of it,\" he said. He noted an online poll by Fox 2 Detroit/Mitchell Poll conducted since the FBI news found Clinton up by 6, consistent with their findings the week before and polling averages of the state. New Mexico, where polling has been infrequent, may be even more of a reach thanks to its substantial Latino population. Trump's longstanding calls for a border wall and mass deportations have largely derailed outreach efforts and early vote patterns in several states already show a surge in Latino turnout . \"Trump pressing into those states now is the political equivalent of throwing a Hail Mary from his own five yard line,\" Republican pollster Chris Wilson said in an e-mail. \"For a Hail Mary to work, you have to have at least moved the ball down the field prior to the desperate throw.\" Play ",

    "text": "Governor Issues State of Emergency After Deadly Alabama Pipeline Blast By ENJOLI FRANCIS Nov 1, 2016, 6:03 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Deadly Explosion at Alabama Gasline 0 Shares Email Officials said today that it was too early to estimate how a deadly pipeline blast outside Birmingham, Ala., would affect the gas supply along the East Coast, as the governor announced a state of emergency in case of a shortage. On Monday, around 3 p.m., Colonial Pipeline Co. said that a nine-person crew was working on its gasoline pipeline No. 1 in Shelby County when a trackhoe struck the pipeline, causing a fire. Colonial said the team was conducting \"normal routine work\" related to pipeline repairs from a rupture and spill that had occurred a few miles away in September. One person was killed, five were injured and four remained hospitalized. The company said the families of the injured had asked that no information be released. \"This is a tragic accident. We had a contractor excavating over the top of a pipeline,\" Bill Barry, a Colonial representative, said today at a news conference. \"Exactly what happened, how it happened, whether there were steps that were missed -- these are all things we're going to be investigating over the course of the coming days and weeks. We will learn from this and we will apply corrective actions as appropriate to make sure that this never happens again.\" 1 Dead in Alabama Pipeline Explosion Colonial said pipeline No. 1 would be down till likely the weekend. A second pipeline carrying diesel fuel as well as aviation kerosene near the damaged pipeline was shut down but back up by 11 p.m. Monday. \"Our deepest condolences go out to the family and loved ones of the deceased, and our thoughts and prayers remain with the four individuals who were injured and who continue to receive care at area hospitals,\" Colonial Pipeline said in a statement today. Colonial operates around 5,500 miles of pipeline from Gulf Coast refineries to the New York Harbor. Company officials would not speculate on how the incident would affect the gas supply, noting that they first wanted to examine the damage and assess the necessary repairs. Gasoline futures in the US market ended up more than 4 percent today, reflecting the pipeline disruption. Courtesy Alabaster Fire Department/Handout via REUTERS First responders at the scene of Colonial Pipeline Co. explosion and fire in this Alabaster Fire Department photo in Shelby, Alabama, October 31, 2016. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley today issued a state of emergency, warning that there may be a temporary gas shortage in parts of Alabama. The announcement, he said, would help push through a waiver lifting the US government's limit on the number of hours a driver can transport gasoline. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration among other US agencies was investigating Monday's incident as well as the one in September. The Alabama Forestry Commission was also assisting by monitoring the wildfires within the containment lines. The fire from the pipeline was still burning but there was no impact to the quality of air, company officials said. 0 Shares ",

Program, check. Chance to see the Cubs keep their championship hopes alive in the World Series ? You bet. Cubs fans from across the country poured into Progressive Field in balmy downtown Cleveland on Tuesday night, decked head-to-toe in blue and clinging to hope that the North Siders have two road wins in them to snap a legendary title drought. With the night feeling more like June than the first day of November, Cubs fans settled into the ballpark amid the Indians faithful, another Series starved fan base that brushed aside the invaders from the west, trying to will the home team to a clinching win.

Many Cubs fans who made the trek to Ohio said they plan to stay in town, wanting the chance to see the team win a championship with their own eyes. Cubs fans at Game 6 John J.

Kim / Chicago Tribune) When Addison Russell connected for a third-inning grand slam, a horde of Cubs fans in the outfield grandstand erupted in wild celebration. One man in a Jake Arrieta jersey dropped to his knees on the patio concourse and extended his arms to the heavens. Chicago fans behind the Cubs dugout went wild, as did patches of visiting fans from the upper deck to the left field bleachers. Fans in Cubs blue appeared all over downtown Cleveland earlier in the day, packing the bars and restaurants on East 4th Street, just as many had done a week ago for Games 1 and 2. Fans in Kris Bryant and Ernie Banks jerseys strolled down Ontario Street, one of the city's main arteries, which links the hotel district to the ballpark. Mike Fischer made a decision while watching Game 5. \"If they go to a Game 6, we're going to Cleveland for my old man,\" he said. Fischer bought the tickets \u2014 $900 apiece \u2014 then texted his dad: \"Pack your bags.\" \"I was stunned,\" said Jim Fischer, who was a baby in 1945 when the Cubs last appeared in the Fall Classic.

(Stephen Miller) The father and son piled in the car Tuesday morning for the three-state trek to the shore of Lake Erie, where they visited the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame after checking into their hotel and grabbing lunch as the Cubs prepared for their game against the Indians a few blocks down the street. \"You don't know if you're going to get another chance,\" said Mike Fischer, 34, of Crystal Lake, wearing his Cubs cap outside the entrance to the hall of fame, where he enjoyed the exhibit about one of his favorite bands, Phish. \"You don't know if it'll be another way-too-many years before they make it back (to the Series).\" Amy and David Weber wore Cubs gear as they stopped to take in the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument and the fountains at Public Square a few blocks north of the ballpark. \"She talked me into it,\" David Weber said. \"I called in sick to work. We'll assume that'll be fine.\" Amy Weber, 36, of Deerfield, said she's been a die-hard Cubs fan ever since childhood, when her dad took her to ballgames. With her favorite team in the World Series, she could not pass up a chance to see them, even if her dad, Bruce Dresdner, couldn't make it. Dresdner is in a nursing home in Highland Park.

The atmosphere was more subdued than last week, when there was a Mardi Gras vibe downtown, in outlying city neighborhoods and the Gateway District near Progressive Field. Many Clevelanders turned the day of Game 1 into a citywide holiday, but the lead-up to Game 6 was more reserved, with municipal employees and downtown business workers going about their day and the plaza beyond the left field gate noticeably quieter. Still, it wasn't hard to find someone wearing Indians gear, and many office buildings sported \"Go, Tribe!\" signs in their windows. The Cavaliers, the city's NBA team that plays across the plaza from the baseball stadium, moved up the start time of their game an hour to accommodate the World Series game. Sports talk radio crackled with Indians' fans predictions. All but one caller was convinced their team was wrapping up the title tonight. For the Fischers, the World Series trip was a baseball trip to remember. There was only one thing left on the checklist. \"I don't want any more of this 'Next Year' stuff,\" said Jim Fischer, 72. \"This has got to be the year.\" poconnell@chicagotribune.com ",

Earlier in July, South Sudanese troops attacked civilians near the U.N. mission's headquarters in the city. Jason Patinkin/AP An independent review into attacks against civilians in South Sudan this summer has found the United Nations peacekeeping mission failed to respond adequately, despite their physical proximity to the violence. The investigation was requested by the U.N. secretary-general and carried out by retired Dutch Gen. Patrick Cammaert, after South Sudanese soldiers went on a rampage in the capital, Juba, killing and raping civilians over the course of four days, despite a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the city. One of the targets the soldiers attacked was the Hotel Terrain, where they killed a South Sudanese journalist before assaulting and raping aid workers on July 11. As we reported , aid workers described horrific scenes inside the hotel compound: \"Among [those in the hotel] was Jesse Bunch, a private contractor, who was hiding in a room with several other Westerners and was shot through a door in the leg. \"'They broke down the door, they came in, they began to threaten women, they separated us into groups, they took us outside,' he told NPR. 'We saw where they shot the local journalist and then they began to separate women into the various rooms.' \"'I said, 'Look, these women are here to help you, don't hurt them.' But they continued to take them out and I heard crying in the other rooms.'\" Article continues after sponsorship Since the attack, western aid workers have accused the United Nations of failing to respond. The newly published investigation backs up those claims, and faults the leadership of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan for not acting to protect civilians. ",

Trump highlighted the developments since Friday's announcement from the FBI that it would revisit the Clinton email probe while speaking to a crowd in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. \"For all those voters who have buyer\u2019s remorse, Wisconsin is one of those several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you\u2019ve made a mistake,\" Trump told supporters. \"A lot of stuff has come out since your vote,\" he added. \"If you live here, or Michigan, Pennsylvania, or Minnesota, you change your vote to Donald Trump.\" In Wisconsin, voters can change their minds up to three times, but the deadline for doing so is Thursday. Changing votes is very rarely done, the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College told the Associated Press.

See Predictions Map \u2192 Trump also took time during his rally to hit Clinton presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta and interim chair of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile over emails released by WikiLeaks which appeared to show her sending the Clinton campaign a question before a CNN town hall event while she was a contributor at the network. \"Could you imagine if Reince got the question for a debate and found out,\" Trump told supporters, referencing Republican National Committee Chair Reince Preibus. \"It would be a double electric chair.\" He also used a line from his hit-TV show \"The Apprentice.\" \"John Podesta, if he worked for me I would fire him so fast, like 'The Apprentice,'\" Trump said. \"I would say 'John, you\u2019re fired!'\u201d Clinton meanwhile launched her own fresh line of attacks at a campaign stop in Sanford, Florida by saying the businessman has \"no excuse\" for not releasing his tax returns, and once again calling on him to do so before the election. \"We\u2019ve got someone running for president who not only bullied people and made bigoted comments, he is the only major party nominee for president in 40 years who hasn\u2019t released his tax returns,\" she said. Clinton told supporters she's particularly interested in learning about any dealings Trump has had with Russian interests and whether he contributed to charity. The Democratic presidential nominee told the crowd that most of those in attendance have probably paid more in federal taxes than Trump. \"He took everything our great country has to offer, scooped it up with both hands and then paid nothing to support us,\" Clinton said. \"Then he has the nerve to call our military a disaster, to insult POWs when he hasn\u2019t paid a penny to support the people who put on the uniform of the United States of America.\" She also slammed his business record. \"Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything that is wrong with this economy,\" \u00a0she told supporters. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Got it Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump delivers a speech in King of Prussia, Pa., on Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Jenna Johnson , John Wagner and Sean Sullivan November 1 at 7:31 PM Follow @wpjenna Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @WaPoSean KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa. \u2014 Donald Trump swerved back on script Tuesday, showing flashes of a cohesive closing argument in the final stage of a presidential campaign that is tightening with six days left. Joined here by his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, and a small group of lawmakers, Trump delivered an uncharacteristically disciplined speech calling again for the eradication of the Affordable Care Act and a renegotiation of a sweeping trade pact he cast as a job killer \u2014 championing causes popular among many Republicans in Rust Belt states such as Pennsylvania , Michigan and Wisconsin , where he is urgently trying to expand the map against Hillary Clinton. The Democratic nominee, who is trying to move past the FBI\u2019s renewed scrutiny of her email practices and sustain her advantage in key swing states, sought to redirect attention on Tuesday to Trump\u2019s treatment of women. Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado delivered introductory remarks at a Clinton rally in Dade City, Fla., speaking about Trump\u2019s \u201ccruel\u201d comments about her weight when she held the crown. Clinton cited allegations from a dozen women that Trump had kissed or groped them without permission. Both sides also added fuel to the expensive war they are waging on the airwaves. The Clinton campaign plans to begin airing its first television ads of the general election in Michigan and New Mexico \u2014 where Trump is making a late push this week \u2014 and will return to the airwaves in Virginia and Colorado after a months-long hiatus, a campaign official said. The Trump campaign announced it was investing $25\u00a0million in advertising across 13 states. But it did not say how much would go to each location. Here in Pennsylvania, Trump tried to strike a more uplifting note than usual, a move that seemed geared to centrist voters put off by his dark rhetoric. \u201cIf we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach,\u201d he said. At a rally in Valley Forge, Pa., on Tuesday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump outlined how he would \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act. (The Washington Post) [ The Fix: Trump gave a very good speech today in Pennsylvania ] But it is unclear whether the speech, which had the accoutrements of a much more traditional campaign event than Trump usually holds, will hail a disciplined push in the last week before Election Day or whether he will return to the rudderless approach that has defined much of his campaign. Just as uncertain is whether it will assuage the concerns of moderate voters at a time when extremists continue to embrace Trump publicly, including an endorsement of Trump on Tuesday by the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s official newspaper . In recent rallies and speeches, Trump has lurched from talking about Clinton\u2019s email woes to his unsubstantiated claims of a \u201crigged\u201d election to his priorities for his first days as president. Along the way, he also reignited old spats and revived criticism of Clinton\u2019s health. Inside a hotel ballroom here before an invite-only crowd, however, Trump offered streamlined policy imperatives for supporting him. \u201cIf we don\u2019t repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever,\u201d he said, referring to the Affordable Care Act championed by President Obama. He also displayed more party unity than usual. Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.) and Reps. Tom Price (Ga.) and Andy Harris (Md.), all physicians, helped introduce Trump. So did Rep. Renee L. Ellmers (N.C.), who has worked as a registered nurse. Trump, who has been pledging to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington, referred to them as \u201cdistinguished members of Congress.\u201d Later in the day, Trump attended a roundtable discussion in Wisconsin with that state\u2019s governor, Scott Walker, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. As the audience in Pennsylvania waited to hear Trump speak, they were treated to light jazz rather than the normal jarring soundtrack at Trump events. Pence, the mild-mannered Indiana governor who has rarely appeared together with his running mate, warmed up the crowd and set the stage for the address. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton meets and speaks to voters at a rally in Dade City, Fla., Tuesday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) \u201cWe still got time to turn this thing around. Seven days to be exact,\u201d Pence said. Trump promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and expand \u201cschool choice.\u201d Trump said he swiftly would enlist Congress to help destroy the Affordable Care Act. [ With revived email probe, Republicans see chance to not talk about Trump ] \u201cWhen we win on November 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace,\u201d Trump said. There would be no need for a \u201cspecial session\u201d on Capitol Hill, however: The current Congress will reconvene soon after the Nov.\u00a08 election, while the new Congress will gavel in before Inauguration Day. In Dade City, Machado grew emotional while speaking about Trump\u2019s disparaging remarks about her gaining weight in the 1990s, saying that \u201cit is clear he does not respect women. . . . He thinks he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.\u201d Machado added that for years afterward she fought eating disorders. Clinton spoke at length about the allegations of unwanted sexual advances against Trump and said he has revealed himself to have little respect for women by \u201cdemeaning, degrading, insulting and assaulting\u201d them. Trump has denied the women\u2019s allegations and has suggested that some were not attractive enough to draw his interest. \u201cLook at what he does. He calls women ugly, disgusting, nasty, all the time,\u201d Clinton told the crowd. \u201cHe calls women pigs, rates bodies on a scale from one to 10.\u201d Obama campaigned for Clinton on Tuesday in Ohio \u2014 part of an all-hands-on-deck roster of high-profile surrogates deployed to several battleground states that includes Vice President Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and former president Bill Clinton.\u201cI stand where I\u2019ve stood all fall and all summer. In fact, I already voted here in Janesville for our nominee last week in early voting,\u201d Ryan said on Fox News Channel from his home town. \u201cWe need to support our entire Republican ticket.\u201d \u201cThe only thing this office does is it amplifies who you are. It magnifies who you are,\u201d Obama said in Columbus. \u201cIf you disrespected women before you were elected, you will disrespect women once you\u2019re president.\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who has had an uneasy relationship with Trump throughout the campaign, said in a television interview Tuesday that he had voted for Trump but said he continues to have no plans to campaign for him. [ The KKK\u2019s official newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump ] Trump\u2019s more polished approach in his speech was a departure from what seems at times like randomness in his public remarks lately. During two rallies on Monday in Michigan, Trump mostly focused on promising to return manufacturing jobs. But he mixed in warnings of voter fraud, attacks on Hillary Clinton and random musings on how no one travels to Paris anymore, how Bill O\u2019Reilly is one of the \u201cgreatest political pundits today\u201d and his ability to predict the future. And on Sunday in Greeley, Colo., Trump blamed the NFL\u2019s ratings decline on the campaign and on San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Last week, Trump went off on random tangents during a speech in Charlotte, where he discussed a \u201cnew deal for black America,\u201d mocking long-vanquished rival Jeb Bush, whose moderate Republican supporters he desperately needs. Throughout it all, he has injected dire warnings about illegal immigrants killing Americans, Islamic State militants violently killing innocent people and portrayed the country as having only one final chance to get it right. That track record made what he said \u2014 and how he said it \u2014 in Pennsylvania unexpected. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country,\u201d Trump said.

What Happens When a Drug Overdose Photo Goes Viral by Jon Schuppe On a Saturday afternoon in late October, Jami Smith got a call from the police in her hometown of Hope, Indiana, asking if she knew someone named Erika Hurt. \"That's my daughter,\" Smith replied. The officer told Smith to meet them at a nearby Dollar General Store, where she found Hurt, 25, in the parking lot, unconscious at the wheel of a car, needle in her hand, her 10-month-old son in back. Play Narcan Opioid Antidote Is 'Truly Amazing' 0:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161102080454if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/215660611959\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Smith didn't know it at the time, but one of the officers at the scene had snapped a photo that would turn their private struggle with her heroin addiction into a public symbol of America's opioid crisis. Medics revived Hurt with a shot of Narcan, and took her to the hospital \u2014 while police charged her with child neglect and possession of drug paraphernalia. Smith took her grandson home, and tried make things seem as normal as possible for him. Related: More Children Sick, Dying From Opioid Overdoses: Report Back at police headquarters, Town Marshal Matt Tallent saw the photo, and struggled what to do with it. The nation's heroin epidemic was creeping into tiny Hope, population 2,800, and people needed to know about it, Talent thought. But the police department typically didn't share much beyond mug shots and wanted posters, and there was no policy guiding him. Jami Smith poses for a photo with her daughter Erika Hurt. Courtesy Jami Smith That Monday, Oct. 24, Tallent made his decision. He sent the snapshot to the Indianapolis Star, and afterwards shared it with other local media. He said he didn't know until a reporter told him that police in other small towns around the country \u2014 Ohio , Massachusetts , North Carolina \u2014 had been doing the same thing, as a way to draw attention to the drug problem. \"I hoped it would start spreading the message,\" Tallent recalled. \"But, believe me, I never thought that picture would go as viral as it did.\" Not long after, a friend called Smith and told her to turn on the TV news. On the screen was a photo of her daughter, in black pants and a sweatshirt, head slumped back, mouth slack, syringe pinched between the fingers of her left hand. It was humiliating. Police released an image of Erika Hurt unconscious at the wheel of a car with a needle in her hand on Oct. 22. Hope Police Department \"They said it was a teaching tool. I say they wanted to bring big news to a small town,\" Smith said. \"Unfortunately, my daughter gave them that opportunity.\" Hurt had first gotten hooked on pain pills when she was 21, and eventually graduated to heroin, sinking deep after the death of her father, Smith said. The drugs got her in trouble with the law, and while in jail two years ago she got clean, Smith said. Related: Ohio City Releases Shocking Photos to Show Effects of 'Poison Known as Heroin' As far as Smith knows, Hurt was not using drugs when she got pregnant, and did not do them after her son was born. Smith said she believes that the overdose in the Dollar General Store parking lot was her daughter's first relapse, although Smith acknowledged that she couldn't know for sure. Erika Hurt Courtesy Jami Smith Smith visited her daughter at the Bartholomew County Jail, where Hurt had told her how ashamed and remorseful she was. The picture made it much worse. By then, the photo was spreading across the Internet. Tallen said he saw it in publications as far away as the Czech Republic and Vietnam. Smith began receiving comments on Facebook, \"horrible hate messages.\" The people called her names, and said Erika should have died. Smith deleted her daughter's Facebook page and reset the privacy settings on her own. She noticed unfamiliar cars driving past her house at all hours of the day and night. She wondered how the people of Hope \u2014 \"just a little bitty small, small community town\" \u2014 would respond. \"For the first week, we wouldn't hardly leave the house,\" Smith said. \"We lived in fear.\" Play ",

    "text": "Nov 1 2016, 4:26 pm ET One Week Before Election Day, Early Voting Is Nearly Twice as High as 2012 by Hannah Hartig and John Lapinski Share advertisement More than 26 million voters have already cast early ballots a week ahead of Election Day 2016, nearly double the amount of early vote at this point in the 2012 election, according to new analysis by the NBC News Data Analytics Lab. On October 30, 2012, one week ahead of the Obama vs. Romney match-up, roughly 13.5 million voters had cast early ballots nationwide. Ahead of Election Day, early votes are generally cast via early in-person voting, no excuse in-person absentee voting or mail-in absentee voting. Nov 1 2016, 5:42 pm ET In 12 battleground states in this year's election, 12,602,929 ballots have already been cast. In 2012 in these same states, just 8 million had been cast a week ahead of Election Day. Nov 1 2016, 3:33 pm ET Email Given the widespread attention on early voting in 2016, as well as specific encouragement from both Clinton's and Trump's campaigns to vote early in battleground states, the increase in early voting this year is not fully unexpected, but the magnitude of the increase is notable. While it is not possible to make definitive conclusions about candidate leads or overall turnout at this point, the important question one week ahead of Election Day 2016 is what, if anything, these comparisons can actually tell us about how the 2016 race is shaping up. Nov 1 2016, 3:35 pm ET Email In nearly every battleground state, early voting in 2016 is higher than it was at a similar point in the race in 2012. One exception is Iowa, where roughly 7,000 more voters turned out in 2012 than in 2016 one week ahead of the race. When relating 2012 voter turnout patterns to 2016 patterns, it is important to be cautious in drawing any conclusions about final turnout. While turnout could end up being higher in 2016 compared to 2012, it is not possible to determine whether this will be the case based on early vote numbers. It may simply be the case that voters who normally participate on Election Day are voting earlier. Changes in electoral administration, record-keeping, and reporting of early voting among specific Secretaries of state also may have occurred and can complicate across-year comparisons. State legislation regarding voter identification laws, shortening and lengthening of early voting windows and other procedural factors can also impact early voting in myriad ways. In Arizona and Colorado, for example, changes in mandatory vote-by-mail laws in select counties can seemingly inflate early vote numbers. With all of these caveats in mind, there are still some important takeaways so far. When looking at the partisan breakdown of early voters in 2012 compared to 2016, Democratic-affiliated voters are outpacing their early 2012 performance in several battleground states. Nov 1 2016, 4:31 pm ET Email In Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania, Republican-affiliated voters outpaced Democrat-affiliated voters in 2012 and also do so in 2016, though by smaller margins. Similarly, in Iowa, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin, Democratic-affiliated voters also voted at higher rates than Republican-affiliated voters in 2012 a week ahead of the Election and are continuing this trend in 2016. In Colorado, Michigan and Virginia, things look quite different from this year's vantage point than they did in 2012. In 2012, Republican -affiliated voters outpaced Democrats in Colorado and Virginia by 3-point margins and a 13-point margin in Michigan. This year, Democratic-affiliated voters are outpacing Republicans by 3 points in Colorado and Michigan, and by 13 points in Virginia. In Florida, a state that has received widespread attention this election cycle as it has in previous years, the number of Republican -affiliated voters and Democratic-affiliated voters who have cast ballots are tied as they were in 2012. Obama won Florida over Romney in 2012 by less than a percentage point. As the campaign enters the final days of campaigning, these comparisons are informative because each candidate is pushing hard for a partisan advantage in early vote totals with the hope of going into Election Day with a lead. As more candidates put emphasis on the early electoral calendar, we may see many more voters in the United States casting ballots well before Election Day moving forward. The 2012 and 2016 comparative early vote analysis was conducted by the NBC News Data Analytics Lab using voter file data provided by TargetSmart . Hannah Hartig ",

Time Alabama defensive back Marlon Humphrey, left, celebrates fellow DB Ronnie Harrison (15) after an interception against Texas A&M; on Oct. 22. (Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP) The initial College Football Playoff rankings of the season had one surprise. Alabama, Clemson and Michigan were expected to be in the top three. What was unexpected was one-loss Texas A&M being ahead of unbeaten Washington in the fourth position. The Aggies, whose lone blemish is a loss at\u00a0Alabama, sit\u00a0at No. 7 in the Amway Coaches Poll. But their difficult schedule in the Southeastern Conference, including a win at Auburn, helped move them past the Huskies. Washington has dominating wins against Stanford and Oregon\u00a0and a narrow victory Saturday\u00a0at Utah, but, despite being 8-0, are currently out of the playoff field. TOP 25:\u00a0 First CFP rankings \u201cTexas A&M won at Auburn and beat Arkansas at a neutral site,\u201d said selection committee chairman Kirby Hocutt, the athletics director at Texas Tech. \u201cIn the committee\u2019s mind, Texas A&M has played a stronger schedule.\u201d As for Clemson at No. 2 and Michigan at No. 3, a flip-flop\u00a0from the Amway Coaches Poll and AP poll, Hocutt said the margin was very narrow. \u201cThe two wins against CFP top 10 (teams) were something that stood out to us that nobody else within the CFP top 25 have,\u201d Hocutt said. \u201cThe road wins at (No. 9) Auburn and (No. 22) Florida State and obviously the win at home against (No. 7) Louisville gave the edge to Clemson for that No. 2 spot. ... \u201cThe separation was small,\u201d Hocutt said. \u201cMichigan has beaten three teams in our top 25, including a very good CFP ranked No. 8 Wisconsin team. Michigan has a great defense and has been very consistent as the season has gone along. Again, the separation between two and three was very small.\u201d One-loss teams Ohio State and Louisville were in the sixth and seventh positions with five weeks still left in the season. Wisconsin, Auburn and Nebraska round out the top 10, giving the Big Ten four teams and the SEC three near the top. Ranking Reaction: Texas A&M No. 4 for now, but no worries, Washington Also of note, No. 23 Western Michigan was one spot ahead of Boise State in the race among teams in the Group of Five conferences for a spot in one of the major bowls. Tuesday's ranking is the first of six to be unveiled by the playoff committee. The\u00a0top four teams in the final ranking on Dec. 4 will meet in the College Football Playoff. The semifinals will be played at the Fiesta Bowl and Peach Bowl on Dec. 31.\u00a0The championship game will be held in Tampa, Fla, on Jan. 9. Here is the complete Top 25 from the committee: 1. Alabama (8-0) ",

Alison Meuse/NPR hide caption toggle caption Young people pose at \"I Heart Damascus\" in Omayyad Square, in the capital of Syria. Alison Meuse/NPR At Damascus University, Syria's oldest and largest institution of higher education, students casually stroll the sprawling campus. Female students sport salon-fresh locks or smart white headscarves. Skinny jeans are still in fashion. The sounds are of fountains and chirping birds, not of bombs. A na\u00efve tourist could be forgiven for forgetting there is a brutal war tearing apart Aleppo, a city 200 miles to the north, or that armed opposition groups continue to have a foothold in the capital itself. But there are no tourists here. My NPR colleague Peter Kenyon and I were at the university for a government-approved conference this week, which offered a rare opportunity for foreign journalists to visit Damascus. As a journalist based in Beirut, covering Syria for the past 4 1/2 years, I spend hours each day communicating via Skype, Whatsapp and Facebook with Syrians suffering the unimaginable: hunger, bombings and siege. Some are living in areas surrounded and under fire by hard-line opposition groups, others by ISIS, and still more, are under attack by their own government. Article continues after sponsorship For Foreign Journalists, A Rare Invitation To Damascus As I leave the campus and walk through the streets of Damascus, bustling with cars, couples and children, I wonder how many of the capital's residents have grown used to the strange paradox of life during wartime. Did they lose a brother serving in the army or perhaps in a rebel brigade? How many had relatives kidnapped by the gangs that have sprung up amid the chaos? Maybe they had a son or daughter thrown in prison for joining the protests in those early days of the uprising in 2011. I wonder if they changed their minds about the upheaval when they saw hard-line jihadists rise to prominence and vow to take their cosmopolitan city. Do they believe it was the government's crackdown that pushed the protesters to arms and drove throngs of young dreamers from the country? Many here seem to be carrying on with grace and dignity, even enjoying mundane, simple pleasures \u2014 like the teenage girls and a 40-something man snapping selfies in front of a giant \"I (Heart) Damascus\" sculpture in a main square. Enlarge this image Syrian students on campus at a Damascus University in 2012, a year after the war started. Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty Images Syrian students on campus at a Damascus University in 2012, a year after the war started. Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty Images At the phone carrier, Syriatel, the salesman helping me set up a local cell number asked if I could be patient while he helped two trainees, a man and a woman, learn the ropes. It was a good opportunity to register a mobile to someone with a foreign passport, in this case, a U.S. passport. He walked us through each step, gently reminding them to get the passport number right and asking with care if I wanted an \"nice number\" \u2014 one easy to memorize. When the time came to pay, I realized I was just short of the Syrian pounds needed. There would be no credit card fallback or paying in dollars like I can in neighboring Lebanon. In Syria, cash is king; sanctions have stifled whatever global financial engagement the country was adopting before the war. Maybe the Syriatel salesman blamed the U.S. government for imposing sanctions, but if so, he didn't let on. Almost bashful, he told me not to worry and that I could come back anytime before closing to bring the money. So began my odyssey to find a place to change my American dollars. After going along the street from bank to bank, holding out hope for the Lebanese branches, I realized I'd have to go across town to the Central Bank district, where I'd find exchange offices. I flagged down a cab, agreeing to pay him at the end of our errands. We wound through Damascus traffic, finally arriving at our destination, a private exchange office on a tree-lined street, in sight of the imposing Central Bank. Changing $500 to be safe, I received in return wads of Syrian 500-pound notes bound in rubber bands. The teller handed me a black plastic bag to keep my transaction out of sight and a receipt, signed and stamped, with the official exchange rate of 514 Syrian pounds to the dollar. The government maintains this rate despite the existence of the black market, which pays slightly better. Back to my cab and I was on my way again through traffic, back at Syriatel to deliver the 4,000 Syrian pounds I owed. The salesman and his trainees smiled graciously and I went out the door, feeling more conscious of how cut off we were from the rest of the world. It was time to get back to the British Syrian Society conference my colleague and I were attending. I had missed the panel on the impact of sanctions. ",

    "text": "By Robert Costa November 1 at 9:17 PM Follow @costareports WAUKESHA, Wis. \u2014 Donald Trump got the big October surprise. The momentum seems to be going his way. Hillary Clinton is again on the defensive, again over her emails . But in this enclave of white, upper-middle-class Republicans, the party\u2019s presidential nominee still faces a barrier that will be difficult to clear. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral choice,\u201d Dick Radder, a 68-year-old Republican, said as he cupped a black coffee outside a Starbucks here Tuesday. \u201cI can\u2019t get there. I can\u2019t get to Trump. I\u2019m a husband and a father. And I can\u2019t convince myself to vote for a person who is weakening the fiber of the country.\u201d Most of the well-kept lawns here are dotted with signs for Sen. Ron Johnson (R) and for other down-ballot candidates, but support for Trump is less evident. \u201cYou\u2019re in a town that\u2019s about going to college and raising a family. People are polished and hard-working. He\u2019s not one of us,\u201d said Andy Schwichtenberg, a 28-year-old stockbroker. \u201cI did try,\u201d Schwichtenberg added with a sigh. \u201cI went to a rally.\u201d But he was not swayed and he was turned off by the crowd, which he noted was packed with men and women \u201cwho came there on Harleys.\u201d Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. View Graphic Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a two-term Democratic president for the first time since the mid-19th century. In the last days of a presidential race where Trump is targeting traditionally Democratic states to try to forge a path to victory, holding together Republicans who have reservations about him remains a vexing challenge for a candidate who has repeatedly clashed with his own party. Nowhere has that been more true than Wisconsin, a state that celebrates civility and is the historic home of the Republican Party, which was founded in Ripon in 1854. Trump lost Wisconsin\u2019s April GOP primary by 13 percentage points to Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), and he lost in Waukesha County by 39 percentage points. More recent polling has shown lingering unease about his character in this small city and other Milwaukee suburbs, long a hub of deeply conservative Republicans \u2014 and where strong turnout will be necessary for Trump to win. \u201cThey have just never been comfortable with Trump,\u201d Charlie Sykes, a popular talk radio host, said in an interview Monday night. \u201cThe only question, the only thing people are talking about, is whether they\u2019ll come home.\u201d Sykes, who has been a leader of anti-Trump efforts within the Wisconsin right, said Trump\u2019s chances will come down to what are called the \u201cwow\u201d counties \u2014 Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington \u2014 that need intense GOP participation to offset the heavy Democratic numbers coming out of Milwaukee, Madison and other liberal parts of the state. Trump, who rallied Tuesday in northwest Wisconsin, is intent on making a late play, pitching himself to independents and working-class voters as someone who channels their economic frustrations. Trump\u2019s push is reminiscent of how previous Republican nominees have tried with little success in past frenzied final weeks to score blue state upsets when other battlegrounds started to look less likely to go their way. Mitt Romney, for example, drew huge November crowds in Pennsylvania in 2012 but lost the state by five percentage points. Trump greets Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker before meeting with a group of invited small-business owners in Altoona, Wis., on Tuesday. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Still, Trump\u2019s advisers hope that the FBI\u2019s announcement last week that the agency is resuming its investigation of Clinton\u2019s emails could be enough of an impetus for Wisconsin Republicans to finally decide to vote a straight party ticket, even if they will never warm up to him. The campaign\u2019s view, voiced in several interviews, is that if Trump can spark Republicans in the suburbs and rural regions, the party organization here is ready to gin up turnout. \u201cYou do have a bit of a feathered nest,\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said, noting that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who is from Wisconsin, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker have built a robust state party over the past decade that has made significant gains in non-presidential years. \u201cI tell people to remember that we\u2019re not hiring a pope,\u201d Laurie Bujack, 57, said as she made calls at a bustling county GOP field office decorated with a crucifix, posters of Ronald Reagan and a life-size cutout of the local GOP hero, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.). Nearby, Chuck Bloom, a retired 73-year-old salesman in a Trump T-shirt, said he identifies with those who were not with Trump at the start \u2014 he certainly was not. But now, he said, is \u201cno time to be on the fence\u201d or have \u201cyour nose out of joint.\u201d \u201cIt could be Hillary, God forbid,\u201d he said. Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, campaigned Tuesday alongside Walker, a familiar face in the Milwaukee suburbs and who clashed with Trump in the primaries. Republicans are hoping his more recent support will help rally wavering voters. \u201cThe message his being there with Trump sends is: Trump is the Republican candidate. Get behind all of our Republicans,\u201d said Candee Arndt, a veteran activist and longtime friend of Walker. \u201cThis is about the Supreme Court and the federal courts. It\u2019s about more than Trump.\u201d Wisconsin Democrats, meanwhile, are busy rousing their coalition, dubious but slightly unnerved about Trump\u2019s foray into a state that they have won, at times narrowly, since 1988. \u201cI know what it was like during the times Trump says were \u2018good.\u2019 We\u2019re not going back, and I\u2019m trying to tell the young people what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Alma Johnson, 74, said Monday at a phone bank in Milwaukee with dozens of African American Democrats. In another sign that Clinton is not taking Wisconsin for granted, her campaign last week reserved television advertising time in the state. Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, appeared at Wisconsin college campuses Tuesday, and her daughter, Chelsea, will make three stops Wednesday. Clinton, who lost the Wisconsin primary handily to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, is getting help from her onetime rival, who will be in Madison and Green Bay on Wednesday to campaign for Clinton and former Democratic senator Russell Feingold, who is locked in a hotly contested race with Ron Johnson. The polling average in Wisconsin shows Clinton up by nearly six percentage points. President Obama won Wisconsin by about seven percentage points over Romney and by 12 percentage points in 2008. President George W. Bush came far closer in 2000 and 2004, losing both times by a few thousand votes. By Tuesday afternoon, more than 518,000 early votes had already been cast, according to the state\u2019s elections commission. For Democrats, the data was seen as favorable since about 30\u00a0percent came from the urban part of Milwaukee and the Madison area \u2014 more than the 26\u00a0percent of statewide ballots those counties provided in 2012. Making calls Monday night with Democrats, Hazel Frazier, 65, argued that working-class whites are not sure bets for Trump for reasons different from why many wealthier conservatives are averse to him. \u201cI used to work at General Motors, which has left. When those jobs go, it leaves black people and it leaves white people without what they had,\u201d Frazier said beneath a poster that read in part, \u201cDon\u2019t get frustrated!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m an old bird, and I don\u2019t buy that working-class folks are going to go for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see through men like him, and we\u2019re sick of the damn emails.\u201d Early voting is up by similar margins in the \u201cwow\u201d counties \u2014 providing 16\u00a0percent of the absentee ballots. Four years earlier, those counties counted for 12\u00a0percent of the vote. \u201cYou couple the FBI announcement with the organization we\u2019ve built, we feel very good,\u201d said Mike Duffey, the executive director of the Wisconsin GOP. He said there are more than 30 offices in the state prepared to meet new and nontraditional voters who may come out on Election Day to register and vote for Trump. As Robin Moore, 53, president of the Republican Women of Waukesha County, said Monday: \u201cRepublicans here have moved from lesser of two evils to one evil. That\u2019s progress.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been hard for some women, and those tensions [with Ryan] didn\u2019t help,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we have to save the Supreme Court and we have to stop her.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Tax Loopholes Trump May Have Used to Avoid Payments By Paul Blake Nov 1, 2016, 6:37 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump In A Minute 0 Shares Email Donald Trump may have used a questionable and now-prohibited tax maneuver to avoid tens of millions of dollars in personal income taxes, the New York Times reported . In its story, published Monday night, The Times said documents it had obtained while researching bankruptcy filings on his New Jersey casinos shed new light into Trump\u2019s tax dealings in the early 1990s. \"As he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited,\" The Times wrote. The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images Exterior of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino and hotel resort. In those years, Trump may have swapped outstanding debts for partial ownership in the corporate arrangements behind his New Jersey casino empire. According to The Times, through this method Trump may have been able to avoid paying taxes on debts that were forgiven by lenders when his casinos went bust. Because Trump has broken with the decades-long tradition of releasing tax returns as part of his bid to run for president , the tax acrobatics he may or may not have performed are unclear. This is the second report in the past month about questionable finance practices that may be in the Republican nominee\u2019s unreleased tax returns based on portions of his documents that have been discovered. About a month earlier, the Times reported that Trump had claimed a $916 million business loss in 1995, which -- through a legal provision of the law -- could have allowed him to write-down taxes for up to 18 years. Read More: How Donald Trump Could Have Legally Avoided Paying Taxes for 18 Years As he has continued down the campaign trail, Trump has deflected his opponents\u2019 criticisms. He claims he can't release his returns because he is under audit. However, the IRS has said that there is no law preventing those under audit from releasing their tax returns to the public. When asked during the second presidential debate whether he had used a business loss to avoid paying taxes as had previously been alleged, he said, \"Of course I do.\" The 'Tax Maneuver' Explained In short, the report claims that Trump had used a complex arrangement whereby each of his three Atlantic City casinos was owned by a partnership. A partnership was formed between himself and a company he wholly-owned, the Times explained in a complementary story . \"The corporations were basically alter egos,\" Steven Rosenthal, who is a Senior Fellow at the Tax Policy Center and one of those who reviewed the documents for the New York Times, told ABC News. \"When the partnership restructures its debt to public bondholders or other creditors like banks, the partnership is really acting as an alter ego for Trump.\" The arrangement the Times claims existed would have come in handy when Trump\u2019s casinos hit hard times. If lenders -- knowing that Trump\u2019s partnerships were unable to repay their debts -- had cancelled their share of the debt, the amount of that forgiveness would have counted as income to Trump's partnerships for tax purposes, Kyle Pomerleau of the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a think tank, told ABC News. Realizing that canceled debt as income could have resulted in a massive tax bill for the embattled casino-owning partnerships, The Times said Trump instead may have offered lenders a deal: equity, or partial ownership, in his partnerships in exchange for canceling his debts to them. Such an equity-for-debt swap would mean that lenders would have been given partial ownership of the casino-controlling partnerships in place of the debt payments. If this scenario did occur, as The New York Times suggests, then the casino-owning partnerships would not have to report canceled debt as income on their taxes, according to Pomerleau. \"The partnership, in effect, is allowed forgiveness on its debt,\" Rosenthal explained, \"but no income to Trump because the partnership purports to use its own equity to retire its debt.\" Meanwhile, Pomerleau said, the lenders may have been able to claim the forgiveness as a business loss -- potentially saving on their own tax bills. Bettmann Archive Donald Trump discusses his new casino, the Taj Mahal, from in front of a sea of slot machines. The expert had an additional concern: if the equity in the partnerships that the lenders had been given declined in value, those lenders could claim a capital loss on their taxes, as well -- potentially providing even more tax benefits. In other words, lenders \"would be able to take another deduction on a transaction that really didn\u2019t create any economic activity,\" Pomerleau told ABC News. However, because Trump's tax returns have not been released to the public, whether or not Trump used these tactics is uncertain. \"It\u2019s quite possible that the IRS slapped this down, when he attempted,\" Pomerleau said. \"We just don\u2019t know.\" According to The Times, Congress barred the use of equity-for-debt swaps by partnerships in 2004. The paper said that Hillary Clinton , who was a Senator at the time, voted in favor of the measure. Responding to the story, Trump Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the New York Times: \"Your thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe. Mr. Trump does not think that taxpayers should file returns that resolve all doubt in favor of the I.R.S. And any tax experts that you have consulted are engaged in pure speculation. There is no news here.\" On ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Tuesday, Trump Deputy Campaign Manager David Bossie called The Times' report \"incredibly unfair\" and reiterated that Trump's taxes were not available because he is under audit. Anchor George Stephanopoulous pointed out, however, that the allegations stem from the 1990s and any audit cases would be closed by now. 0 Shares ",

By Karen Tumulty and Paul Kane November 1 at 1:56 PM Follow @ktumulty Follow @pkcapitol The latest Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll shows Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a virtual dead heat nationally. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The Hillary Clinton email controversy has given down-ballot Republicans something they badly need in the final days of the election: an opportunity to go on offense and talk about something other than Donald Trump. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s latest chapter in her ongoing email scandal, saga, is just a reminder of how much corruption there is in Washington and how disturbing this is,\u201d the embattled Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R- Pa .) told voters this week at a diner in the town of Media, near Philadelphia. He noted that the administration of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) is resisting a court order to release more than 50,000 emails that Toomey\u2019s Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, sent while she was the governor\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cHer devotion to Hillary Clinton is so complete that now she\u2019s decided that she has to have her own email scandal,\u201d Toomey said. McGinty, left, and Toomey, right, at an Oct. 24 debate in Philadelphia. (Photos by Matt Rourke/AP) As recently as a week ago, the Republicans\u2019 chances of holding on to the Senate appeared to be slipping away. Individual GOP candidates\u2019 efforts to distance themselves from Trump were being overwhelmed by the furor over an 11-year-old video in which the nominee boasted of kissing and groping women without their consent, and the subsequent claims by a procession of women that he had actually committed such acts. Last Tuesday, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which had earlier predicted that Republicans would manage to keep their Senate losses low, shifted to a projection that the Democrats would pick up five to seven seats \u2014 enough to regain control of the chamber. In the last 15 public polls, all in October, Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate race has been nearly deadlocked: Three showed a tie, four had Toomey ahead and seven gave McGinty an edge, with most of those leads being within the margin of error. But now, Republicans see a chance to change the subject and remind voters of the drama and perceived moral ambiguity that has surrounded the Clintons for more than a quarter-century. Republicans could hardly have conjured a better \u201cOctober surprise\u201d than the revelation that a trove of emails belonging to close Clinton aide Huma Abedin had turned up on the laptop of Abedin\u2019s husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who is under investigation over sexually suggestive texts he allegedly sent to a 15-year-old girl. However the latest FBI investigation of Abedin\u2019s emails turns out, the fact that they are even at issue goes back to Clinton\u2019s initial misjudgment in setting up a private email account and server. And that can be traced to the secretive impulses that have so often driven the candidate and her inner circle. \u201cThis is what life with the Clintons look like,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told Fox News on Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s always a scandal, one after another. There\u2019s an investigation.\u201d \u201cSo they can\u2019t win,\u201d he added, \u201cand she can come in with a Democratic Congress \u2014 worst of all possible things \u2014 if Republicans do not turn out and do not vote.\u201d Though it is an implicit acknowledgment of the fact that the Democrat remains more likely than not to win the White House , Republicans are seizing upon an argument that they must retain control of Congress to be a check on Clinton \u2014 not only on her agenda but on the behavior of her administration. \u201cWe used to say in prosecution, it\u2019s primacy and recency. The closing argument reintroduces all of the most pertinent issues,\u201d said Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.), who was campaigning with Toomey. \u201cLook at this,\u201d Meehan said in reference to the latest email controversy. \u201cThis is almost the personification of the trust issue.\u201d The email issue may also have the effect of helping to unify Republicans, who have been divided over Trump. Don Chesnet, 71, a retired small-business man, explained his views of Trump and Clinton, respectively: \u201cYou either have scum or you have a criminal.\u201d He added that \u201cscum\u201d might not rub off, while criminal behavior was an affront to taxpayers. View Graphic Even a small shift in the political breeze could have a big impact on the Senate races, said Charlie Cook, editor and publisher of the Cook Political Report. \u201cThere are six races that are just teetering on the edge, where it wouldn\u2019t take much to tip several of them the same way,\u201d Cook said. He added that there is a significant slice of the electorate that is voting for Clinton primarily because they find Trump unacceptable. \u201cThey don\u2019t like her, don\u2019t trust her and would rather not vote for her but feel they have no choice,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThere are a lot of voters who would certainly like to hedge [that vote] a little bit.\u201d Some Democrats worry that they have seen all this before \u2014 the last time that someone named Clinton was their standard-bearer. In 1996, Bill Clinton was cruising to reelection when a controversy exploded over the fact that Democrats had been taking large donations from foreign entities that are forbidden from donating to U.S. campaigns. A number of those illegal donors had access to the Clinton White House. \u201cThat\u2019s a good parallel\u201d to the effect that the resurgent email controversy could have today, a senior House Democrat said, requesting anonymity to discuss the downbeat feeling some have. In 1996, Bill Clinton\u2019s big lead held up, although he remained under 50\u00a0percent and House Democrats \u2014 who had hoped to bounce back into the majority after their disastrous 1994 showing \u2014 picked up fewer than five seats and remained in the minority for a decade to come. The 42nd president also had a contentious relationship with the FBI director at the time, Louis Freeh \u2014 and such a drama could play out again with another Clinton in the Oval Office. Hillary Clinton and her top campaign officials have been highly critical of the unusual decision by FBI Director James B. Comey to go public Friday with the fact that the bureau had resumed its investigation of the emails. All of which gives voters a new set of crosscurrents to navigate as Election Day draws near. For down-ballot Democrats, Sharon Jankauskas is their nightmare. The 60-year-old nurse practitioner, who attended Toomey\u2019s campaign event in Media, said she sees the presidential races as the \u201clesser of two evils.\u201d She plans to vote for Clinton but is also pulling for Toomey. She also likes Clinton\u2019s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). So Jankauskas is looking for what, in her view, is a silver lining to electing Clinton: \u201cWe can always impeach her and get her out.\u201d All of which raises the possibility that another Clinton in the White House could bring a reprise of the political culture of the 1990s, when a Republican Congress was constantly investigating the Clintons. Americans have already gotten a foretaste. when the congressional panel investigating the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, helped uncover the fact that Clinton had been using a private email address and server when she was secretary of state. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told CNN that if Clinton is elected, Congress will continue its scrutiny. \u201cThe legislative branch does have an obligation to provide oversight,\u201d Gowdy said.

Officials in Tulsa say an officer left her keys in the unlocked car during a coffee break, around 8 p.m. Monday, and 25-year-old John Pinney allegedly got inside. Tulsa police sergeant Steve Stoltz said a woman called 911 not long after and told the dispatcher she saw a man get into a police car and he asked if she wanted a ride, but drove off when she said no. Multiple agencies responded, resulting in a chase that lasted between 30 and 40 minutes, at speeds of more than 120 miles per hour, according to police. While the chase was ongoing, Pinney posted videos to Facebook, allegedly using the officer\u2019s iPad. \u201cI\u2019m in the cop car. Where\u2019s my sirens at?\u201d Pinney can be heard saying, before clicking a button. \u201cYou hear my sirens? Look, check it out.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t even believe that I\u2019m doing this though, for real,\u201d Pinney said. \u201cI got away from like five cops already.\u201d Later, he turned on the radio and sang along to a country song, and also appeared to explain why he got in the patrol car. \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing else to do, but (expletive) read books,\u201d Pinney said. The video below includes explicit language: Posted by John Pinney on Monday, October 31, 2016 Police eventually arrested Pinney on the block where he lives. He was booked into the Tulsa County Jail on nine complaints, including eluding, resisting arrest and possession of a firearm by a felon. Stoltz said the videos will likely be used against Pinney in court. \u201cI would encourage every criminal out there to Facebook Live their crimes so that we can catch you a lot easier and use that Facebook Live at your trial to get a better conviction,\u201d Stoltz said. The Tulsa Police Department has not said whether the officer whose car was stolen will face any disciplinary action for leaving the keys in the car.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Record 1:01 p.m. EDT November 2, 2016 Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni (Photo: FILE PHOTOS) NEWARK\u00a0\u2014 The first full day of jury deliberation in the Bridgegate trial signaled trouble for Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, the former associates of Gov. Chris Christie fighting charges that they blocked access to the George Washington Bridge to punish a local mayor. Judge Susan D. Wigenton ruled Tuesday \u2014 in response to a question from the jury \u2014 that each defendant could be found guilty of conspiracy without a determination that they intentionally punished the mayor, Fort Lee\u2019s Mark Sokolich, for not endorsing Christie\u2019s re-election. Although that is the reason prosecutors allege Kelly and Baroni conspired to close access lanes to the bridge, Wigenton said their motive \u201cis not an element that has to be proved.\u201d The defense team clearly was frustrated with the decision. \u201cYou\u2019re directing a verdict of guilty,\u201d said Michael Critchley, the lead lawyer for Kelly. Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Christie, and Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority, have been charged with conspiracy, wire fraud and civil rights violations for their alleged roles in the September 2013 lane closures. They have defended themselves as unwitting accomplices in a retribution scheme devised by David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official who has pleaded guilty in the case and is cooperating with the prosecution. Over the trial\u2019s six weeks, the defense teams have built a case that their clients were duped into thinking the lanes in Fort Lee were realigned for a traffic study and then they were tangled in a coverup reaching the highest levels of the governor\u2019s office. Critchley and Baroni\u2019s lead attorney, Michael Baldassare, each urged the jury before it broke to deliberate to consider what is known as the \u201cgood faith\u201d defense, which says that acting in good faith is a \u201ccomplete defense\u201d of charges because that is inconsistent with acting knowingly and intentionally. Around midday, the jury sent a question to the judge: \u201cCan you be guilty of conspiracy without the act being intentionally punitive toward Mayor Sokolich?\u201d Critchley and Baldassare argued for the judge to instruct the jury to return to the good faith defense. \u201cAny other answer than no would eviscerate that defense,\u201d Critchley said. When the judge said she would tell the jury otherwise, Critchley fell back in his chair dramatically. The judge snapped at Critchley. \u201cIt\u2019s an involuntary reaction, judge,\u201d he said. When Critchley told Wigenton that her decision was tantamount to a guilty verdict, she replied, \u201cthank you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, judge,\u201d Critchley said. Wigenton\u2019s decision Tuesday reaffirms one she made last week, when she sided with the prosecution in removing language about punishing Sokolich from the conspiracy charges read to the jury before it broke for deliberation. Critchley\u2019s frustration appeared to have been building when Wigenton made her decision. On an earlier question from the jury about a pre-trial procedure, Critchley and Assistant U.S. Attorney David Feder had a testy exchange in the courtroom. Critchley\u2019s voice rose to a shout as he argued his side to the judge. \u201cTake it down a notch,\u201d Feder said, adding that he was concerned the jury in the next room might hear. \u201cThe court tells me what to do,\u201d Critchley said. \u201cNot you.\u201d The jury is expected to resume deliberations on Wednesday.

Matt Slocum/AP The Chicago Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians 9-3 in Game 6 of the World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland. The best-of-seven Series is now even at three games each. The decisive Game 7 will be played Wednesday in Cleveland. The Cubs were led by starter Jake Arrieta who gave up two runs and three hits in five-plus innings. He struck out nine and walked three Indians batters. He also had the luxury of watching teammate Addison Russell collect 6 RBIs, with a two-run double in the first inning and a grand slam in the third. Chicago struck early, scoring three runs in the top of the first inning with a two-out solo home run by Kris Bryant, followed by Russell's double on a fly ball that was mis-played by the Indians outfielders. The Cubs blew the game open in the third inning when they loaded the bases on a walk and two singles, chasing Indians starter Josh Tomlin. Cleveland reliever Dan Otero promptly gave up a grand slam to Russell. The Indians showed sporadic signs of life. They threatened to get back in the game in the fourth inning with a double by Jason Kipnis and an RBI single by Mike Napoli. They loaded the bases, but Cubs starter Jake Arrieta worked out of the jam.

Phillip/AP The Indians got another run on a solo home run by Kipnis in the fifth inning. Article continues after sponsorship Arrieta was pulled from the game after getting two outs in the sixth inning. Cubs reliever Mike Montgomery got the third out. The Cubs appeared to slam the door shut in the ninth inning when Anthony Rizzo smacked a two-run homer to right field, making the score 9-2. But the Indians scored one more in the ninth when Roberto Perez hit an RBI single before getting thrown out at second base trying to stretch out a double. Despite his team's lead throughout the game, Chicago manager Joe Maddon made it clear he was taking no chances in allowing Chicago to stage a comeback. He brought in his flame-throwing reliever Aroldis Chapman in the seventh inning when the Indians were threatening again. Chapman induced a ground out by Indians Francisco Lindor. Chapman pitched into the ninth inning, giving up one run and one hit. He threw 20 pitches and the question many will ask is, how much does he have left for Game 7? The final game will feature a showdown between Indians ace Corey Kluber, the winning pitcher of Games 1 and 4, and Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks. ",

Blandford USA TODAY NETWORK TCPalm 8:46 p.m. EDT November 1, 2016 Images from Austin Harrouff arriving at the Martin County Sheriff's Office to be processed into the Martin County Jail on Monday, Oct. 3, 2016, in Stuart. (Photo: LEAH VOSS/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS ) MARTIN COUNTY \u2014 Austin Harrouff was aware he bit a person from what he told Florida deputies the night he\u2019s accused of killing a local couple, according to court documents. The 19-year-old Florida State University student and Jupiter, Fla., resident hasn\u2019t talked to sheriff\u2019s officials since Aug. 15, when he\u2019s accused of killing John Stevens III, 59, and Michelle Mishcon, 53, in the garage of their Kokomo Lane home. However, according to the paperwork requesting a search warrant of the couple\u2019s home, Harrouff did speak to deputies at the scene that night. While he was being taken into custody, deputies heard Harrouff say, \u201cHelp me, I ate something bad.\u201d When asked what he ate, Harrouff said, \u201cHumans.\u201d According to court documents: A deputy arrived and found Harrouff on top of Stevens, who was lying on his back in the driveway. Harrouff tried to bite Stevens on the chest. The deputy saw Harrouff actually biting Stevens several times and spitting out his flesh. The deputy noticed Stevens and Mischon had cuts consistent with injuries from a bladed or edged weapon. Another deputy arrived and saw Harrouff chewing on the side of Stevens\u2019s face. Harrouff didn\u2019t respond to commands to stop, so deputies had to use force to subdue him. Harrouff then was taken to St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center in West Palm Beach. While at the hospital, a sheriff\u2019s detective saw Harrouff spit out what appeared to be human flesh, which was recovered by crime scene investigators. The detective also saw Harrouff had human hair in his mouth. Harrouff\u2019s attorney, Bob Watson, wrote a note for his client that stated Harrouff was exercising his right to remain silent and was represented by legal counsel, said sheriff\u2019s detective Lt. Michael Dougherty. Harrouff carried the note with him in his pocket and showed it when asked any questions, Dougherty said. Harrouff remained hospitalized until his Oct. 3 arrest. He faces four charges: two counts of second-degree murder with a weapon, attempted felony murder with a weapon and burglary of a dwelling with an assault or battery while armed. Two other charges, burglary of a dwelling while armed and resisting an officer without violence, were dropped Tuesday. Assistant State Attorney Nita Denton said the burglary charge was dropped because the state filed the higher burglary charge. The state is expected to seek two counts of first-degree murder against Harrouff, if he is indicted by a grand jury. A grand jury is expected to hear the case by the end of the year. Sheriff's officials continue to wait for toxicology results from the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, to find out whether Harrouff had flakka or bath salts in his system at the time of the attack. Hospital testing already ruled out marijuana, cocaine and opioids. 2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eSzNm3 ",

Huma Abedin, longtime aide to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. (Patrick Semansky / Associated Press) Del Quentin Wilber Even if FBI agents discover classified information on a newly seized laptop, Hillary Clinton is unlikely to\u00a0face criminal charges, according to legal experts and former federal prosecutors. That\u2019s largely because the Justice Department and FBI Director James B. Comey have already declined to prosecute\u00a0based on a legal conclusion\u00a0that there was\u00a0no evidence that\u00a0Clinton and her aides intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, a key element of\u00a0such a criminal\u00a0offense. To change the calculus, the FBI would have to find correspondence that\u00a0clearly demonstrates\u00a0Clinton or her aides knowingly broke the law, exchanged materials they knew to be classified\u00a0or attempted to interfere with the investigation by withholding or destroying evidence, according to former federal prosecutors and legal scholars. \u201cSuch an email itself would have to be one of those things you would be saying, \u2018I\u00a0can\u2019t believe you wrote that down,\u2019\u201d said Roscoe Howard\u00a0Jr. ,\u00a0a former federal prosecutor and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cI would be shocked if they found such a thing.\u201d Campaign 2016 updates: FBI gets warrant to search newfound emails Oct. 30, 2016, 5:05 p.m. Donald Trump campaigns in Las Vegas and Hillary Clinton stumps in Florida. The FBI will examine newly discovered emails possibly linked to Hillary Clinton's private serverTrump's campaign says the new email... (Joseph Tanfani) The chances of the bureau missing such evidence after what Comey had\u00a0described as a comprehensive inquiry would appear to be slight, former prosecutors\u00a0said. \u201cShort of a truly inculpatory email, the existence of which I find hard to fathom, I don\u2019t see a situation that comes out of this that justifies the hoopla,\u201d said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas. The analysis comes as federal agents and analysts are scrambling to review\u00a0emails found on a laptop used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin , one of Clinton\u2019s closest aides. Agents came across Abedin\u2019s correspondence while searching the computer for evidence that the disgraced former lawmaker may have violated federal laws when exchanging sexually explicit messages with a 15-year-old girl. During its nearly yearlong probe, the FBI interviewed dozens of witnesses, conducted forensic tests and examined\u00a0tens of thousands of messages that passed through the private email server used by Clinton and some of her aides while she was secretary of State. In the end, agents uncovered classified information\u00a0in 193 emails that were part of 81 email chains, though none of the emails were marked with a classified header. Of those chains, the department concluded that eight should have been treated as top secret, the highest level of classification, the FBI reported. Election 2016 \u00a0|\u00a0 Live coverage on Trail Guide \u00a0|\u00a0 Sign up for the newsletter \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo\u00a0if there were 100 examples of classified information before and now they find 10 more, how is that going to change the analysis?\u201d asked Peter Zeidenberg , a former federal prosecutor who signed a public letter critical of Comey\u2019s decision last week to publicly reveal the new inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s the same question. It\u2019s the same issue. That\u2019s even\u00a0assuming the emails they find on the laptop are classified emails. There may all be duplicates, or emails that don\u2019t have any classified information. We don\u2019t know.\u201d And even if agents discover evidence that warrants\u00a0an indictment,\u00a0Comey\u2019s past public statements could undermine a future prosecution,\u00a0legal experts said. Defense lawyers would certainly seek all records associated with his public announcement in July, when he declared Clinton\u2019s actions were \u201ccareless\u201d but not criminal. An about-face by the FBI\u00a0would permit defense attorneys to attack the thoroughness of the entire investigation, pointing out that it failed to turn up Abedin\u2019s emails on a laptop she shared with her husband. \u201cA classic defense in any criminal case is to accuse the investigating law enforcement agents of \u2018shoddy police work.\u2019\u201d said Mary Pat Brown, a former federal prosecutor.\u00a0\u201cWhen there are inconsistencies in the evidence itself, or any delays or missteps in collecting evidence, the government\u2019s case is vulnerable to attack.\u201d FBI accelerated its timeline for reviewing emails potentially linked to Hillary Clinton on Monday amid growing public pressure over the agency\u2019s surprise announcement that it had found them in an unrelated case.

The FBI accelerated its timeline for reviewing emails potentially linked to Hillary Clinton on Monday amid growing public pressure over the agency\u2019s surprise announcement that it had found them in an unrelated case. Investigators had planned to conduct the review over several weeks but, after a... (Del Quentin Wilber and Noah Bierman) Comey\u2019s unusual move to publicly discuss the case with reporters and Congress in\u00a0July\u00a0was in part\u00a0to demonstrate that the bureau\u2019s inquiry was \u00a0meticulous and independent. But Vladeck agreed his action could now backfire. \u201cThose statements make it difficult for there ever to be a prosecution,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cComey laid a trap for himself in July.\u201d Perceptions that the new emails won\u2019t dramatically change the case are part of the reason Clinton supporters were so incensed by Comey\u2019s surprise and vague announcement last week that the bureau would examine the materials over the coming weeks. Agents are hoping to have a preliminary assessment\u00a0of the Abedin emails completed by election day, though it remains unclear whether the FBI will make a further public statement about the case, despite calls for more information from both Democrats and Republicans. Agents will need to sort out Abedin\u2019s emails, discard duplicates and then examine what\u2019s left to\u00a0see if anything is relevant to the Clinton inquiry, a federal law enforcement official said. The laptop contains hundreds of thousands of emails \u2014\u00a0most of them Weiner\u2019s \u2014\u00a0and it will take weeks to fully vet them, the official said.

The latest revelations come after the FBI revealed on Friday it was reviewing a new batch of emails that appeared to be \"pertinent\" to their suspended investigation into Clinton's use of a private server \u2014 and multiple federal sources told NBC News they were found as part of an ongoing probe into Weiner's alleged illicit communication with an underage girl. The FBI did not describe the nature of the emails. FBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch speak to the media at the Justice Department in Washington on Nov. 19, 2015. Yuri Gripas / REUTERS file The Justice Department originally was opposed to the FBI's plan to notify Congress about the discovery of the new emails, according to senior officials familiar with the discussions. However, Comey concluded that it was better to inform Congress sooner rather than wait until after the election. \"In the end, we decided it was better to keep Congress informed,\" an FBI official involved in the process told NBC News on Saturday. Weiner is the estranged husband of Abedin. The emails, the sources said, were found on the household laptop. Abedin, through her lawyer, said she would cooperate with authorities but has not yet been contacted by the FBI. She said she found out from press reports that the FBI was looking at emails on her husband's laptop. Halimah Abdullah ",

The tweet has since been deleted.

(Photo: Suzanne Cordeiro, AFP/Getty Images) 97 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE AUSTIN \u2014 A tweet sent from Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller's account that called Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton the c-word was sent by a staffer , his office said late Tuesday afternoon. The tweet from the account @MillerForTexas had results from an Pennsylvania Auto Alliance poll showing candidate Donald Trump ahead of Clinton. In the tweet, Miller had the c-word in place of Clinton's name. The tweet was part of a series of tweets regarding poll results. The tweet was taken down minutes after it was posted and another tweet was sent out saying that Miller's account had been hacked. That, too, was deleted later. In a phone interview WFAA-TV, Dallas-Fort Worth, Miller said he asked his campaign staffers to \"find some stuff and retweet it.\" \u201cThey put some interesting polling numbers up but didn't read it close enough. It had a derogatory term in it,\" Miller said. \"A term I would never use or never use and don't condone, a term that a Texas gentlemen would never use. And it got out. When we found out about it we took it down.\u201d Miller, a co-chairman of Trump's agriculture advisory committee, called the word \"deplorable\" and \"despicable.\" He added that he never saw the tweet his staff sent. \u201cI'll just say this. The staff has been dealt with. And I bet it doesn't happen again,\" Miller said about disciplining his staff. A Miller spokesman also provided this statement: \u201cThe campaign was retweeting information on Twitter today and inadvertently retweeted a tweet that they were not aware contained a derogatory term. The tweet was taken down as soon as possible. Commissioner Miller finds the term vulgar and offensive and apologizes to anyone who may have seen it.\u201d The episode drew a stern rebuke from a fellow Republican, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. \"The language is reprehensible and is an embarrassment,\" Abbott said in a statement to the Texas Tribune . \"No true Texas gentleman would ever talk this way.\" Follow Jason Puckett on Twitter:\u00a0 @JasonP_KVUE 97 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eUXRVt ",

The Cubs and Indians play Game 6 of the World Series on Tuesday night. If the Indians win, the Cleveland players become heroes forever in their city, ending a decades-long title drought and securing late-night TV appearances and free drinks and a White House visit. If the Cubs win, they buy themselves the chance to earn all those same things on Wednesday in Game 7. But six guys spread out around Progressive Field on Tuesday night will endeavor Game 6 seeking no such glory. Like the players, they represent the best in the world at their profession and, in the World Series, they are called upon to perform under unspeakable pressure. But the best any umpire can hope to achieve on Tuesday is for no one to notice him at all. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about the pressure, you\u2019ve got the wrong job,\u201d MLB umpiring director and former ump Randy Marsh told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cTo me, the pressure\u2019s the same as it is opening day \u2014 I want to get every pitch right. It\u2019s not any different when you\u2019re working the World Series.\u201d (Tommy Gilligan/USA TODAY Sports) The proliferation of high-definition video review and PitchF/X-type strike zone readouts prompt some to argue that MLB umpires have somehow gotten worse in recent years, a bafflingly illogical conclusion in a highly competitive baseball landscape changed daily by new technologies for assessing the performance of just about everyone. The umpires working the World Series represent the best of the best. \u201cThese guys are evaluated every game they work all season long,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cTheir strike zone is evaluated, all the plays they call on the field, how they handle situations \u2014 arguments and things like that, how they handle that. They get mid-year evaluations, they get year-end evaluations. In September, we bring our supervisors in and meet with (MLB chief baseball officer) Joe Torre and (VP of baseball operations) Peter Woodfork, and we go over the entire staff, all 76 names. \u201cWe have video review on all the calls they make, and we have the computer systems as far as plate work is concerned. The day after they work the plate, they get a readout on every pitch that they actually called. It\u2019ll tell them if they called a pitch two and a half inches outside, or it\u2019ll tell them if this pitch was inside the zone and they called it a ball.\u201d In September, the league selects four crews\u2019 worth of umpires to work the Divisional Series round. Two separate crews umpire the LCS series. The seven umps who rotate through the six postseason umpiring positions during World Series play all worked LDS games but not LCS contests, an effort made to find a balance between rust and fatigue. All umps receive postseason bonuses now, but working the World Series brings a larger one, and getting tapped for the job represents a big honor. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) \u201cJoe Torre refers to the World Series as the crown jewel of baseball, and being selected as an umpire for the World Series \u2014 that\u2019s the crown jewel selection,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. A lot of guys want that.\u201d Earlier this postseason, a lovely moment caught on camera between Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and home-plate umpire Angel Hernandez blew up online. Rizzo had assumed a pitch was ball four and began walking toward first when Hernandez called him back, and the slugger later apologized for inadvertently \u201cshowing up\u201d Hernandez. After the game, Rizzo pointed out something that rarely registers with fans: Umpiring a full baseball season is an extraordinarily taxing job. \u201cAll of the umpires are out here at the highest level, doing their best,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re out here working their tails off for 162 (games) like we are. There\u2019s no home for them. They\u2019re on the road the entire season.\u201d This moment between the @Cubs Anthony Rizzo and umpire Angel Hernandez is what sports is all about https://t.co/v0HoGHX0mL \u2014 Luis Antonio Perez (@NorthsideLou) October 20, 2016 It\u2019s true: While MLB players get to play half their games in one location, umpires travel constantly throughout the season. Across the course of the six-month regular season, they get four one-week breaks. And while Marsh said many umpires make their homes someplace near a big-league city, they\u2019re unlikely to be there for more than a couple of series a season. Marsh hails from a Cincinnati suburb in Northern Kentucky, and could recall a season in which he worked only three Reds home games all year. Naturally, umpiring has changed a lot in the last couple of seasons thanks to the dawn of the league\u2019s replay review system. Marsh said umps were resistant to the change at first \u2014 sensitive about having their calls overturned, and hesitant to overturn their fellow umps\u2019 calls during their turns overseeing replays. But replay, the umps found, saves them from the burden of botching a decisive call in a big game. \u201cThey realized it\u2019s for the betterment of the game,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cAlso, if you\u2019re an umpire and they\u2019ve changed your call, nine times out of ten it\u2019s not even written about in the paper. There\u2019s a call at first base that was overturned; the umpire\u2019s not out there hanging on a limb and getting ripped apart. Also, because they were able to do that, it didn\u2019t affect the outcome of the game \u2014 that\u2019s the important thing.\u201d During his career as an active umpire, Marsh worked five World Series and nine League Championship Series. During the 2004 LCS between the Red Sox and Yankees, he initially missed a call on a controversial play that he believes led to umpires more frequently conferring on the field to ensure accuracy. \u201cIt was the A-Rod play in Boston, where he slapped the glove,\u201d Marsh said, referring to the 2004 incident in which Alex Rodriguez intentionally knocked the ball away from Bronson Arroyo along the first-base line. \u201cI was at first base, and Mientkiewicz was at first base, the second baseman came over to cover, I had two people in front of me, I didn\u2019t see it. Joe West was the plate umpire, Jeff Kellogg was there, and they said Randy, he slapped it. I said, I\u2019ve got to change this. The thing was, the media supported me completely \u2014 even in New York, they knew that what he had done was wrong. In part it was embarrassing, but the other part was we got it right. And (former MLB exec) Sandy Alderson was our boss at the time; he could not have been happier. I think ever since then, umpires have been more receptive to saying, let\u2019s get together and get this call right.\u201d Umpires in 2016 face perhaps more scrutiny than ever before, especially when behind the plate. Fans and analysts armed with strike-zone plots can identify immediately if an umpire called a strike an inch below the zone or squeezed a pitcher on a fastball that nipped the outside corner. And pitchers throw harder than ever before. Perhaps as soon as tonight, a home-plate ump will need to determine whether a 102.5-mph fastball from Aroldis Chapman caught the top part of the strike zone or sailed an inch too high, and if he gets it wrong, he will be lambasted for it. Marsh said that umpires provide a support system for one another, and noted that many dedicated baseball fans do appreciate the difficulty of officiating a game. But when asked if he thought most people recognize how hard it is to be an umpire, he was unequivocal. \u201cGuys come to umpire school, and they think anybody can get behind the plate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time they get behind there at umpire school and the balls coming in at 50 mph, they\u2019re diving out of the way. \u201cThey have no idea.\u201d This year\u2019s World Series umpires are crew chief John Hirschbeck, Chris Guccione, Sam Holbrook, Marvin Hudson, Tony Randazzo, Larry Vanover and Joe West. If all goes well for them, you won\u2019t hear their names again in 2016. More MLB! ",

City Council approves Frank Gehry's project on the Sunset Strip 8150 Sunset Gehry Partners, LLP The Los Angeles City Council voted 13-0 Tuesday to approve a mixed-use development designed by Frank Gehry at Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards. Above, a model rendering of the project. The Los Angeles City Council voted 13-0 Tuesday to approve a mixed-use development designed by Frank Gehry at Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards. Above, a model rendering of the project. (Gehry Partners, LLP) Alice Walton Contact Reporter The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a mixed-use development designed by Frank Gehry that will anchor the eastern edge of the Sunset Strip.\u00a0 The relatively swift approval of the project Tuesday was a contrast to last week\u2019s three-hour discussion on the famed architect\u2019s design for 8150 Sunset Blvd. The five-building complex at Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards will include two residential towers, terraced gardens and a shopping center.\u00a0 Elected officials for both Los Angeles and West Hollywood as well as some neighborhood groups had voiced concern about the project, which originally included a 234-foot-tall tower. Critics believed the tower would be out of scale with the neighborhood. Others worried the project would bring too much traffic to an already busy intersection.\u00a0 Why a Frank Gehry project on the Sunset Strip doesn't appeal to some Hollywood residents A proposal for two towers, one rising 15 stories, terraced gardens and 334,000 square feet of retail is meeting stiff resistance from Hollywood\u00a0residents. A proposal for two towers, one rising 15 stories, terraced gardens and 334,000 square feet of retail is meeting stiff resistance from Hollywood\u00a0residents. See more videos But at last week\u2019s Planning and Land Use Management Committee meeting , the developer, Townscape Partners, agreed to reduce its tallest tower to 178 feet and\u00a0add more affordable housing and more parking spaces. It will also provide $2 million to ease traffic congestion. The project will have 229 residential units, including 38 for low-income families. There will be 65,000 square feet of commercial space and a pedestrian plaza.\u00a0 Many of those changes came after the area\u2019s councilman, David Ryu, released a lengthy letter outlining his concerns over the density and height of the development.\u00a0 \u201cCompromise is never easy but it\u2019s a core value of our city and democracy,\u201d said Ryu, who represents this stretch of the Sunset Strip. \u201cWhile this compromise isn\u2019t perfect, 8150 Sunset Blvd. is a much better project today.\u201d\u00a0 One issue that has yet to be decided is what will happen with the Lytton Savings building on the project site. The building, which is currently a Chase bank, was designed by architect\u00a0Kurt Meyer in 1960. It was nominated for historic-cultural landmark status but council members have delayed a vote on its landmark status until November.\u00a0 If the City Council votes to preserve the bank building, it could be incorporated into Gehry\u2019s design or moved to a new location.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss What the FBI would have to find to press charges against Hillary Clinton , Frank Gehry\u2019s controversial development is approved , two Des Moines officers were shot to death , and the Cubs push a game 7 of the World Series .

    "text": "Paige St. John Contact Reporter Barely a year after the largest methane leak in U.S. history, and with two-thirds of its wells still shut down, operators of the Aliso Canyon storage field want to pump gas again. Southern California Gas Co. on Tuesday asked California regulators for permission to resume pumping pressurized natural gas into the ground northeast of Los Angeles, at a depleted oil field now used for storage. Records show the utility has been negotiating this step with regulators for several weeks. The company cited \"extensive physical upgrades\" and \"advanced technologies\" in contending it would be safe to resume operations. Local political leaders immediately disagreed. \"Since the multiple investigations into the cause of the leak have not been completed, we must proceed with extreme caution. Aliso Canyon is not ready to resume normal operations,\" U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said in a statement urging that the gas company be restricted to minimal operations required to prevent power interruptions. The storage field is a primary supplier to gas-powered electric plants. Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich introduced a motion, to be taken up by the board next week, asking state utility regulators to continue to prohibit gas injection at Aliso Canyon pending a review of whether the field can be permanently closed.\u00a0Legislation passed in May requires such a review before mid-2017. The Aliso Canyon leak began in October 2015 when high-pressure gas escaped from a well deep below ground and found its way to the surface. The blowout took five months to plug, forcing thousands of residents in nearby communities such as Porter Ranch to evacuate their homes. A report on what caused the failure has yet to be completed. In the aftermath, California regulators required Southern California Gas to test the remaining 114 active wells before returning the storage field to use. The state\u00a0adopted rules (which in May became state law)\u00a0that allow the field to reopen with only some wells operable. Only 29 wells have passed all the inspections required to return to use. State reports show 80 wells, many dating to the 1950s, have been plugged and taken out of operation. The gas company has a year to either repair and fully test those wells or abandon them. Preliminary test results showed a number of wells in the field -- originally drilled to produce oil and later converted for gas storage -- had underground leaks. Field operators are not required to report how much gas is lost in below-ground leaks. State environmental regulators said it could take weeks to decide on the gas company's request. State inspections at the field are still pending and state utility regulators must concur with reopening the field. \u00a0 \u201cSafety is our top priority. We will thoroughly review all the information and data, conduct independent site inspections, seek public feedback and the opinion of outside experts before making any determination,\" state Oil and Gas Supervisor Ken Harris said in a\u00a0statement. Originally, the gas company said its inability to use Aliso Canyon would interrupt power supplies during the summer.\u00a0\"However, warnings of rolling blackouts and energy shortages during the summer never came to fruition,\" Antonovich said in his motion.\u00a0 A federal task force formed in the wake of the Aliso Canyon leak last month called for safety precautions that include the use of outer casings to contain possible leaks. Southern California Gas had a practice of boosting well production at Aliso Canyon and other fields by pumping gas through both the interior pipe and external casing. The U.S. Department of Transportation also is reviewing national standards governing some 400 underground gas storage facilities in the United States. That ruling is expected this year. The gas company, a division of Sempra Energy, is defending itself against some 180 lawsuits over the leak. It has estimated costs of lost gas, plugging the leak and housing for about 8,000 area residents at about\u00a0$717 million.
