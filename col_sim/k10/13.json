    "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo A doorman at Trump Tower on Friday. Donald J. Trump\u2019s apartment is 58 floors up, and a designated elevator takes him from there to his office on the 26th floor. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times President-elect Donald J. Trump won the White House with an outsider\u2019s populist promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington. Now, as he prepares to assume the presidency, an open question remains about the capital he repeatedly spurned: Just how much is he willing to become a part of it? Mr. Trump, a homebody who often flew several hours late at night during the campaign so he could wake up in his own bed in Trump Tower, is talking with his advisers about how many nights a week he will spend in the White House. He has told them he would like to do what he is used to, which is spending time in New York when he can. The future first lady, Melania Trump, expects to move to Washington. But the couple\u2019s 10-year-old son, Barron, is midway through a school year in New York, and it is unclear when the move would happen. The questions reflect what Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers described as the president-elect\u2019s coming to grips with the fact that his life is about to change radically. They say that Mr. Trump, who was shocked when he won the election, might spend most of the week in Washington, much like members of Congress, and return to Trump Tower or his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., or his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on weekends. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hanging on to the familiar for presidents-elect and their families is not unusual. There were early questions about whether Michelle Obama would leave Chicago and move to the White House in early 2009 and disrupt her daughters\u2019 school years, but the whole family moved in the day of the inaugural. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers hold out the possibility that the president-elect may spend more time in the White House as he grows less overwhelmed and more comfortable in the job. Still, Mr. Trump has spent the last three decades, for the most part, cosseted within Trump Tower. His apartment is on the 58th floor, and a designated elevator takes him from there to his office on the 26th floor. He wakes at 5 o\u2019clock most mornings, reads The New York Post, The New York Times and a handful of other newspapers, and tunes into the morning television news shows. In the final months of the campaign, he would hang around his apartment until about 10 a.m., joining his aides in the office later. Mr. Trump\u2019s affection for his penthouse apartment runs deep, as his biographer, Michael D\u2019Antonio , learned when Mr. Trump invited him inside the three-story unit in 2014 for an extended interview. Photo The future president-elect in Trump Tower in 2015. His affection for his penthouse apartment there runs deep. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times Mr. Trump reveled in recalling the challenges required to design and build the apartment, decorated in 24-karat gold and marble in the Louis XIV style, saying he simply wanted to see if such an ambitious undertaking could be accomplished. He described it less as a home than a tribute to his own self-image. \u201cI really wanted to see if it could be done,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time, as he showed Mr. D\u2019Antonio around the apartment. \u201cThis is a very complex unit. Building this unit, if you look at the columns and the carvings, this building, this unit was harder than building the building itself.\u201d Yet after meeting with President Obama on Thursday and touring the White House, Mr. Trump, according to two people briefed on his thinking, was taken with that building over all and marveled at the neoclassical architecture and history.

Moore, who publicly predicted Trump would win the election, entered the Trump Tower shortly after 1 p.m. wearing a red San Francisco 49ers hat, seemingly with the goal of riding the elevator in the building. There had been a Trump protest going on outside the building, he said according to the report. \"I just thought I'd see if I could get into Trump Tower and ride the famous elevator.\" Moore was carrying a smartphone to film a Facebook Live broadcast\u00a0or live transmission on the social networking site. \"We'll see, maybe if he'll let me in this office.\" Moore took a series of escalators\u00a0telling those gathered around that \"calling it gives me no pleasure,\" in connection with the fact he had predicted\u00a0months ago that Trump would win the election. While moving toward the fourth floor of the building to reach the elevators, Moore criticized the Electoral College system, which allows a candidate to win the election even if the person\u00a0trails with the popular vote. Secretary Hillary Clinton lost the election based on electoral votes\u00a0but did win the most votes. The Secret Service stopped Moore at the fourth floor, telling him he could not use the elevator or go any higher. Moore then descended back down the escalators and left a note with the doorman for Trump. \"Mr. Trump. I'm here. I want to talk to you,\" the note said.

    "text": "Read the story \u201cThis is hard to take in.\u00a0I mean, it bothered me what he said about deporting 11 million illegal immigrants and all the offensive things he has said about everyone, including women.\u201d Demonstrations also took place in other cities Saturday including New York, where thousands of marchers headed to Trump Tower, closing off streets and causing gridlock in parts of Manhattan. This is the first large\u00a0daytime protest in L.A. since Trump was elected. The other\u00a0protests\u00a0occurred at night and resulted in some clashes. Los Angeles police have arrested hundreds of people over the last few days, including on Wednesday night when some demonstrators blocked lanes on the 101 Freeway. Nearly 200 anti-Trump protesters were arrested in downtown Los Angeles early Saturday morning after refusing the LAPD\u2019s order to disperse. One undercover LAPD officer was assaulted on Thursday night. Saturday\u2019s march was reminiscent in some ways of the series of huge immigration protests that hit Los Angeles a decade ago. Fueled by hard-line proposals in Congress regarding immigrants here illegally, nearly 500,000 people marched through downtown L.A. in 2006. California is a likely\u00a0battleground as Trump crafts his immigration policy. Trump said during the presidential campaign that he would build a wall along the\u00a0 U.S.-Mexico\u00a0border \u00a0and deport people in the country illegally. He is expected to unwind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an initiative by President Obama that protects immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. But California has some of the nation\u2019s \u00a0most liberal policies when \u00a0it comes to handling immigrants here illegally. The state has allowed them to get driver\u2019s licenses, health coverage for children and in-state tuition. Institutions like churches also support immigrants. Trump made illegal immigration a central issue of his campaign, arguing that people here without proper documentation are a drain on the economy and take jobs away from U.S. citizens. Trump has not outlined any specific immigration policies since winning the election. But Kris Kobach, Kansas secretary of state and a member of Trump\u2019s immigration policy transition team, \u00a0told The Times \u00a0that the U.S. could easily boost deportations by more than 75% in his first year in office. Experts have said Trump could also reduce or slow down the process by which Mexicans get travel cards and visitor visas. But other Trump immigration ideas \u2014 such as building a massive wall along the border \u2014 are probably going to be more difficult to implement, they said. The Saturday protest began to wind down in the afternoon, though another round of night marches was\u00a0possible. As many left, a\u00a0few hundred lingering protesters gathered on the steps of City Hall to share\u00a0their thoughts on the election. Passing a megaphone among\u00a0them, some demonstrators\u00a0talked about the importance of finding a direction forward, others said they wanted a female\u00a0president, and still others admitted to feeling as if they had let\u00a0 Hillary Clinton \u00a0down. One woman, who said she was transgender, warned listeners against getting violent. \u201cIf we get violent, we get stopped,\u201d\u00a0she said. A man urged the group to sign a petition on MoveOn.org to abolish the electoral college. \u201cTrump didn't win the popular vote,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cI don't understand why we aren't pushing that harder.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss ",

Amy Adams in a scene from \"Arrival.\" The Paramount Pictures thriller beat expectations during its opening weekend at the box office. (Jan Thijs / Paramount Pictures) Paramount\u2019s sci-fi thriller \u201cArrival\u201d landed in the No. 3 spot on the weekend box-office chart and beat expectations, while Marvel Studio\u2019s \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d held on to the top spot for the second weekend in a row. 20th Century Fox\u2019s animated \u201cTrolls\u201d stayed put at No. 2. \u201cArrival\u201d brought in an estimated $9.4 million on Friday, which far exceeded pre-release\u00a0estimates that the film, which stars Amy Adams , would earn only around $16 million for the weekend. The performance is a welcome relief for Paramount, which has been plagued with several lackluster showings, including \u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d and \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.\u201d \"Doctor Strange,\" which is distributed by Disney, grossed nearly $15 million Friday for a domestic total of nearly $125 million. The film starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role of the powerful sorcerer has benefited from positive word of mouth, including an A CinemaScore from audiences and a 90% fresh rating from Rotten Tomatoes. Kids and their parents continued to flock to DreamWorks Animation's \u201cTrolls,\u201d which stars Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake as creatures of opposite nature united in a quest to save their best pals. The film grossed $12.2 million Friday, giving it a domestic total just shy of $71.2 million. \u201cArrival\u201d is now projected to earn between $21\u00a0million and $24 million during its opening weekend, according to Box Office Mojo . The film, directed by Denis Villeneuve, stars Adams as a U.S. military linguist picked to communicate with aliens. The thoughtful sci-fi drama\u00a0has been racking up favorable reviews, including a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a B CinemaScore. Two other new releases, Universal\u2019s \u201cAlmost Christmas\u201d and EuropaCorp\u2019s \u201cShut In,\u201d finished at No. 4 and No. 7, respectively, with the former grossing $5.9 million Friday and the latter $1.4 million. It appears the feel-good holiday film starring Danny Glover was more attractive to audiences than a dark thriller on the weekend after a tough presidential election.

He was doing it because he was mad and he was hurt,\u201d she added. \u201cGiven what your son has admitted, your son is the definition of what\u2019s known as a serial killer,\u201d Begnaud pointed out. \u201cI hate that,\u201d Tague said, choking up. \u201cI know that\u2019s what they say\u2026 he was a very misunderstood.\u201d But Sheriff\u2019s deputies say there\u2019s no misunderstanding. Kohlhepp is responsible for at least seven murders. His dark past came to light when 30-year-old Brown was found on Kohlhepp\u2019s property. She and her boyfriend Charlie Carver were missing for two months. \u201cShe was banging very hard on the container,\u201d Spartanburg Sheriff Chuck Wright said. \u201cShe was bound. There was a chain from the top of the cage to something else that went around her neck. She was distraught, panicked.\u201d Her boyfriend Charlie Carver was not as fortunate.\u00a0 \u201cShe said she witnessed him being shot,\u201d Wright said. After being taken into custody, Kohlhepp asked to speak to his mother. She said he told her everything and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mom.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cDid he cry?\u201d Begnaud said. \u201cMmmhmm,\u201d Tague said. \u201cHis eyes looked horrible. They were red.\u201d \u201cWhy did he kill her boyfriend?\u201d Begnaud asked. \u201cBecause he got nasty and got smart-mouthed,\u201d Tague said. \u201cWhy did he chain that girl up?\u201d Begnaud asked. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t know what to do at that point,\u201d Tague said. \u201cShe saw, evidently, him kill her boyfriend, and he didn\u2019t know what to do with her, he couldn\u2019t turn her loose. She\u2019d go get the police,\u201d Tague said. Last Saturday Kohlepp took Sheriff Wright to his property. He showed him where he had buried Carver and two drifters he murdered after allegedly hiring them to work on his property.\u00a0 \u201cHe was very polite and remorseful, actually. I said a prayer with him,\u201d Wright said. What would take everyone by surprise was when Kohlepp also admitted to gunning down four people in a notorious cold case that became known as the Superbike Murders. Kohlhepp had wanted to return a motorcycle. \u201cThey laughed at him, made jokes at him,\u201d Tague said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s hurt. He hurt everybody,\u201d Tague said of her son. ",

By Philip Rucker , Dana Priest and Karen DeYoung November 12 at 6:07 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @karendeyoung1 Nowhere did Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy inspire more trepidation or alarm than in the national security community, inhabited by many Republicans who vehemently denounced their party\u2019s nominee as dangerously unfit to be commander in chief. Now, as President-elect Trump begins assembling his government, scores of former senior national security officials, foreign policy specialists and career civil servants are wrestling with a dilemma: refuse government service or join the administration of the 45th president? Whether these seasoned experts step forward to help \u2014 and whether Trump accepts them into his administration \u2014 will send a powerful signal about the new president\u2019s intentions and ability to broaden his sphere of influencers beyond the loyalists who helped steer him to an improbable triumph in the election. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for the intelligence guys to be professional and to suck it up,\u201d said Charles Allen, who served nearly five decades in the CIA and is the unofficial dean of former intelligence community officials. \u201cWe work for the president and the Congress, and that\u2019s all we do. We\u2019re capable, and we have to do our job.\u201d While most pronounced in the national security realm, this dynamic is evident throughout Trump\u2019s transition, which is tasked with filling about 4,100 federal jobs. Washington\u2019s officialdom is waiting with nervous anticipation for Trump\u2019s first appointments, especially those in the West Wing who would serve as the president\u2019s gatekeepers. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to \"drain the swamp\" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) Does the president-elect install as White House chief of staff a broadly acceptable insider such as Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who was recommended by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.)? Or does he choose an antagonistic ideologue \u2014 perhaps Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign chief executive who assailed the congressional leadership as chairman of Breitbart News? Does he tap a sober-minded consensus choice such as Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.) as secretary of state or a combustible Trump confidant such as former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani or former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who are both said to be eyeing the diplomatic post? Does Trump appoint industry lobbyists and forsake his pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interests? [ Donors and lobbyists already shaping Trump\u2019s \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 administration ] \u201cPersonnel is policy,\u201d said Scott Reed, a Washington establishment fixture and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s top political strategist. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be watching those first couple of appointments. It will set the tone on what kind of relationship the president-elect will have with the town.\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Saturday that a chief of staff announcement was \u201cimminent,\u201d telling reporters that Priebus was interested in the job and is one of several candidates Trump is considering. So far, Trump has sent mixed signals. He selected Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is regarded as an advocate of inclusion and a bridge to the Washington establishment and conservative think tanks, to lead the transition. He has populated his transition teams with experienced hands for areas including national security, intelligence and military. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get in an echo chamber, where you only have \u2018yes\u2019 people and you don\u2019t have any contrary thinking,\u201d said former Republican congressman Benjamin Quayle. The Post\u2019s Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s advisers said the president-elect is mindful of the importance of cultivating strong relationships with the Republican-led Senate and House to pass his ambitious agenda, including a tax overhaul and a sweeping infrastructure program. To that end, he tapped Rick Dearborn, a former chief of staff to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) who is well known to lawmakers, as transition director. And Eric Ueland, a veteran Senate staffer who runs the Senate Budget Committee, has been mentioned as a likely pick to head Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget. There is talk among people familiar with the effort that Trump is open to tapping a Democrat to fill at least one Cabinet position \u2014 perhaps as secretary of transportation, a nonideological post for which President Obama chose Republican Ray LaHood and George W. Bush chose Democrat Norman Y. Mineta. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, seem to be swooning at the unexpected opportunity to govern, though they could easily become alienated. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone with giddy Republicans for about 48\u00a0hours now,\u201d Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said. \u201cEverybody assumed we\u2019d come back and be the firewall [against a President Hillary Clinton], and now we see the opportunity to be the point of the spear.\u201d [ Trump maps out a new administration to bring a seismic shift to Washington ] \u2018It\u2019s their duty\u2019 Some of the Republican national security figures who signed a public letter condemning Trump during the campaign said they would never serve in his administration, and they could be blacklisted anyway. But even they have been counseling others that serving might be the right thing to do for the country. As the seriousness of governing subsumes the vitriol of the campaign, a dozen national security experts interviewed said they believed experienced people will resume their roles as apolitical professionals and be willing to join the administration. \u201cI know many of those people, and some would be sufficiently patriotic to think it\u2019s their duty,\u201d said Jeffrey H. Smith, former CIA general counsel and head of Arnold & Porter\u2019s national security law practice. \u201cIt\u2019s just too important.\u201d Eliot Cohen, who served as counselor to former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, was a driving force behind an open letter last spring , eventually signed by 122 Republican national security leaders who opposed Trump\u2019s candidacy and pledged not to serve in a Trump administration. In an essay titled \u201cTo An Anxious Friend,\u201d published Thursday in the American Interest, Cohen advised career military, diplomatic and intelligence officials to \u201ccontinue to do their jobs.\u201d \u201cThe government has to be staffed,\u201d wrote Cohen, who is director of the strategic studies program at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. Those accepting, he wrote, should understand the limits of their influence and the extent to which the administration is \u201clikely to be torn by infighting and bureaucratic skulduggery.\u201d They should say yes, he said, \u201cwith two conditions . . . that they keep a signed but undated letter of resignation in their desk . . . and that they not recant a word of what they have said thus far.\u201d Susan Hennessey, a fellow at Brookings and former attorney at the National Security Agency, said many of her friends who are career national security officers are trying to decide whether to remain in their jobs. \u201cIf you are a person who believes that Donald Trump threatens the very institution and poses a real threat to American security abroad because he is inexperienced and undisciplined, is it your duty to not participate or is it your duty to serve in hopes of providing him wise counsel?\u201d she asked. [ How Donald Trump won: The insiders tell their story ] The leadership of Trump\u2019s national security transition team includes former Republican officials and retired military officers well within the boundaries of the conservative mainstream. The team is headed by former Army lieutenant general Ronald L. Burgess Jr., a previous Defense Intelligence Agency director, and Mike Rogers, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman. Other players include retired one-star general Michael Meese, a protege of David H. Petraeus in Iraq and Afghanistan; Mira Ricardel, a veteran of the Pentagon; retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg, an early Trump supporter; and James Carafano, another retired military officer. Others, particularly among those who have been active on Trump\u2019s campaign, have engendered more skepticism. Since the election, some have already made policy statements causing concern \u2014 and creating uncertainty as to whether they are speaking for the incoming administration. Michael T. Flynn, the retired three-star general who often served as a Trump surrogate and a member of the 16-member top advisory group, on Election Day criticized Obama\u2019s policy on Turkey, a key but troubling ally in the fight against the Islamic State. The United States, Flynn said in an opinion column published in the Hill, should show Turkey who its \u201creal friends\u201d are by extraditing the U.S. resident and Muslim cleric responsible, according to Ankara, for last summer\u2019s coup attempt there. Because Turkey is such a crucial ally, Flynn wrote, the U.S. government should also stem its official criticism of the country\u2019s crackdown on perceived political opponents. The Obama administration has said there will be no political interference in the Justice Department\u2019s consideration of Turkey\u2019s request to extradite Fethullah Gulen. On Thursday, Jason Greenblatt, named by Trump as one of his top advisers on Israel, said in Israeli radio interviews that the president-elect does not view Israeli settlements on Palestinian land as \u201can obstacle to peace.\u201d Trump says the United States should not impose its own views on the issue, Greenblatt said, and should leave the two sides to work it out themselves. U.S. policy under Obama has been sharply critical of the expanding settlements, which have been internationally condemned as illegal. [ Trump and aides hedge on major pledges, including Obamacare and the wall ] Trump is widely expected to reward his loyalists with plum posts. People familiar with preliminary talks said Giuliani is said to favor secretary of state but also is under consideration for attorney general and secretary of homeland security. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also is in the mix for attorney general and secretary of state, as well as commerce secretary. And Gingrich could end up in any of a wide range of roles across foreign or domestic policy. \u2018Managers and ideologues\u2019 One factor contributing to the uncertainty is that the transition\u2019s center of gravity is not in Washington, where the government provides office space, but at Trump Tower, the president-elect\u2019s midtown Manhattan skyscraper. His three oldest children \u2014 and especially his son-in-law, Jared Kushner \u2014 are exerting great influence over the early deliberations, as are many of his campaign loyalists, including Bannon and major donor Rebekah Mercer. Darrell M. West, who heads governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said what he sees so far from the Trump transition is \u201cschizophrenia. . . . When you look at the names being floated, it\u2019s a mix of managers and ideologues.\u201d In his transition\u2019s first week, Trump has not announced any appointments. In 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named his White House chief of staff \u2014 then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.) \u2014 two days after the election. Trump\u2019s transition team, which had been led by Christie, has been at work since the summer. But many members did not expect Trump to win and are only now delving into the serious work of assembling the administration and mapping out a detailed agenda to launch after Trump\u2019s Jan.\u00a020 inauguration. \u201cIt\u2019s like the dog chasing the bus and we\u2019ve finally caught it, so now we have to figure out what to do,\u201d said one Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because transition talks are confidential. For Trump, history offers different guides. President Ronald Reagan reached outside his inner circle of ideological Californians and brought in pragmatist James A. Baker III, who had run two primary campaigns against him, as his White House chief of staff. President Bill Clinton staged a splashy transition, promising a Cabinet that would \u201clook like America.\u201d But in the end, he stacked his White House with longtime friends \u2014 Thomas F. \u201cMack\u201d McLarty III, a kindergarten classmate, became chief of staff \u2014 and went on to have a chaotic first year. The first glimmer of how President George W. Bush\u2019s administration would run came when he empowered his No.\u00a02, Richard B. Cheney, to assemble the government. With the outcome of the 2000 election still in doubt pending a Florida recount and a Supreme Court ruling, Cheney did so from the kitchen table at his townhouse in McLean, Va., and populated the administration with his own allies. Meanwhile, Obama, anxious to avoid Clinton\u2019s mistakes, worked from the inside out. He put much of his early focus on filling jobs in the White House, led by the wily Emanuel, which foreshadowed a tightly centralized presidency.

Too many African-Americans have been left behind.\u201d It proposes to change the condition of black communities by promoting school choice, reduction of crime, business tax cuts, financial reforms, stopping \u201ctrade deficits,\u201d ending illegal immigration, new infrastructure investment, protections for \u201cthe African American church\u201d and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy. Trump on speaking with the Clintons While much of Trump\u2019s plan already exists as part of his general legislative agenda, it also includes policies specific to inner cities, where he would ramp up law enforcement and look to increase investments. \u201cWe will also have tax holidays for inner-city investment and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe will empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.\u201d The president-elect\u2019s plan comes just as anti-Trump protesters have filled major urban areas in recent days, crowding the streets with some resulting in violence.\u00a0 According to election exit polls , the president-elect fared poorly among black voters, garnering just 8 percent of African-American support. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, in comparison, won 88 percent of the black vote. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

The letter about the email inquiry \u2014 sent from FBI Director James Comey to Congress 11 days before the vote \u2014 raised doubts that helped to stop the campaign's momentum at a critical time, Clinton said in a farewell conference call with donors. A source who was on the call, which was reported by The Washington Post and others, confirmed Clinton's remarks to NBC News. The source added that Clinton acknowledged that other factors contributed to her failed bid. But Comey's closure of the inquiry just two days before the election on Tuesday boosted undecided voters in Donald Trump's favor even further, Clinton reportedly said.

On Wednesday, the day after Trump's stunning upset, Clinton gave a gracious concession speech in which she urged Americans to give Trump \"a chance to lead\" and told women and girls to never give up on their dreams, even if they suffer setbacks. But she didn't delve into what she felt had led to her defeat. She also didn't mention the FBI inquiry during an appearance Friday night at her Brooklyn, New York, campaign headquarters where she thanked staffers . Comey's letter revealed that a newly discovered batch of emails had prompted him to take another look at the email investigation that had dogged the former secretary of state throughout her candidacy. For the following eight days, Americans waited as the FBI sifted through 450,000 emails \u2014 only for Comey to then announce that the bureau wouldn't reverse its initial decision from July that there was no evidence of criminality on Clinton's part. Related: Who Is James Comey? He's Dealt With Minefields Before While Comey has donated to past GOP presidential candidates and was a registered Republican until recently, Clinton did not mention his party affiliations on Saturday. Trump, for his part, latched onto his claims that the election was \"rigged\" after the speedy conclusion from the FBI that nothing in the new emails merited charges against Clinton. \"Right now, she is being protected by a rigged system. It's a totally rigged system,\" Trump had said, adding that it wasn't possible to review that many emails in such a short period of time. Computer experts \u2014 even former CIA employee Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information from the government \u2014 have said otherwise. Play ",

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) By John Wagner , Ed O'Keefe and Karen Tumulty November 12 at 5:06 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @edatpost Follow @ktumulty Amid the wreckage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss, Democrats have started jockeying for control of the national party \u2014 and vigorously debating a dramatic course correction in response to Donald Trump\u2019s election. The upcoming choice of a new Democratic National Committee chairman could become an early proxy fight between the establishment wing of the party, embodied by Clinton, and the party\u2019s more liberal members, many of them aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the party\u2019s runner-up in the Democratic primaries. Sanders and other liberal lawmakers and advocacy groups say the DNC needs to be reimagined as less of an insider\u2019s club focused on raising money and more of an advocate for the working-class voters won over Tuesday by the Republican president-elect. With Clinton\u2019s loss, the DNC chairman is certain to become a more visible face of the Democratic Party, and the contest to replace interim chairwoman Donna Brazile now appears to be a wide-open affair. Brazile stepped in for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who announced her resignation in July after the release of a trove of hacked emails that suggested that the DNC was aiding Clinton in preference to Sanders in the primaries. Had Clinton won Tuesday, she would have been expected to name a political ally to head the DNC. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) speaks during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News) [ A series of strategic mistakes likely sealed Clinton\u2019s fate ] The candidate garnering the most early attention is Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a favorite of liberal advocacy groups and a Muslim \u2014 a fact that his supporters argue would send a strong signal about the party\u2019s diversity during Trump\u2019s tenure. Support for Ellison has extended beyond his liberal base; already backed by Sanders, he won the endorsement Friday of Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is expected to be the next Senate minority leader. Ellison plans to announce his bid for the chairmanship Monday. Sanders said he thinks a DNC \u201cpreoccupied\u201d with raising large sums of money from wealthy donors was partly responsible for Tuesday\u2019s loss. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell working people you\u2019re on their side while at the same time you\u2019re raising money from Wall Street and the billionaire class,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe Democratic Party has to be focused on grass-roots America and not wealthy people attending cocktail parties.\u201d On a conference call Saturday between Clinton and her top donors, her finance director, Dennis Cheng, said Clinton\u2019s fundraising operation had raised $972\u00a0million for her campaign, the DNC and state parties. Of that amount, 56\u00a0percent was \u201cgenerated by the people on this call,\u201d Cheng said. Former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley participates in a Democratic presidential primary debate in Iowa in November 2015. (Charlie Neibergall/AP) In total, the campaign held more than 1,500 fundraisers, of which Clinton attended nearly 400 herself, and more than 3\u00a0million people made donations, Cheng said. Sanders acknowledged the need for the party to continue its function as a fundraising vehicle but suggested a model akin to his presidential campaign, which raised much of its money from small-dollar donors. \u201cMillions of people are willing to put in 20 bucks, 30 bucks, 50 bucks if there\u2019s a party to believe in,\u201d he said. His views have been echoed by several liberal groups that are supportive of Ellison. \u201cThe Democratic establishment had their chance with this election,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s time for new leadership of the Democratic Party \u2014 younger, more diverse and more ideological \u2014 that is hungry to do things differently, like leading a movement instead of dragging people to the polls.\u201d Those more closely aligned with Clinton are cautioning against overreacting to an election in which she appears to have won the popular vote. Among at least eight hopefuls for chairman who have emerged, still others are billing themselves as unifiers between Clinton and Sanders supporters. Those include former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, who said Friday that he is taking a \u201chard look\u201d at seeking the chairmanship. O\u2019Malley, who ended his presidential bid after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, said he thinks he was the second choice of many Sanders supporters and that many Clinton supporters have encouraged him to seek the DNC role. \u201cThat puts me in a unique position right now to bridge that divide,\u201d said O\u2019Malley, who previously headed the Democratic Governors Association. \u201cWe need to come together. We need to start acting like a party again.\u201d At least four of those hoping to become party chairman are Latino, a sign of that demographic\u2019s growing clout within the party. During a conference call Thursday with members of the liberal advocacy group Democracy for America, Ellison said the party needs to become more of a presence in local communities across the country. He argued that television advertising and sophisticated data analysis of voter behavior is no substitute \u201cfor getting Dems together around a pot of chili and getting to know them.\u201d Already, Ellison has come under fire from some Democrats who argue that their party needs a full-time chairman and that his continuing to serve in Congress would make that impossible. Former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who served as DNC chairman a decade ago, announced plans to try to regain the position and made the case for a full-time role. \u201cLook, I like Keith Ellison a lot,\u201d Dean said during a Friday appearance on MSNBC. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good guy. There\u2019s one problem: You cannot do this job and sit in a political office at the same time. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d That view was echoed Friday by longtime Democratic operative Harold Ickes: \u201cI do think there\u2019s a very strong argument for a full-time DNC chair, especially for a party out of power.\u201d Henry Mu\u00f1oz III, the DNC\u2019s national finance chairman who helped Clinton collect millions of dollars for her campaign, said Friday that he is considering a bid for party chairman but also is in touch with other Hispanic leaders about ensuring that the DNC more properly represents Latino concerns. \u201cThe one thing that is abundantly clear is that the Latino community held up their end of the bargain,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cWe did deliver on our promise.\u201d Hispanics accounted for at least 11\u00a0percent of all voters on Election Day, according to national exit polls \u2014 a one-percentage-point increase from the 2012 presidential election. Mu\u00f1oz said the participation of Latinos would have been even greater if the party had been more attuned to their concerns in the past four years. In addition to Mu\u00f1oz, outgoing Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) are said to be considering running for chairman. Mu\u00f1oz confirmed that he is in touch with all of them. On the basis of the wide interest, \u201cI expect our perspective will be presented up front in the talks about the DNC going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re a long way from making a pick,\u201d he added. Gallego, 36, a former U.S. Marine corporal who represents most of the Phoenix area, is popular with younger congressional Democrats and is seen as a rising figure in a new generation of Democratic leaders. Becerra, who was an avid campaigner for Clinton, is said to be considering the DNC job now that he will not have an opportunity to serve in a Clinton Cabinet, as he had expected. Another potential contender eyeing the race is Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Harrison said the next DNC chairman should focus far more on helping build the state Democratic parties, including his, across the country. \u201cThere\u2019s no party-building that\u2019s taking place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes in\u00adcred\u00adibly difficult to recruit candidates.\u201d Jason Kander, who lost the Senate race in Missouri to Roy Blunt (R) on Tuesday, also is considering a run for chairman, according to people close to him. Some longtime Democrats say the race has probably begun prematurely \u2014 particularly as the party is still mourning Clinton\u2019s loss. Former national chairman Don Fowler, a fixture in South Carolina, said, \u201cI think it\u2019s somewhat ill-advised for people to get in and try to do all of this during a funeral.\u201d Anne Gearan contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

(Photo: Shakil Adil, AP) QUETTA, Pakistan \u2014 A Pakistani official says the death toll from a bomb blast at a Sufi shrine in southwest Pakistan has risen to 45 and over 100 wounded. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the suicide attack Saturday at the shrine of Sufi saint Shah Bilal Noorani in Khuzdar district in the southwestern Baluchistan province. Abdur Rasool, an official at the province\u2019s home ministry, says rescuers transported over 100 wounded and 45 bodies to hospitals. The blast targeted worshippers as they were in the throes of their devotional \u201cdhamal\u201d dance. Islamic militants have previously targeted the province, which for over a decade has been the scene of a low-intensity insurgency by nationalist and separatist groups demanding a bigger share of regional resources.

By Gregory S. Schneider November 12 at 7:00 AM Follow @SchneiderG The sun sets over Coeburn, Va. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post) Behind the barber\u2019s chair where Claude Rasnake diagnoses many of the world\u2019s problems, he charted the to-do list of the Trump administration. Social Security, Medicare, the tax code \u2014 maybe Trump and a Republican Congress can finally get them fixed. Dismantle Obamacare and fix roads and bridges, too. But all that comes later, after the top priority. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019d like him to do is fire that lady that runs the EPA,\u201d Rasnake, 81, said, working the trimmer around a customer\u2019s ear. The Environmental Protection Agency makes regulations that limit the use of coal, and here that kills jobs. Rasnake had pondered his vote for months. He didn\u2019t like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton \u2014 didn\u2019t like the insults and the lies. But about a week ago he made up his mind, and it came down to this: Clinton had promised to put coal companies out of business and Trump donned a miner\u2019s helmet and said he would help the dying industry. [ McConnell says it\u2019s \u2018hard to tell\u2019 if President Trump will bring back coal jobs ] \u201cThat was the basis of our economy here,\u201d Rasnake said, as his customer began to grunt in agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s really hurt. I\u2019ve lost customers \u2014 some have had to move away. The one\u2019s that are left have a hard time getting by, month to month.\u201d Claude Rasnake, 81, sits in his barber shop in Lebanon, Va. Rasnake voted for Trump with hopes that he would bring jobs to the area. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post) This part of Virginia, the far Southwest, is almost as distant from Washington as Boston is. These are the red-state voters who went overwhelmingly for Trump but were canceled out by blue Northern Virginia. But while the Washington suburbs helped Clinton take Virginia\u2019s 13 electoral votes, the people of these hard-hit hamlets and towns woke up Wednesday to find that their man had actually won the presidency. \u201cI was elated. I was super surprised,\u201d said Roy Bonney, 49, who owns Red Oak Trading Co., a hardware and home improvement store in Coeburn. He had thought Trump shot his mouth off too much to get elected. Many voters here said the same, that they were unhappy with the way Trump talked and conducted himself. But they voted for him by a huge margin. Russell County, where Lebanon is located, went 78 percent for Trump, 19 percent for Clinton. Wise County, where Coeburn is located, was 80 percent Trump. Dickenson, Tazewell, Lee, Scott and Buchanan counties \u2014 coal country \u2014 were all the same. Many areas went more heavily for Trump than they did for Mitt Romney four years ago. Variety's window in Coeburn, Va., displays support for Trump. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post) Unemployment in these counties runs roughly twice the statewide rate of 4 percent. Most of the job losses are from mining and related industries. Virginia coal production last year dropped 70\u00a0percent from its peak, in 1990, and is declining every year. The growth jobs are in retail, food services, health care and social assistance, according to data from the Virginia Employment Commission. A lot of the work is part time. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of factories closing down. Families have lost jobs,\u201d said Linda Smith, 39, who works part time at the Food City grocery store in Lebanon and can\u2019t afford health insurance, even under the Affordable Care Act. Her husband, who once worked in mining, is disabled from a car accident. \u201cMen don\u2019t know how to do nothing at all except work in the coal mines. . . . If [Trump] can get some of that opened back up, people will be happy.\u201d In Wise County, Juan Lopez, 42, climbs down off the huge mining truck he\u2019s been repairing, hands blackened with grease. He came to the United States in 1991 from Mexico, got married, got his citizenship, had two children. \u201cWe go to church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do it right.\u201d Lopez voted for Trump. It was a vote to keep his job. \u201cThey say if Trump can do it better [with the coal industry], we might be able to have jobs two or three more years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if not, we might be out by the end of next year.\u201d Juan Lopez, 42, works at Double R Trucking in Coeburn, Va. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post) Ricky Meade, 47, owner of Double R Trucking, stands between his trucks in Coeburn, Va. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post) Lopez\u2019s employer, Ricky Meade, owns a vast fleet of trucks for hauling or loading coal \u2014 yellow and red Peterbilt and Kenworth rigs with 35-foot trailers, about 70 of them sitting idle behind a chain-link fence bearing Trump/Pence signs. \u201cWe went from running 85 trucks to running eight trucks, over the past three or four years,\u201d said Meade, 47. He grew up here, but now lives an hour\u2019s drive away in Bristol, Tenn., so his daughters can have more opportunities. His customer base is down to a single mine. From 105 employees, he now has about 25. He\u2019s had to hire a man to do nothing but start up trucks and move them around, so they can stay in working condition. The whole area, he said, is literally built on coal. All the commercial buildings are on sites that had been leveled by mining. All the jobs are connected. \u201cEverything you see, everything we got came in some way from coal. If it wasn\u2019t for coal this part of Virginia wouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Trucks are parked at Double R Trucking in Coeburn, Va. The trucking company has seen a loss of business because of a decline in coal production. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post) Meade stayed up long past midnight Tuesday, watching election returns. Then he couldn\u2019t sleep and turned them on again. He never thought Trump would win, and didn\u2019t much like him. \u201cHe was the lesser of two evils, but he was our only hope,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Hillary I don\u2019t know that we would survive.\u201d Now he wants to see if Trump will deliver on what he promised. If he lowers restrictions on power plants, then use of steam coal may go up and some miners may go back to work. \u201cI know he can\u2019t wave a magic wand. I know we can\u2019t get back to where we were two or three years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope we can get back at least part of it.\u201d That alone is a tall order. Coal is simply on the wane worldwide as climate change becomes more of a concern, natural gas remains cheap and alternate forms of energy become more cost-effective. U.S. coal consumption dropped 13 percent last year. Back at Rasnake\u2019s barber shop, where he keeps his guitar in a chair because \u201ca lotta barbers play music, especially up here in these mountains,\u201d hope is barely hanging on. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have any jobs here it\u2019s going to have to be the coal companies. This little town is just drying up,\u201d said Kenneth Jessee, 67, who retired from a coal company three years ago to farm. As Rasnake talked about his decision to vote for Trump, the man getting a haircut finally spoke up at the question of whether Trump can make a difference. \u201cNo, he can\u2019t,\u201d said William Sisk, 78, of Buchanan County. \u201cYou won\u2019t see those people working in the coal industry no more. Natural gas is too cheap. Any kind of market for coal anymore is very weak.\u201d Empty train cars sit on the tracks near Dante, Va. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post) \"Laid Off?\" reads a sign outside Dominion's Hybrid Energy Center in Virginia City, Va. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post) Sisk spent 30 years at Pittston Coal, he said, as Rasnake finished and whipped the cover off him. \u201cI made a good living at it, got a good retirement. But it\u2019s gone,\u201d he said, referring to the industry, but also Pittston, which sold out years ago after a crippling strike. \u201cIt was the life\u2019s blood here,\u201d Rasnake agreed. \u201cA lot of people talk about [President] Obama\u2019s war on coal,\u201d Sisk said, standing and getting his cap. \u201cBut the coal war was on long before Obama got there. The bottom dropped plum out when he got in there and he got all the blame for it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to come back.\u201d As Sisk stepped out into the sunlight, he confessed that he didn\u2019t vote for Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s too radical. He promised too much,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can promise anything, but you got to deliver.\u201d Sisk didn\u2019t vote at all. local ",

Trump will be appointing a chief of staff \u201csoon,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager and now a senior adviser to the presidential transition team, told reporters Saturday as she arrived at Trump Tower. And he\u2019ll soon be making his next public appearance \u201cin the next couple of days,\u201d according to press pool reports. When asked by reporters what the timetable was on Trump announcing his chief of staff, Conway said it was \u201cimminent.\u201d \u201cI think chairman Priebus has expressed an interest in the position,\u201d she added, referring to Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus. \u201cThere are several people being considered. And it\u2019s Mr. Trump\u2019s decision ultimately.\u201d Conway herself is discussing with Trump her own possible position in the administration. Questioned when Trump would be making his first public appearance since his election night victory speech, Conway added: \u201cIn the next couple of days actually. We\u2019re talking about that.\u201d On whether Trump would be making a victory tour to certain states, the Trump campaign manager said, \u201cit\u2019s possible. We\u2019re working on the schedule.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump also met with Nigel Farage, the British politician who spearheaded the successful Brexit campaign for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Farage has also appeared with Trump on the campaign trail. Conway called the meeting \u201cvery productive.\u201d \u201cI think they enjoy each other\u2019s company and they absolutely had an opportunity to talk about freedom and winning and what this all means for the world,\u201d she said. Another big name that called on Trump Saturday -- to little avail -- was Michael Moore, the progressive documentary filmmaker. Moore, who arrived at Trump Tower as protesters rallied outside, has been a vocal critic of the president-elect and he continued Saturday with his condemnation. Trump, Moore told reporters, was an \u201cillegitimate president and [he] does not have the vote of the people\u201d because of the popular vote, which CBS projects Clinton is winning. Moore, who was livestreaming his unscheduled visit, was eventually stopped by security on the fourth floor of Trump Tower. \u201cYou\u2019d have a to check with his staff,\u201d Moore was told by a Secret Service agent. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Caption A look at Hillary Clinton\u2019s final 24 hours on the campaign trail. \u00a0Nov. 7, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton takes a picture with the traveling press group before boarding her campaign plane in White Plains, N.Y., before Election Day. Melina Mara/The Washington Post By Anne Gearan November 12 at 11:51 AM Follow @agearan WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. \u2014 Hillary Clinton looked very happy as she closed her hectic final day of campaigning here in the wee hours of Tuesday to the shouts and cheers of an excited hometown band of supporters, neighbors and staff. \u201cI believe that she will win,\u201d the crowd chanted as Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, shook hands on an airport tarmac in bitter cold. Clinton did, too \u2014 as her relaxed, confident posture throughout her final day on the trail Monday had revealed. She grinned as she and President Obama clasped hands. She smiled softly as her husband slung his arm around her on the campaign plane, before the champagne was popped. She danced and clapped as Bruce Springsteen sang at one rally and Lady Gaga at another. Yet for all the trappings of a winning campaign in view that day, atop all the polling and predictions favoring Clinton, there were signs of trouble in those final hours. She campaigned in Pennsylvania twice on that last day, adding a morning rally in Pittsburgh to a long-planned evening showstopper in Philadelphia alongside Obama and first lady Michelle Obama. In a crucial Democratic stronghold, Trump surged. Clinton didn\u2019;t. View Graphic In a crucial Democratic stronghold, Trump surged. Clinton didn\u2019;t. That was a testament to the crucial importance of Pennsylvania, the biggest prize among the states in the Northeast and industrial Midwest where Republican Donald Trump had closed in the polls as Election Day approached. She ended up losing Pennsylvania and both of the other states she visited on the final day \u2014 Michigan and North Carolina. All were states where she had held seemingly durable leads two or three weeks before. The campaign appeared confident headed into the last week, despite the shifting ground; the last day\u2019s schedule was designed with feel-good events to juice up turnout. Although that rally at Independence Mall in Philadelphia was originally intended to close out the evening, the campaign at the last minute added a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. And Clinton found herself being asked by aides to do quickie radio interviews with black radio shows such as the \u201cRise and Grind Morning Show\u201d on WUSL in Philadelphia, with hosts Mina Saywhat, Mikey Dredd and Muthaknows. At the outdoor get-out-the-vote rally in Pittsburgh on that sparkling fall afternoon, Clinton framed the election as a referendum on the future and the character of America. Much of the contest had been about the character of both Clinton and her opponent. Clinton\u2019s attacks on Trump as unfit for the presidency, usually made by turning his own words against him, had largely supplanted regular acknowledgment of the economic and political anxieties that many Americans were feeling. That was true on the eve of the election, too. The campaign knew that voters were turning away in disgust. But her attempt to reframe a relentlessly negative contest in optimistic terms was still, ultimately, about Trump \u2014 and it fell short. How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea View Graphic How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea \u201cOur core values are being tested in this election, and I know that people are frustrated. A lot of people feel left out and left behind. There\u2019s fear, even anger in our country,\u201d she said. From the back of the crowd then came a shouted protest that sounded like \u201cVote Trump!\u201d Clinton kept talking. \u201cBut I\u2019ve gotta say, anger is not a plan, my friends.\u201d Next up was Grand Rapids, Mich., a majority-white city where the target audience was largely moderate women. Obama was dispatched on an emergency mission to rally young people in Ann Arbor, Mich. Clinton aides originally hoped to send Obama to Detroit to rally black voters, but they decided against it for fear of disrupting a police funeral that day. Clinton had spent little time in Michigan until the final week, when Trump had nearly tied her there. And the rescue mission came too late. In the end, although Clinton won Detroit\u2019s Wayne County in a landslide, she underperformed Obama there by 78,000 votes \u2014 vastly more than her statewide losing margin of roughly 11,000. \u201cWe are already great, but we can be greater, and we will be greater,\u201d Clinton said in Grand Rapids. \u201cI love our country. I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we cannot do when we make up our minds,\u201d she said. Trump was also in Grand Rapids on his final campaign day, reflecting the momentum he claimed \u2014 rightly \u2014 was swinging his way in states that had voted for Democrats for president for a generation. \u201cWe\u2019re hours away from a once-in-a-lifetime change,\u201d Trump said then. The emotional heart of Clinton\u2019s last day was a stunning tableau of Americana laid out before Independence Hall in Philadelphia on a crisp, clear evening. A giddy crowd of 33,000 sang along as Springsteen opened with \u201cThunder Road.\u201d He also played \u201cLong Walk Home,\u201d an elegy for hollowed-out small-town America, the kinds of places that used to always vote Democratic. Obama and Michelle Obama, whom the Clinton campaign considered their best weapon against Trump among women and young black voters, both delivered rousing tributes to Clinton. Bill Clinton kept his fond remarks short. It was clearly designed as the capstone to the long campaign, a celebration meant to urge Pennsylvania voters out to the polls the next morning with a smile. So it was somewhat jarring when the campaign added a hastily arranged midnight rally in Raleigh to the schedule. The slapdash affair in a gymnasium at North Carolina State University was a happy occasion. Lady Gaga\u2019s acoustic performance was luminous, Clinton shimmied on stage and the screaming crowd was ecstatic. Trouble might have been in the air, though. Clinton badly needed black voters in North Carolina, and the crowd was overwhelmingly white. When Chelsea Clinton asked how many had already voted early, nearly everyone enthusiastically raised a hand \u2014 meaning few in the crowd were left to energize. The event itself was held too late \u2014 it was after 1 a.m. when Clinton spoke \u2014 to get much media attention. \u201cI just can\u2019t wait to raise both my hands with all of you in a few hours,\u201d Chelsea Clinton said, grinning. It had been her job during the campaign to speak before college audiences on her mother\u2019s behalf. \u201cI think I\u2019m the most excited person in my family, but my dad may be just as excited,\u201d she said. \u201cI am fiercely, fiercely, fiercely proud to be my mother\u2019s daughter, and I\u2019m also really proud to be my father\u2019s daughter.\u201d Her parents beamed. Finally, on the last flight aboard her blue and white \u201cStronger Together\u201d campaign plane from Raleigh home to the small airport here near her home in Chappaqua, Clinton mingled and laughed with staffers in full view of reporters. As reporters called out to Bill Clinton, urging him to come to the separate press cabin to talk, he jokingly cupped a hand to his ear, pretending not to hear. Hillary Clinton smiled happily and leaned into his shoulder. They were having a lovely time, at ease in the expectation that while the election would be close, she would win. Champagne was poured for all, to celebrate the final flight and the end of the campaign. On the spur of the moment, Clinton, her husband and a group of staffers filmed a \u201cmannequin challenge\u201d video on board. The videos of people in still-life poses are an Internet sensation, and Clinton gamely joined in alongside rock singer Jon Bon Jovi, who had hitched a ride on the plane after performing in Raleigh. \u201cDon\u2019t stand still. Go vote today,\u201d the campaign video urged. For Clinton, not enough people did. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos makes a peace sign with wife Maria Clemencia Rodriguez after voting in the October referendum. That deal was rejected by voters; both sides hope the new, amended version will find success. Mario Tama/Getty Images For the second time in just six weeks, it appears that Latin America's longest-running war may finally end in peace. The Colombian government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, announced an agreement Saturday night that would end their 52-year guerrilla war \u2014 another attempt at peace after Colombian voters narrowly rejected a previous deal in an October referendum. \"We have reached a new final accord to end the armed conflict that integrates changes, precisions and proposals suggested by the most diverse sectors of society,\" both groups announced in a statement. Colombia's Rebels Are Eager To Become Civilians In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry congratulated the country and its leaders on the new deal. \"After 52 years of war, no peace agreement can satisfy everyone in every detail,\" Kerry said in the statement. \"But this agreement constitutes an important step forward on Colombia's path to a just and durable peace. The United States, in coordination with the Government of Colombia, will continue to support full implementation of the final peace agreement.\" The war between the FARC and the Colombian government began in the 1960s; since then, it has been responsible for the deaths of more than 200,000 people and the displacement of millions more. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has made peace with the rebel group a centerpiece of his time in office. He began talks with the FARC in 2012, and his government has pursued intense peace negotiations in Havana in the years that followed, reaching a tentative outline for a deal last year and final terms for it in August . Though voters rejected the first attempt in a nationwide referendum \u2014 by a margin of less than 1 percent \u2014 Santos was rewarded for his efforts with a Nobel Peace Prize last month. Article continues after sponsorship Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos Awarded Nobel Peace Prize \"I won't give up,\" Santos declared shortly after the rejection he was dealt in the referendum. \"I'll continue search for peace until the last moment of my mandate.\" Many Colombians objected to the first peace agreement for its perceived leniency toward FARC fighters. That deal, which would have allowed rebels to avoid being prosecuted for war crimes, placed an emphasis on reconciliation that drew criticism from many voters. As John Otis reported at the time : \"People want to see these FARC guerrillas in prison stripes behind bars.\" Reuters reports that it remains unclear whether the agreement announced Saturday will again be voted on in a referendum.

Iraqi troops inched ahead in their battle to retake the northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State group on Friday, as the U.N. revealed fresh evidence that the extremists have used chemical weapons. (AP Photo/Marko Drobnjakovic) 0 Shares Email A suicide car bomber from the Islamic State group attacked Iraqi special forces in Mosul on Saturday, setting off heavy fighting in the northern city. The early morning attack in the Qadisiya neighborhood, which the troops entered a day earlier, was followed by a barrage of gunfire, mortar rounds and rocket-propelled grenades, Iraqi officers said. Fighting was also underway in the adjoining Arbajiya neighborhood, the officers added, speaking on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to brief reporters. The Iraqi armed forces do not release casualty figures, but field medics have noted dozens of killed and wounded since the operation to liberate Iraq's second largest city began on Oct. 17. Iraqi special forces entered Mosul earlier this month, gaining a foothold on the city's eastern edges. But the advance has slowed as they push into more densely populated neighborhoods. The urban landscape inside Mosul proper makes defense easier for the militants, eager to hold on to the last major Iraqi stronghold of their self-styled caliphate. Defeat in Mosul would be a major blow to their project, and they have said they are ready to fight to the death. To the south of the city, militarized Iraqi police have come within 3 miles (5 kilometers) of Mosul's airport, which satellite images show has been heavily fortified. The images, taken earlier this month by U.S.-based private intelligence firm Stratfor , show IS fighters have cleared terrain and leveled buildings around the airport and a nearby former military base on the west bank of the Tigris River. Rows of concrete barricades, earthen mounds and rubble are blocking other key routes into the city center. In Baghdad , meanwhile, bombings killed at least nine people and wounded 32 others, according to police and medical officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. The deadliest of the attacks hit the Kifah neighborhood in the city center, ripping through an area full of auto repair shops, killing three and wounding 10. The capital has seen near-daily bombings since the Mosul operation began, but no large-scale attacks. Militants frequently target security forces and the Shiite majority as part of its campaign to destabilize the country. 0 Shares ",

But if they do, Pizer added, \"It will not be because they were unconstitutional. It will be because the new administration disagrees.\" Regardless of whether Trump tries to reconfigure the federal policies on transgender equality, there will always be legal recourse to challenge the new policies. \"Keep in mind that much of the Obama Administration's activity was interpretation and enforcement of federal statutes based on court decisions,\" Pizer told NBC OUT. \"Those decisions will remain in place whether the new administration changes those regulations and 'guidance' or not.\" Repeal of Affordable Care Act In his 100-day plan, Trump states he will \"repeal and replace Obamacare.\" He plans to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Obama's signature piece of legislation, with \"Health Savings Accounts\" and \"the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\" This particular provision is poised to impact millions of Americans, not just the LGBTQ community. But for LGBTQ people specifically, the repeal of the ACA, or Obamacare as it's often called, has caused fear around coverage for gender-reaffirming care, spending caps on coverage for HIV-related treatment and the impact on Medicaid and Medicare for low-income segments of the community. \"They can do it, and they intend to do it,\" HRC Government Affairs Director David Stacy said in the Facebook Live discussion. \"But if you're in an ACA health care plan right now on the exchange, or you're in a Medicaid program, you're not going to have your health care cut off in the immediate term. If they are successful in repealing it, there's going to be some sort of transition period.\" RELATED: Shocked and Disappointed, LGBTQ Activists Vow to Fight On If and when Trump does repeal the ACA, the harshest impact will be felt on LGBTQ people with lower incomes as well as those with pre-existing conditions. \"Repeal of this law very likely means a return to the bad old days of pre-existing condition exclusions from health insurance and denials of insurance outright,\" Pizer of Lambda Legal said. \"Repeal also very likely would mean an end to the important federal subsidies for people of limited means. Leaving Medicaid to states likely would mean a dramatic change in that program and deeply problematic decreases in care for those who are most vulnerable.\" And as one HIV-positive man told NBC OUT on Wednesday at an anti-Trump protest in New York, losing the ACA could mean a return to insurance spending caps\u2014a dangerous prospect for people living with the virus or people living with chronic conditions that result in high health-care costs. \"If they roll back the spending caps, I can never have a lapse in employment. My pills cost over $3,000 a month,\" Christen Madsen II said, while standing outside Trump Tower. \"And they used to be able to put a cap on the amount insurance would cover for prescriptions, so that could come back.\" Other Concerns Aside from concerns about what's specifically in Trump's \"Contract With the American Voter,\" LGBTQ Americans have a long list of other concerns about what a Trump presidency will mean for them\u2014and the rights they've gained under President Obama. During Thursday's Facebook Live chat, the HRC team addressed a number questions related to military service, \"religious freedom\" bills, hate crime protections and other topics related to anti-LGBTQ discrimination. Military Service David Stacy, of HRC, said the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\" is \"exceedingly unlikely.\" \"One of the reasons is, openly LGB service in the military has been phenomenally successful \u2026 The military leadership of our country feels good about it,\" he explained. \"Transgender military service has just begun, and I think that is a little more at risk \u2026 But once the military starts to implement something, it takes a lot of energy to change course,\" Stacy added. Hate Crimes As for criminal justice, HRC's Warbelow said it is unlikely Trump and Pence would overturn the Hate Crimes Prevention Act , but she did add the new Department of Justice leadership may not pursue hate crime investigations as fiercely as the Obama administration has. Discrimination Vice President-elect Mike Pence told evangelical radio host Dr. James Dobson on Wednesday that \"The Trump-Pence administration will be dedicated to preserving \u2026 the freedom of religion that's enshrined in our Bill of Rights.\" Pence issued the phrase in response to questions about whether his administration would work to make sure religious businesses don't have to cover birth control for employees, but critics note \"religious freedom\" bills can result in discrimination against LGBTQ people . As far as legal protection from discrimination, HRC's Warbelow reminded Facebook Live viewers that there's still no federal anti-discrimination clause protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination in public facilities. But many states and cities do have anti-discrimination laws in place that specify sexual orientation and gender identity\u2014those will most likely not be affected by the new administration. RELATED: Anti-Trump Protesters Fear Rollback of LGBTQ Rights However, existing routes for gaining recourse when employment and housing discrimination occur may be altered. \"What will likely happen with this new administration is that they will not enforce those laws in the same way as President Obama's administration,\" Warbelow explained. \"The Department of Justice, the EEOC, the Department of Labor will not as robustly enforce and they will unfortunately turn their back on the LGBT community\u2014but people still can have legal recourse and file those complaints.\" Parenthood During Thursday's Facebook Live conversation, the HRC staff suggested same-sex parents make sure that adoption papers and birth certificates for their children are intact with names of both parents, just to be cautious. Going Forward While lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans wait for more of President-elect Trump's policy plans to be revealed, the hope is that he will make good on his victory speech promise to be \"president for all Americans\"\u2014including LGBTQ Americans.

California voters decided to get rid of them Plastic bag ban Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times Pablo DeLaTorre, his wife, Maria Ruiz, and their two sons walk out of the Superior Grocers supermarket in Compton with a full cart of groceries. Pablo DeLaTorre, his wife, Maria Ruiz, and their two sons walk out of the Superior Grocers supermarket in Compton with a full cart of groceries. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Samantha Masunaga and Ronald D. White Contact Reporters As a caregiver, Sadie Hodge frequently buys groceries for her elderly and immobile patients. But\u00a0Friday morning, Hodge got a surprise at\u00a0the checkout line at a Compton Food 4 Less\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a 10-cent-per-bag fee that went into effect\u00a0after voters narrowly approved the nation\u2019s first statewide ban on single-use plastic bags at most grocery\u00a0stores. She had \u201cno words\u201d for her annoyance. \u201cI was just in this store a couple of days ago and today I'm back and I had to buy bags,\u201d said Hodge, who sees those dimes adding up to dollars of extra cost.\u00a0\u201cI was used to the convenience of not having to think about this, and that has just stopped.\u201d After a\u00a0referendum upholding the ban on single-use plastic carryout bags passed with 52% of the vote\u00a0Tuesday, millions of California shoppers like Hodge no longer have the option of getting single-use plastic bags at most grocery, convenience and liquor stores, as well as large pharmacies. Customers will either have to bring their own\u00a0bags\u00a0or buy a recycled paper bag or sturdier reusable plastic bag at the store for at least 10 cents. Environmental groups say the ban will help stem pollution and prevent sea animals from eating or getting entangled in the flimsy plastic that drifts into waterways. Every year, about 15 billion single-use plastic bags are given out to California consumers,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. \u201cIt\u2019s a victory for all of California, from inland neighborhoods and communities to marine animals off our coast,\u201d said Nick Colin, marketing and communications manager for Heal the Bay, which has been campaigning for local single-use plastic bag bans for more than eight years. The California Grocers Assn. trade group also backed the measure, which drew a total of $2 million in donations for its campaign. But plastic bag makers, which have a presence in Los Angeles, have argued a ban on single-use plastic bags would diminish local manufacturing jobs and that money collected from the bag fees wasn\u2019t going toward environmental causes. Elkay Plastics, a packaging distributor based in Los Angeles, called the restrictions \u201cmisguided,\u201d even though single-use plastic bags make up only a \u201ccouple percent\u201d of the company\u2019s total business. \u201cWe oppose the ban and believe that there are better alternatives available, such as recycling,\u201d \u00a0Bill Lindamood, Elkay Plastics\u2019 marketing director, wrote in an email. The proposition enacts a statewide ban on single-use plastic\u00a0bags that was initially passed by the California Legislature and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2014. Shortly after the ban was passed, the American Progressive Bag Alliance trade group qualified a referendum \u2014\u00a0Proposition 67 \u2014 to repeal the measure, which had not yet gone into effect. Lee Califf, executive director of the trade group,\u00a0has called the bill a \u201cbackroom deal between the California Grocers Assn. and their union friends to scam consumers out of billions of dollars in bag fees \u2014 all under the guise of environmentalism.\u201d For many Californians, the new statewide ban comes much later than bag bans in their local cities and counties. As of June, about 150 cities and counties across the state\u00a0already passed their own carryout bag laws, including Los Angeles, according to the\u00a0Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. Some customers welcomed the new ban.\u00a0 As Pablo DeLaTorre\u00a0stood in line at the Superior Grocers supermarket on East Compton Boulevard with his wife, two sons and a full cart of groceries, he\u00a0said he was in favor of the law, even though he uses a lot of plastic bags. He said he plans to bring his own bags to the grocery store from now on. \u201cWe will be helping the environment,\u201d said DeLaTorre, who works for the Los Angeles Harbor Department at Ports O\u2019Call. \u201cLike I tell my kids, we have to be aware of the impact these plastic bags have had in the oceans and other places.\u201d One bag manufacturer even decided to get ahead of the proposition. In 2013, Vernon-based Command Packaging\u00a0opened a 125,000-square-foot recycling facility in Salinas, Calif., that turns agricultural plastics into resin. That resin is then used to make reusable plastic grocery bags produced at the company\u2019s Southern California plant. It can\u00a0also be\u00a0used in reusable plastic bags that are used in the retail and restaurant industries. Grocery bags\u00a0make up about 10% to 15% of the company\u2019s business, but that is expected to increase to 25% because of the law,\u00a0said Cherish Changala, director of marketing at Command Packaging. \u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t just be making bags and thinking that would be OK\u00a0long-term,\u201d she said. \u201cWe needed to figure out a way to be sustainable.\u201d Money opposing the referendum poured in from bag makers in other states that wanted to prevent California adopting a landmark law that could spread across the nation. Hawaii has had a de facto ban on single-use plastic bags since 2015, as all of its most populous counties prohibit non-biodegradable plastic bags. But Oahu\u2019s law\u00a0has been criticized for allowing compostable single-use bags.\u00a0 Four out-of-state plastics manufacturers gave 97% of the contributions to the American Progressive Bag Alliance campaign against California\u2019s law,\u00a0 according to Maplight , a nonpartisan research organization that looks at money in politics. Major contributions included $2.8 million from South Carolina-based plastic bag manufacturer Hilex Poly and $1.1 million from Texas bag maker Formosa Plastics. In total, opponents raised about $6 million, according to the California secretary of state website . Indeed, by passing this referendum, California is setting an example for other states and cities that might be looking\u00a0to deal with litter and other environmental concerns,\u00a0said\u00a0Robert Kleinhenz, executive director of research at Beacon Economics. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u00a0shows up across the country in places that are heavily populated,\u201d he said. Shopper Ida Prince hoped the ban would lead to a cleaner neighborhood. \u201cPeople just throw the bags on the ground when they were done with them,\u201d she said\u00a0as she accompanied her daughter on a trip to Food 4 Less in Compton. '\u201dSo\u00a0I don't mind this at all. I think it is a good thing.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges \u00a0 \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss ",

The fired University of Cincinnati police officer said he feared for his life when Sam DuBose, 43, tried to drive away after being stopped for a missing front license plate on July 19, 2015. Prosecutors wanted jurors to conclude 26-year-old Ray Tensing \u201cpurposely\u201d killed DuBose. 43-year-old motorist Samuel DuBose shot and killed by Officer Ray Tensing in Cincinnati CBS The jury was handed the case around noon on Wednesday. Hamilton County Judge Megan Shanahan said jurors requested to review testimony by experts on police use of deadly force.\u00a0 On Friday, the jury told Shanahan they couldn\u2019t reach a decision on murder or voluntary manslaughter charges for Tensing. Shanahan said they had enough evidence for a decision and advised them to keep working. On Saturday morning, Shanahan declared a mistrial because the jury could not reach a unanimous decision after around 25 hours of deliberating. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said the jury was tilting toward a voluntary manslaughter conviction and an acquittal on the murder charge but ultimately couldn\u2019t agree. He said he\u2019ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the case again. Ray Tensing re-enters Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Megan Shanahan\u2019s courtroom after a short break in the jury selection process for his murder trial in Cincinnati Oct. 25, 2016. Carrie Cochran/The Cincinnati Enquirer via AP Authorities, downtown businesses and schools have been monitoring developments closely. Some businesses released employees early Thursday and at least two schools closed in anticipation of a verdict that could bring strong reactions. Police and emergency response agencies activated their regional operations center to monitor and share information about any violence. Before the trial began, city officials met with civil rights and faith leaders. The city was hit by riots in 2001 after a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black youth. This case has attracted demonstrators, including Black Lives Matter activists, outside the Hamilton County courthouse and is among other shootings across the country that have raised debate about how police treat black people.\u00a0 The prosecution said evidence including Tensing\u2019s own body camera video contradicted his story of being dragged by DuBose\u2019s car. \u201cThe video is the ultimate witness ... this video exposes Tensing\u2019s lies,\u201d Deters said during closing arguments. He said Tensing and his lawyer became \u201calmost comical with their word games,\u201d calling shooting DuBose \u201cstopping the threat\u201d and saying he \u201cperceived to be dragged.\u201d But defense attorney Stewart Mathews insisted Tensing was trying to keep from being run over. \u201cHe was in sheer terror,\u201d Mathews told jurors. \u201cThe evidence is very clear that a car can be just as deadly as a gun or knife.\u201d The shirt Ray Tensing was wearing at the time he fatally shot Sam DuBose is submitted as evidence, Friday, Nov. 4, 2016, in Cincinnati.\u00a0 AP He said prosecutors tried to use race as \u201ca smokescreen.\u201d They pointed to Tensing\u2019s T-shirt worn under his uniform that day. The \u201cGreat Smoky Mountains\u201d shirt had a Confederate flag on it. Mathews said it had \u201cno evidentiary value.\u201d Deters told jurors Wednesday that \u201cemotions are high,\u201d but they must decide based on the facts. Tensing wept on the stand Tuesday. He said his arm was stuck in DuBose\u2019s car at the time and the car was turning toward him. Deters asked Tensing about an outside report that eight out of every 10 drivers that Tensing pulled over for traffic stops were black, the highest rate of any University of Cincinnati officer. Tensing said he was often unaware of a driver\u2019s race, did not single people out unfairly and wasn\u2019t racist. Witnesses testified that DuBose had significant amounts of marijuana and cash on him, which Mathews described as a reason why he was desperate to flee. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Southerners Wearing Masks as Smoke Streams From Mountains By jeff martin and martha waggoner, associated press ATLANTA \u0097 Nov 12, 2016, 6:54 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press People take photos of a wildfire burning near Lake Lure, N.C., Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016. A state of emergency is in effect for 25 western North Carolina counties where active wildfires are burning, caused by the drought that began last spring. Gov. Pat McCrory said in a news release Thursday that he was declaring the state of emergency for one-quarter of North Carolina's 100 counties. (Patrick Sullivan/The Times-News via AP) 0 Shares Email Wildfires near the Georgia-North Carolina line are spewing smoke so thick that residents are being urged to wear special masks if they must do outdoor activities. The fires \u2014 many of them suspected arsons \u2014 have prompted evacuations in Georgia , North Carolina and Tennessee in recent days. The largest of dozens of ongoing wildfires in the South has now burned 13,300 acres, more than a third of the vast Cohutta Wilderness area, in the north Georgia mountains just south of the Tennessee line. Fire managers said Saturday that the blaze, believed to have ignited from a lightning strike in mid-October, was only 20 percent contained. In Macon County, North Carolina, special health masks were being made available Saturday. Emergency Management Director Warren Cabe said they're distributing N95-rated masks as regular surgical masks don't provide adequate protection from smoke particles. And yet, the drifting smoke that prompted air quality authorities to declare a Code Orange on Friday in Charlotte, North Carolina, cleared enough for Saturday's Charlotte Marathon to be run as planned under crisp blue skies. Kristen Butterfield, who works at a local shop in Chimney Rock, North Carolina told the Asheville Citizen-Times ( http://avlne.ws/2g6dfjf ) that around noon Friday authorities began ordering people to evacuate. Then she saw a structure catch fire. \"We had to get out,\" she said. \"They told us at noon and we were out by 2 p.m. at the latest. We took everything we could.\" Her friend Andre Whilden, who lives behind Chimney Rock village, said she and her husband hardly got any notice. \"We got everything packed that we could,\" she said, which included seven animals. Whilden said on Wednesday she saw one firetruck after another speed past her house and she knew the fire was getting worse. \"I didn't expect to be evacuated,\" she said. \"I expected it to stay up on the mountain, but on Wednesday I knew something wasn't right so I went down to the visitor's center, looked to my left and the whole mountain was on fire.\" Smoke has settled over Clayton, Georgia and surrounding Rabun County, where fires including a 2,000-acre blaze has forced people from their homes. That fire is a suspected arson blaze, and the sheriff has asked residents to be on the lookout for a dark blue SUV seen in the area where the fire started on Wednesday. In Tennessee, 42 of the 58 active wildfires in the state are suspected arsons \u2014 or about 72 percent of them \u2014 the Tennessee Department of Agriculture reported Saturday in its wildfire situation update. In North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, more than 20 wildfires have burned more than 17,000 acres and all of them are \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" federal forestry officials have said. The federal government has approved a request for money to fight the blazes in western North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory said. A grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will now pay 75 percent of the emergency protective measures taken in fighting the fires, McCrory said in a news release Saturday. In South Carolina, the Easley Fire Department is asking residents to donate water, Gatorade and other drinks to help firefighters battling a wildfire on Pinnacle Mountain. 0 Shares ",

If we slap 40 percent tariffs on them, we'll pay more,\" said Burtless. \"If we have a smaller number of immigrants, that will also boost the prices of goods and services that U.S. consumers buy,\" by making it harder to supply cheap labor, he told NBC News. But in Trump country, the mood is jubilant. Galvanized steelworkers Bailey didn't vote for the President-elect's social rhetoric, as \"some things you think but don't say,\" but rather the manufacturing boost. He hopes Trump will stop \"gangster\" Chinese from dumping cheap poor quality steel on the market, cut his taxes, and repeal Obamacare; but he also acknowledged the challenges Trump faces in enacting his vision. \"Mr. Trump will have to deliver on his promises,\" said Bailey. \"If he doesn't, he's going to be remembered as a dumpster fire.\" Hopeful farmers On his way to pick strawberries and castrate some pigs, Brandon Whitt, 37, said he hoped Trump will help him hand down his Tennessee family farm to the ninth generation. Brandon Whitt with Mary, his 2nd eldest of four children. He hopes Trump will open up more opportunities for farmers like himself. Courtesy of Brandon Whitt \"We need those American-made products,\" he said. He's hoping for relief on the death tax and a curbing of EPA regulations so that his 2,400-acre farm can afford to keep raising hogs and growing soybeans, wheat, and small grains he sells locally and on the global market. But Whitt didn't vote for Trump. Refusing to choose between the \"lesser of two evils\" he \"voted with his heart\" and wrote in John Kasich. Still he said he is \"extremely pleased\" with the final election results. \"I saw a rural America, blue-collar, hat-wearing Americans that get out and work with their hands that stood up and expressed themselves,\" said Whitt. \"We gathered in churches and communities all across the countryside and we voted for what we thought provided a better opportunity for our families and our country as a whole.\" He hopes for more available and affordable loans for farmers, competitive trade deals, and closer ties between the urban and agricultural worlds. \"I walked into an 8th grade job fair last Friday and one of the first questions I got was from a girl who asked why I didn't wear overalls,\" said Whitt. \"There's a huge disconnect.\" Disappointed mothers Bridging the gap between farmers and cities isn't as much a priority for Kimberly Coerr, a 47-year-old single mother and marketing professional from Maclean, Virginia. She said she's worried about her 401(k), and for her three boys, ages 11, 12 and 16. Single mother Kimberly Coerr said she's less worried about kitchen table issue and more about about explaining Trump's behavior to her kids who think he's \"funny.\" Courtesy of Kimberly Coerr \"I do worry he's going to be a destabilizing factor for the economy,\" she said of Trump. \"That means working longer than I would want to for my retirement age, or not being as secure.\" While she won't turn down a tax cut, she says she knows that tax cuts generally benefit the wealthy and powerful. And she's not excited about the talk of deregulating the banks or rolling back consumer protections. Trump has promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank act put into place after the 2008 financial crisis. The act prohibits commercial banks from making investments bets with their own deposits, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and other regulatory reform to prevent banks from imploding so destructively. \"Released from restrictions they can put us in another case where banks can run rampant and fail and hurt us all over again,\" said Coerr.

An encampment of homeless people along 6th Street on skid row this week. (Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times) Doug Smith Nine months after the Los Angeles City Council unanimously adopted a comprehensive plan to end homelessness, the first progress report on the plan, released this week, offered a sobering picture of the long and difficult path ahead. Proposals for storage lockers and toilets for street dwellers\u00a0are stalled, new shelter capacity is being added at a trickle, and the city bureaucracy moving more slowly than some council members had expected. \u201cI don\u2019t get that. There\u2019s so much red tape and process in that,\u00a0\u201d Councilman Michael\u00a0Bonin said of an item in the report citing a study of shared housing.\u00a0 \u201cIf there are beds available today, I would like us to be moving on it.\u201d The news wasn\u2019t all bad. Voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly\u00a0approved\u00a0Proposition HHH, a bond proposal the City Council placed on the ballot to authorize $1.2 billion in borrowing for\u00a0homeless housing. The bond program, however, is the\u00a0long-range element of the plan. Among its\u00a064 strategies, many involved procedural changes whose effects will be hard to measure. Among them are\u00a0a \u201ccontact card\u201d for\u00a0police to get homeless people into the services system, training of outreach workers to serve jail inmates and a request for proposals to improve the homeless database system.\u00a0 More\u00a0urgent remedies \u2014 getting assistance to the thousands of people living on the city\u2019s sidewalks \u2014 have met disappointments. Community opposition has\u00a0stalled\u00a0efforts\u00a0to build storage facilities for\u00a0homeless people\u2019s property in Venice and San Pedro, the report said. The San Pedro site has been abandoned. A mobile storage alternative is now being considered for the Venice site. Plans to provide mobile showers have also hit roadblocks.\u00a0One mobile shower company is working to launch operations this month but declined to become a city contractor. Other contractors are being sought, the report said. Several\u00a0items requiring City Council approval are moving slowly. Measures to create\u00a0parking zones for people living in vehicles and changes to the planning codes to speed the approval of housing are still months in the future. As the first attempt to bring order and accountability to the wide-ranging strategies proposed\u00a0by\u00a0City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana, the report generally won praise from members of the Council\u2019s Homelessness and Poverty Committee who reviewed it Wednesday. But Bonin expressed frustration with the pace of progress.\u00a0When told that 254\u00a0new crisis beds had been provided, Bonin said he could\u00a0not measure that\u00a0figure\u00a0against a goal and timeline. (Gale Holland and Doug Smith) \u201cI\u2019m hopeful, since much of the housing approved [under Proposition HHH] isn\u2019t going to come on line in a few weeks or months,\u00a0that these numbers dramatically escalate over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re looking at 28,000 people, 254 is really inadequate. I\u2019d like to see how these plans are going to ramp up so we can get that unsheltered number\u00a0down.\u201d During a back-and-forth at the committee hearing, Bonin also chided\u00a0city staff over delays in providing services to people living in vehicles. Analyst Jason Killeen of the City Administrative Office said a survey of the estimated 3,900 people living in vehicles would be required to develop a program of services for them. \u201cHow much data do you need?\u201d Bonin asked.\u00a0\u201cHow many do you need to survey to craft a program?\u201d Killeen said\u00a0that the California Environmental Quality Act would\u00a0require\u00a0the city to provide the data. \u201cI don\u2019t think that requires us to interview every person in a vehicle,\u201d Bonin said. While much of the progress described in the plan was procedural, involving the\u00a0streamlining of diverse homeless activities, there were several concrete achievements: The city received proposals from 49 developers to build permanent supportive housing on 12 city-owned parcels. Santana said a list of those selected will be announced next week. A study has been completed on a proposed\u00a0tax on new\u00a0residential and commercial developments based on the estimated demand for low-income housing they will create. The so-called linkage fee, estimated to raise up to about $1 billion over 10 years, would have to be approved by the City Council. The Los Angeles Police Department established four teams to work with homeless people. Nearly 800 officers have received mental health intervention training. Medical services personnel in city jails are now collecting information on homelessness, mental health and veteran status. The city allocated $10.8 million to fund 550 crisis and bridge housing beds and case management for about 2,300 people. The Los Angeles Housing Authority has established an incentive program to provide landlords up to $1,100 to hold apartments for housing voucher holders\u00a0while mandatory\u00a0inspections are being done. A pet services center opened on skid row in September, and\u00a0the Animal Services Department has applied for funding to provide alternative housing, including tents, for homeless people with pets. The Hilton Foundation and other philanthropic groups contributed $20 million to build the city\u2019s supportive housing loan fund to $65 million. The position of homeless coordinator was filled. In October the Homeless and Poverty Committee announced the selection of Meg Barclay, a veteran of nonprofit, federal and City Hall housing programs. She will work\u00a0with Los Angeles County and nonprofit agencies to tie the city\u2019s work into a regional structure. Her first assignment was completion of the progress report.

USA Today Network Meaghan M. McDermott, Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle 6:52 p.m. EST November 12, 2016 x Share Congressional Gold Medals were presented to two surviving World War II veterans and to others' family members on Veterans Day at the National Warplane Museum in Geneseo. Carlos Ortiz On his 91st birthday WWII veteran Wallace Higgins was amongst those five who received a Congressional Gold Medal on Veteran\u00d5s Day at the National Warplane Museum in Geneseo. (Photo: CARLOS ORTIZ/@CFORTIZ_DANDC/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) ROCHESTER, N.Y. \u2014 Wallace C. Higgins isn\u2019t a man who sheds many tears. But on Veterans Day, as Higgins held his Congressional Gold Medal during a ceremony in New York honoring the Tuskegee Airman , things were different. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough,\u201d said Higgins, 91, who left behind his education in 1943 to join the U.S. Army. After aptitude testing and basic training, he was selected to be part of the Tuskegee Airman experiment in Alabama, and was trained in pre-flight at the Tuskegee Institute. \u201cI don\u2019t cry easily, but I do today.\u201d Now a retired Alfred University professor, he recalled one of his first early flights in Alabama. \u201cI flew over a circle of cows and they just looked up at me,\u201d he said, laughing at the memory. \u201cSo I kept flying round and round over them, just watching them.\u201d Higgins was one of five Tuskegee Airmen honored on Friday at the National Warplane Museum in Geneseo. Stories of WWII bravery highlight Veterans Day ceremony In 2007, the honor of the Congressional Gold Medal was secured for all men and women involved in the Tuskegee Experience, the Army Air Forces program to train African-Americans to fly and maintain combat aircraft during World War II. Brooklyn native Herbert Thorpe, 93, joined the Army Reserves in 1942. He was commissioned a second lieutenant and earned his B-25 pilot\u2019s wings in October 1942. He, like Higgins and many other Tuskegee Airmen, was unable to attend that original 2007 ceremony. \u201cNot being able to be at that original presentation; this is very special to me,\u201d said Thorpe, who also received a Gold Medal for his brother Richard Thorpe, who was killed during an orientation flight in Italy in 1945. \u201cI have to thank so many people for this special occasion,\u201d he said. More than 200 people gathered for the event amid the museum\u2019s historic warplanes and military memorabilia. Rep. Christopher Collins, R-N.Y., presented the medals. \u201cAt a time in our history when African Americans faced tremendous prejudice, the five being honored here today remained committed to serving their country and laid the foundation so that anyone could serve, no matter their race,\u201d he said. Leland Pennington Leland Pennington, a Monroe County resident who was killed while serving in World War II. \u00a0(Photo: Democrat and Chronicle) Stephanie Keenan of Gates brought her sons Dylan and Logan, who had spent much of the week learning about the significance of Veterans Day. \u201cI wanted my children to see a piece of history being made right here,\u201d said Keenan, noting that her father is a veteran. \u201cToday has special importance to our family too.\u201d Bernadine Lutz of Rochester came to receive the Gold Medal for her cousin Leland H. Pennington, a member of the 301st Fighter Squadron who was shot down and killed while on a bombing mission over the Ploesti oil fields in Romania. \u201cThis really is so wonderful and all members of my family, those with us and those who are not, would be so proud of this,\u201d said Lutz. She was accompanied by another Pennington cousin, Alfred Fields. \u201cIt is important to note that African Americans have fought in every war this country\u2019s had,\u201d he said, adding that that history must never be lost. \u201cAnd members of my family have fought in three.\u201d Also honored during the ceremony was Robert M. Johnson, a Pittsburgh native who enlisted in the Army Air\u00a0Forces in 1943. He was killed in\u00a0service on\u00a0Dec. 5, 1944. Johnson\u2019s next of kin were delayed in travel and unable to attend the ceremony. 160 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fn28kD ",

(Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Jason Meisner and Grace Wong Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Carrying signs and chanting, \u201cNot my president,\u201d thousands of people marched through the streets of downtown Chicago on Saturday to protest President-elect Donald Trump. On the fourth day of demonstrations since the Tuesday election, protesters walked shoulder to shoulder down the Magnificent Mile to Millennium Park, pausing outside the Trump Tower along the Chicago River where police set up barricades to keep them from getting close. \u201cNo Trump, no KKK, no racist USA!\u201d they shouted, some thrusting middle fingers in the air toward the 98-story skyscraper stamped with the Trump name. Along the route, motorists honked horns in support and curious tourists and shoppers stopped to snap cellphone photos of the marchers. One man in a red University of Wisconsin sweatshirt shouted, \u201cGo Trump!\u201d as the crowd passed, but he was drowned out by protesters singing, \u201cAll you need is love.\u201d Warning: Contains graphic language and images. Thousands\u00a0of people again marched through streets in downtown Chicago on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2016, protesting\u00a0the election of Donald Trump as president.\u00a0They also joined a group at Federal Plaza protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline. \u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d said Gloria Jackson, 53, who stepped out of Ronnie\u2019s Original Chicago Steak House on West Randolph Street to let her 11-year-old grandson shoot some video on her phone. \u201cPeople can let their voices be heard. That\u2019s what this country is all about, whether you\u2019re for Trump or against him.\u201d At least two groups participated in marches in and around the Loop and the Near North Side, according to organizers and police. The crowd was mostly young and very diverse, some marching in bluejeans and sweaters while others wore bandannas across their faces and militant garb. The crowd swelled to as large as several thousand at one point as protesters marched back up Michigan Avenue to Ohio Street before being turned south by police to head through River North to Federal Plaza. There, they joined with another group protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline for a mid-afternoon rally. By 3 p.m., the protesters had dwindled to a few hundred as Native American chants echoed through the plaza and demonstrators linked arms and danced. Trump protests continue for fourth day Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune A group of Native Americans lead people protesting the DAPL during a march from Federal Plaza to Trump Tower in Chicago on Saturday, November 12, 2016. A group of Native Americans lead people protesting the DAPL during a march from Federal Plaza to Trump Tower in Chicago on Saturday, November 12, 2016. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) Although loud and occasionally vulgar, the demonstrators were peaceful. Only two arrests, for obstructing traffic, were reported, according to police. \u201c(It went) fantastically,\u201d said Chicago police Lt. Godfrey Cronin, who was stationed at Federal Plaza around 3 p.m. \u201cA bunch of young people got together, they didn\u2019t know each other, they controlled the crowd wonderfully and everybody peacefully protested, got their message out.\u201d The ongoing Chicago demonstrations were among several held across the country, including in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Oakland, Calif., in the wake of Trump\u2019s stunning defeat of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Thousands of protesters took to Chicago\u2019s streets for nearly nine hours Wednesday and into early Thursday in an intense show of opposition to the president-elect. On Thursday evening, about 50 young people gathered at Trump Tower to protest, and a small group also demonstrated on Friday. The Chicago events have been relatively peaceful and devoid of any of the heavy vandalism or effigy burning that occurred in other cities. Trump protests continue for fourth day Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune A group of people protesting both the DAPL and the election of Donald Trump rally in front of Trump Tower in Chicago on Saturday, November 12, 2016. A group of people protesting both the DAPL and the election of Donald Trump rally in front of Trump Tower in Chicago on Saturday, November 12, 2016. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) As they had in previous protests, police on Saturday used bicycles to set up rolling barricades and keep the marchers to certain streets. At times, the protesters had to compete with the usual throngs of Saturday shoppers and tourists. Access to The Bean sculpture in Millennium Park had been restricted beginning in late morning, but those restrictions were later lifted to the joy of scores of tourists who had gone downtown on the sunny, crisp autumn afternoon. Earlier, protesters were in the River North area and also marched near Nordstrom on Michigan Avenue, but shopping appeared to go on unabated. The event was organized by Dustin Kloeppel, 20, who on late Wednesday created a Facebook event titled \u201cMillennium Park Protest\u201d that he thought would attract only family and friends. Instead, he found himself surrounded by hundreds of people Saturday morning. Kloeppel said he hopes the protest will encourage people to stay involved in the political process and to vote. \u201cI would really like to fight xenophobia, racism, sexism, transhomophobia, Islamophobia, all that stuff, because bigotry is not a beautiful thing and we need more beautiful things in our communities and in our lives,\u201d said Kloeppel, of Rogers Park.

The scoring drive covered 53 yards in eight plays and took 3:11.\u00a0 The Trojans have made two mistakes in their first two series that have been somewhat costly, between Darnold's interception and Petite's dropped pass\u00a0that would have been a first down.\u00a0 The good news for the Trojans is that they've been able to move the ball really well against the Huskies' defense so far.\u00a0 Deontay Burnett caught two passes in the series, one for 20 yards and another for two.\u00a0 Nov. 12, 2016, 5:03 p.m. No. 4 Washington leads USC, 3-0, in the first quarter Washington kicked a 43-yard field goal and leads USC, 3-0, with 3:58 to play in the first quarter. The scoring drive covered 45 yards in 10 plays and took 5:05.\u00a0 The Trojans' defense has done a nice job not allowing the Huskies\u00a0to get around the edge, but the secondary has given up a few big plays. Jake Browning converted twice on third down with a 13-yard and then a 12-yard pass to John Ross.\u00a0 Ross has three catches for 49 yards.\u00a0 Nov. 12, 2016, 4:54 p.m. Sam Darnold throws interception in opening series USC was moving the ball well until Sam Darnold\u00a0threw into triple coverage and was intercepted\u00a0by Taylor Rapp. The Huskies will take over on their own 29-yard line. The Trojans were cruising down the field, with the exception of two false starts by Damien Mama. Ronald Jones II rushed for 14 yards in three carries, and JuJu Smith-Schuster caught two passes for 30 yards. The Trojans converted twice on third down. It is a good thing that USC Coach Clay Helton blasted the Washington fight song all week at practice. This place is loud.\u00a0 Nov. 12, 2016, 4:44 p.m. USC makes a big stop in first defensive series Lindsey Thiry Washington came out firing, but USC's defense made two nice plays and the Huskies punted. Jake Browning completed a short pass to John Ross III that turned into a 23-yard gain on the first play of the game. Then, Browning completed a nine-yard pass to Myles Gaskin before the speedy Ross was tracked down by Uchenna Nwosu and tackled in the backfield. That stop was a drive-changer for the Trojans.\u00a0 Browning's deep third-down pass fell incomplete. Husky Stadium is loud.\u00a0 Nov. 12, 2016, 4:08 p.m. USC injury updates Lindsey Thiry USC tailbacks Justin Davis and Aca'Cedric Ware are suited and expected to play tonight against Washington. Davis has been since sidelined the last three weeks because of a high-ankle sprain. Ware was sidelined last week against Oregon after he sprained his ankle during practice. Defensive lineman\u00a0Stevie Tu'ikolovatu\u00a0suffered a knee injury against Oregon last week\u00a0but is likely to play tonight. Nov. 12, 2016, 3:41 p.m. USC returns to Husky Stadium for first time since 2009 Lindsey Thiry No shirt, no problem for USC receiver Jalen Greene. Greene ran onto the field for warmups without a top on, even though it's windy and cold in Seattle with ominous\u00a0skies. So far this afternoon, the rain has held off, and forecasts say it should remain dry throughout the night. USC last played at Husky Stadium in 2009, before it underwent renovations. The then-No. 3 Trojans were upset by Washington, 16-13, on a last-minute field goal.\u00a0 Last season the Huskies defeated the Trojans, 17-12, at the Coliseum.\u00a0 Nov. 12, 2016, 3:45 p.m. REPORTING FROM SEATTLE Nathan Fenno (Ezra Shaw / Getty Images) He may not be a perfect fit at other places, but he\u2019s a perfect fit at Washington. Skip Hall, who spent 12 years as an assistant at Washington under legendary coach Don James and is a close friend of Petersen On the floor below the conference room where Chris Petersen meets with a small contingent from the news media each week, reminders of Washington\u2019s past success on the football field fill a series of glass display cases. The front page of a local newspaper from Petersen\u2019s introduction as head coach on a December afternoon almost three years ago is wedged in a corner next to scratched-up helmets and vintage jerseys. The headline hasn\u2019t faded: \u201cDream hire.\u201d That\u2019s the level of expectation Petersen brought from Boise State to Washington, and it\u2019s being realized on the field. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just something that\u2019s happened by fate or by luck,\u201d said Skip Hall, who spent 12 years as an assistant at Washington under legendary coach Don James and is a close friend of Petersen. \u201cHe may not be a perfect fit at other places, but he\u2019s a perfect fit at Washington.\u201d ",

We were once again up in all but two of the battleground states, and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing. And we were feeling like we had put it back together,\" she continued. The surprise announcement of a revival of the shuttered FBI inquiry came at a time when the campaign was riding high, Clinton said. \"After the third debate, we felt so good about where we were,\" she said. Trump's performance in the Oct. 19 debate was widely panned, especially his refusal to say that he would respect the outcome of the election if he lost. Democrats called him a sore loser. \"We were up considerably in all but two of the battleground states where we were tied or one behind, according to our data,\" Clinton said. \"We were tied in Arizona. We just had a real wind at our back,\" before the first, stunning letter from Comey. Nine days ago, FBI Director James Comey shook the political world with a letter to Congress noting that emails \"pertinent\" to the investigation of Hillary Clinton 's private email server had been discovered on a computer owned by former congressman Anthony Weiner , D-N.Y., the estranged husband of... Nine days ago, FBI Director James Comey shook the political world with a letter to Congress noting that emails \"pertinent\" to the investigation of Hillary Clinton 's private email server had been discovered on a computer owned by former congressman Anthony Weiner , D-N.Y., the estranged husband of... (Chris Cillizza) Clinton's campaign insisted the reopened inquiry would turn up nothing, and many Democrats accused Comey of partisan motives. He was once a registered Republican. Comey has not commented publicly on either letter. His defenders have said there was no partisan intent and that he should not be blamed for Clinton's loss to an opponent who ultimately had a deeper well of support among voters. Clinton did not accuse Comey of partisanship Saturday. But she did say that what should have been good news essentially backfired. Comey issued another letter to Congress on the Sunday before Election Day, concluding that the nine-day examination of newly discovered emails had turned up nothing to change his earlier conclusion that there had been no criminal conduct. \"Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would - saying there was no there there - was a real motivator for Trump's voters,\" Clinton said. (David A. Fahrenthold, Rosalind S. Helderman, Jenna Johnson) A day earlier, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri had told the same group of donors something similar - that the news angered Trump voters and caused a spike in turnout, while Clinton's projected turnout fell. \"Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,\" Clinton said. The Democrat focused on the outside events she said affected her campaign in the last three weeks of the election. She said nothing about other, larger forces at work - Trump's message of change in a restive time, his pledge to represent the aggrieved working class, the difficulty of any political party winning a third consecutive presidential term, her own limited attention to economic anxiety or the sexism and discomfort that surrounded her attempt to become the first female president. Palmieri had pointed blame at much of that Friday. Neither she nor Clinton herself addressed how Clinton's decision seven years ago to use a private system for her government communication had opened the door to the FBI inquiry in the midst of her second run for the White House. Clinton has said the decision was a mistake. \"I am heartbroken,\" she said Saturday, with a sad laugh. \"I'm not going to pretend otherwise. This is a very, very tough loss and especially because everyone worked so hard.\" Before Clinton spoke Saturday, her finance director had congratulated the group of top fundraisers for bringing in more than half of the nearly $1 billion raised for Clinton's campaign. The National Finance Committee, as it was known, was made up of donors who amassed, or \"bundled\" at least $100,000 in donations from others. Finance director Dennis Cheng ran through numbers that illustrate how heavily Clinton relied upon big donors: The campaign raised $972 million, \"of which 56 percent was generated by the people on this call.\" More than 3 million people contributed. The campaign held more than 1,500 fundraising events, of which Clinton herself attended nearly 400. ",

The officer was expected to survive and was undergoing emergency surgery, department spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said. The wounded officer and another officer who responded exchanged gunfire with the man, who was killed. The shooting happened before 5 a.m. in downtown Anchorage as the officer was responding to reports of a theft suspect in the area on foot. \"The officer was pulling his patrol vehicle over and a man brandished a gun and started firing at the officer,\" Castro says in an email to The Associated Press. Additional officers arrived and provided first aid to both the officer and the suspect, who was declared dead, Castro said. Police haven't released the shooter's name. Per department policy, the names of the two officers who fired their weapons will not be released for three days. Both the department and the state will conduct reviews to determine if the use of force was within department guidelines and justified. Castro says the department will hold a news conference later Saturday morning to provide updates. It's the second shooting involving Alaska officers in the past month. Sgt. Allen Brandt, an 11-year veteran of the Fairbanks Police Department, was shot Oct. 16. He died Oct. 28 in Anchorage of complications during surgery. Brandt was attacked as he responded to calls of a shooting in a neighborhood east of downtown Fairbanks. Video from his dashboard camera showed his car slowing to a stop as Anthony Jenkins-Alexie, 29, approached on foot on the sidewalk. The video showed Jenkins-Alexie, armed with a handgun, dashing in front of the car. Prosecutors say Jenkins-Alexie shot Brandt as Brandt tried to take cover behind his patrol car. He was hit six times. Jenkins-Alexie is charged with first- and second-degree murder and other counts. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy As early as Wednesday morning, aides began to explain to Democrats shaken by the loss that the campaign\u2019s sophisticated data modeling had not taken into account the bombshell F.B.I. announcement. Mr. Comey\u2019s letters to Congress went against the F.B.I.\u2019s longstanding tradition of avoiding decisions that could affect elections, but he told aides that he felt he had no choice because he had already weighed in on the case so publicly. In July, he had taken the unusual step of publicly announcing that the F.B.I. would not charge Mrs. Clinton. At the time, she believed she had finally put the issue to rest. And after the final debate on Oct. 19 in Las Vegas, she emerged in such a strong position that she began to focus on campaigning for down-ballot Democrats and planned a campaign stop in traditionally Republican Arizona. \u201cWe felt so good about where we were,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told donors. Before Mr. Comey\u2019s first letter to Congress, she added, \u201cwe just had a real wind at our back.\u201d Mr. Trump seized on the letter, telling voters in Nevada the Saturday before Election Day that \u201cthe F.B.I. has reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton,\u201d and that the matter \u201cwould grind government to a halt\u201d should Mrs. Clinton win the White House. The F.B.I.\u2019s examination of the new emails did not in fact reopen the investigation. Democratic pollsters attributed Mr. Trump\u2019s laser-thin victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 states that President Obama had won \u2014 largely to a drifting of college-educated suburban women to the Republican nominee at the last minute, because of the renewed focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server. \u201cWe lost with college-educated whites after leading with them all summer,\u201d a Clinton spokesman, Brian Fallon, said on Wednesday. \u201cFive more days of reminders about Comey, and they gravitated back to Trump.\u201d Before Mrs. Clinton spoke on Saturday, her finance director, Dennis Cheng, thanked the donors on the call, each of whom had raised at least $100,000. The campaign brought in nearly $1 billion to spend heavily on data efforts, to disperse hundreds of staff members to battleground states, and to air television advertisements \u2014 only to fall short to Mr. Trump\u2019s upstart operation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Donors conceded that, ultimately, no amount of money could match Mr. Trump\u2019s crisp pitch, aimed at the economically downtrodden, to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d \u201cYou can have the greatest field program, and we did \u2014 he had nothing,\u201d said Jay S. Jacobs, a prominent New York Democrat and donor to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cYou can have better ads, paid for by greater funds, and we did. Unfortunately, Trump had the winning argument.\u201d Mrs. Clinton has kept a low profile since her concession speech at a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Wednesday. On Thursday, a young mother with her 13-month-old daughter spotted Mrs. Clinton walking her dogs near her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., posting a photo of the defeated candidate on Facebook that quickly went viral along with the hashtag #ImStillWithHer. On Friday night, Mrs. Clinton thanked volunteers on a nationwide conference call. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cThese have been very, very tough days.\u201d Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .

USA TODAY NETWORK Marta Lunez, a Hillary Clinton supporter, reacts to Donald Trump's success on election night at the Javits Center in New York on Nov. 8, 2016. (Photo: Don Emmert, AFP/Getty Images) More than 200 hate incidents\u00a0\u2014\u00a0ranging from swastika graffiti\u00a0to physical threats \u2014 have been reported across the country since Donald Trump's election, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit that monitors hate groups in the USA. Now many people of color, women and LGBT people who\u00a0have long faced threats large and small\u00a0must\u00a0grapple\u00a0with the knowledge\u00a0that half of their fellow American who voted elected someone who has advocated policies aimed\u00a0at them: Keeping Muslims and immigrants out of the country, using police tactics considered racially biased such as stop-and-frisk , and grabbing women without consent. Harry Reid calls Trump 'sexual predator' who fueled his campaign with hate They are part of the other half of Americans who voted, many of whom\u00a0 wept on election night \u00a0and since, crying not because their horse in the race lost\u00a0but because they fear for their safety and well-being. \"I think it's normal in any election, one side is going to demonize the other,\" says Monnica Williams,\u00a0a licensed clinical psychologist. \"In this case, Trump actually said those awful things about women, about minorities, and he stands by those remarks,\" Williams says.\u00a0\"It's very scary for people who are part of marginalized and stigmatized communities.\" And yet, many people who are upset have been told,\u00a0even by Trump opponents, to calm down \u2014 that it was just an election and that America would continue as it always has. don't tell me to \"relax\" and \"take it easy\" when everything i am and believe in is on the line \u2014 sad eggplant (@raneemisabbos) November 9, 2016 \"To say that this was just another election is blindly ignorant to just how ... viscerally this campaign ripped open the wounds of racial resentment in this country,\"\u00a0says\u00a0Ryan Lenz,\u00a0a Southern Poverty Law Center spokesperson.\u00a0\u00a0\"And if it's not apparent to you now, I believe it soon will be.\" Indeed, for many people who aren't straight, white American males, these latest hate incidents come on top of a year that\u00a0was already terrifying and degrading. Trump's victory leaves black community reeling \u2022 Five months ago to the day, 49 people were gunned down at Pulse , a gay nightclub in Orlando. It was the deadliest attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. \u2022\u00a0A week before that, the Stanford sexual assault survivor highlighted the disregard many rape victims endure\u00a0after her attacker, Brock Turner, received a six-month sentence. ( He served just\u00a0three months .) \u2022\u00a0A month later, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were shot and killed by police in separate incidents within a day of one\u00a0another. Pulse, Stanford, Sterling and Castile weren't isolated incidents: \u2022\u00a0This year, 385 black, Hispanic and Native American people have been shot and killed by police, according to\u00a0 The Guardian .\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0Every two minutes, an American is sexually assaulted, according to the\u00a0 Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network . \u2022\u00a0More than 1,114 people were victims of hate crimes because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, according the\u00a0 FBI's 2014 data . The outbreak of post-election violence aimed at minority groups is \"not that surprising\" given the language heard and violence seen at Trump rallies, Lenz says. \"Over the course of\u00a0his campaign, Donald Trump has blown a\u00a0 dog whistle \u00a0at a number of far-right ideologies from anti-Muslim extremists to flat-out\u00a0neo-Nazis,\" says\u00a0Lenz. \"With his election, many racists feel they've been legitimized.\" Some Trump supporters \u2014 former KKK grand wizard David Duke or students who chanted \"build the wall,\" for instance \u2014 openly praised this rhetoric. Make no mistake about it - Donald J. Trump owes his victory to -> THE SOUTH! #AmericaFirst #ElectionNight #ElectionResults #PresidentTrump pic.twitter.com/zJibIkNaIm Fact check: Trump\u2019s David Duke amnesia But many Trump voters looked past his words, rather than condoned them. Exit polls in Wisconsin , a big win for Trump, show that 21% of voters who had a negative opinion of him voted for him anyway. \"I don't want to give the impression that everyone who voted for Trump is a racist,\" says Williams, who pointed to economic issues, abortion and problems with Hillary Clinton as other reasons for Trump's victory.\u00a0\"That being said, I think there were a number of people who were racist who said, 'it's about time someone is saying these things.'\" Trump\u2019s campaign, however, has objected to the idea that he has encouraged racism. \u201cWe totally disavow hateful rhetoric,\u201d\u00a0spokeswoman Hope Hicks has said. \u201cOnline or otherwise.\u201d The Southern Poverty Law Center has called on Trump to \"distance himself\" from \"extremists.\" \"This violence that is starting to boil over is a reminder of how much work we have to do now to bridge the cultural gaps that are apparent in this country,\" Lenz says. \"This election does not legitimize racial hatred.\" Posted!

By Dan Balz November 12 at 1:31 PM Follow @danbalz The battle for Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is underway, and there\u2019s nothing orderly about it. Washington is rife with rumor, speculation and trepidation. The rest of the country is in the dark and divided. Trump always said he liked to be unpredictable, and so it is left to others right now to imagine how all the conflicts, contradictions and questions will be resolved. Two signs of the absence of clarity came Friday when Trump reshuffled the leadership of his transition team, jettisoning New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and some of his loyalists and installing Vice President-elect Mike Pence to run the show. At the same time came suggestions that Trump might back away from several key campaign pledges, raising once again the question of what his real convictions are. These might just be hiccups. If not, look out. One big question ahead is which Donald Trump will emerge after Inauguration Day. Will it be the bombastic Trump of the campaign, the one who insulted his rivals and offended one group of people after another? Or will it be the more temperate, subdued and inclusive-sounding Trump who has been on display since the electoral college vote turned stunningly and decisively in his favor early Wednesday morning? Republicans spent months encouraging Trump to \u201cpivot\u201d to a more presidential style. He resisted, believing that what got him the nomination and would get him the presidency was to knock his rivals as hard as possible and to be as provocative as he could at his campaign rallies. That was the role he adopted to win. No one has a clue as to how he envisions the role of president \u2014 how he will address the American people, how he will interact with members of Congress, how he will deal with allies and adversaries. Trump ran as the outsider who would shake up the capital. By doing that, he became the tribune of the aggrieved, the left out, the people who have little regard for the views of Washington\u2019s elites. But he is a lifelong dealmaker, and Washington is the ultimate dealmaking town. But dealmaking connotes backrooms dominated by insiders making compromises. Do Trump\u2019s core followers want Washington to work better, or do they expect him to be more disruptive, a president who puts the establishment in its place? The Post\u2019s Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) [ Pence replaces Christie as Trump transition leader ] A third issue is playing out daily as the president-elect begins to populate the government he will take over in January. He promised in the closing weeks of the campaign to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. That is the rallying cry for a populist movement \u2014 Trump\u2019s movement. Inevitably, well-connected political insiders \u2014 lobbyists, lawyers, think-tank experts and members of the foreign policy establishment \u2014 will populate his transition. Who really will control a Trump government, the 45th president or those who could surround and smother him? Still another question is Trump\u2019s relationship to the Republican Party. Republicans now have what they\u2019ve dreamed about for years: control of the presidency, Congress and, assuming Trump gets his way, eventually the Supreme Court. They also control most of the governorships and state legislatures. Republicans have lost the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections, but their grip on power is pervasive. Republican congressional leaders are salivating over the prospect of having a free hand to enact a conservative agenda. But is their agenda the Trump agenda? House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has an agenda ready to go, but how much will Trump go along? They differ on trade and entitlements, among other things. Trump wants to spend big on roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and airports, and put millions of people to work doing so. If that isn\u2019t a big-government, Democratic initiative, what is? Trump presumably will want to put his stamp on things. If he regarded those congressional leaders as a corner of the swamp he wants to drain, as he suggested by his occasional tweets during the campaign, how does he avoid capitulating to the pressure now to act like a generic conservative Republican? Congressional leaders might see Trump as someone happy to delegate the substantive agenda to others. Trump knows the importance of developing and keeping his brand. When Bill Clinton was newly elected in the fall of 1992, he held a summit with congressional leaders and, in essence, ceded power to them to set the legislative agenda. Campaign proposals to clean up Washington \u2014 symbolic or otherwise \u2014 were pushed to the back burner in deference to entrenched powers. His signature proposal to reform the welfare system, the centerpiece of his effort to redraw the image of his own party, took a back seat to other initiatives in part because there was no appetite to confront the party\u2019s liberal base. Clinton later came to regret his decision to defer to Democratic congressional leaders. The analogy is imperfect but nonetheless holds lessons for Trump. The more he turns over the direction and priorities of his administration to congressional leaders, the more his anti-establishment message will fade to the background. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t care, but the people who supported him so passionately should. People look at a home in Youngstown, Pa., that features a huge cutout of President-elect Donald Trump. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) [ Trump advisers hedge on key campaign promises ] Trump has had little to say publicly since his victory. That has allowed the speculation machine to go into overdrive about his plans and the direction he intends to set. Because his operation speaks with many voices, because of the many factions now vying for attention and power, few people really know what Trump is thinking. One early indicator of that thinking will be the selection of a White House chief of staff. From various reports, the competitors include Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, a true insider and the favorite of GOP congressional leaders, and Steve Bannon, the architect of Breitbart News, a keeper of the alt-right flame and one of the key strategists for Trump in the final few months of the campaign. At this point eight years ago, then-President-elect Barack Obama had held his first news conference and had named his chief of staff. The identities of other top White House officials were well known. Trump has promised to move swiftly on top Cabinet positions and key White House jobs. Everyone knows that Trump prizes loyalty and has a long memory for slights and disparagements. What his governing principles and policy touchstones, particularly on foreign policy, amount to will be revealed in the choices he begins to make. Trump won the election by riding a populist revolt driven by people angry, as Dan McGinn and Peter Hart wrote in the Wall Street Journal, at the failure of elected officials, at the absence of secure borders, at the arrogance of the affluent and well educated, at the media and the smugness of many journalists, at their place in the new economy and about \u201cbeing mocked and vilified as rubes, racists and \u2018deplorables.\u2019 \u201d They are likely to cut Trump considerable slack as president, but they did not vote for him to succumb and become part of the swamp. One more thing. In the campaign between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, one side or the other was destined to come out of the election desperately unhappy and discouraged. These first days since Trump won have put people in leadership positions on their best behavior, despite the shocks to the political system and in particular to Clinton and her devastated team and Obama and his team, who now see the potential of his legacy unraveling. Clinton was gracious in her concession speech. The president said his priority is to ensure a smooth transition. Trump was respectful and appeared sobered by his 90-minute meeting in the Oval Office. But the street protests remind everyone of the toll the campaign has taken and of the divisions that remain. It will take more than a smooth transition to overcome all that. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

If Trump were to get everything he has proposed from a Republican-controlled Congress, a taxpayer who makes between\u00a0$48,000 to $83,000\u00a0a year would save about $1,000 under his plan, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. People in the top 0.01%, making $3.7 million or more in a year, would receive $1 million in annual tax savings. \"He is proposing tax cuts for the very people he ran against in his campaign,\" Gleckman said. How you could save under Trump's student loan repayment plan Expect significant tax changes under a Trump administration, according to\u00a0Howard Wagner, managing director at Crowe National Tax Services. If Trump sticks to his campaign promises, here are the major things his administration wants to change on individual taxes: Reduce seven federal tax brackets to three with rates of 12%, 25% and 33%. The top rate would fall from 39.6% to 33%. Increases the standard deduction from $6,300 to $15,000 for single filers and from $12,600 to $30,000 for married couples filing jointly while ending personal exemptions. Cap itemized deductions at $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married couples filing jointly. Eliminate the 3.8% tax on net investment income on people who have a modified adjusted gross income of over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly. Repeal the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. Trump has also proposed taxing income from carried interest at ordinary income tax rates, which will not only affect hedge fund managers, but high earners with investment income, said Joshua Milgrim,\u00a0a tax partner in Dechert's New York office. How Trump will pay for the tax cuts Trump has proposed no net spending reductions to offset his tax plan's $7 trillion increase in the debt, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's\u00a0 estimates . This is the type of identity theft that's taking seniors by surpirse \"I'm guessing Trump is going to care less about the details than just getting tax reform passed,\" said William Gale,\u00a0co-director of the\u00a0Tax Policy Center. Trump's plan borrows heavily from a\u00a0 tax proposal \u00a0from House Republicans. Gleckman will be watching what Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, will do because his plan is different from Trump's and the House GOP plan. Voters approved these state tax hikes Regardless, you will likely see changes to your taxes with a Trump administration. \"I think we are going to get major tax reform,\" Gale said. \"It is the one thing that unites the Republican Party and they have all the levelers of power.\" \u00a9 CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

    "text": "By Bob Woodward November 12 at 4:22 PM Follow @realbobwoodward One of the most important phases of the transition to power for President-elect Donald Trump includes briefings on U.S. intelligence capabilities and secret operations as well as separate descriptions of the extraordinary powers he will have over the military, especially contingency plans to use nuclear weapons, according to officials. In 2008, after then-President-elect Obama was given one sensitive intelligence briefing at a secure facility in Chicago, he joked, \u201cIt\u2019s good that there are bars on the windows here because if there weren\u2019t, I might be jumping out.\u201d Though Trump has been given some intelligence briefings on threats and capabilities, there are a series of separate briefs scheduled for the president-elect into what Obama has called \u201cour deep secrets.\u201d Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said she could not provide any information on the schedule for the briefings. Previous presidents received them over the course of the entire transition. First is a detailed look at technical and human intelligence sources and methods that provide critical information on Special Access Programs \u2014 the most sensitive top-secret undertakings \u2014 for drone strikes and other intelligence operations. This would include the disclosure, if Trump wants the names, of the dozens of officials abroad paid by the CIA, to the tune of millions of dollars. Though entitled, presidents normally have not asked for names unless the secret relationship involves a particularly important CIA asset. Other methods include the most sensitive technical capabilities of the National Security Agency to intercept communications abroad, store them and make them instantly available to analysts and operators. Trump will learn that the president is considered \u201cThe First Customer\u201d by the intelligence community, which has a tradition of responding to any and every presidential request. A second briefing will be on the covert actions undertaken by the CIA that are designed to change events abroad without the hand of the United States being revealed publicly. There are currently about a dozen such \u201cFindings\u201d \u2014 intelligence orders signed by the president. Some are broad authorities to conduct lethal counterterrorism operations in dozens of countries. Others are narrow, such as support for clandestine efforts in a single country to stop genocide or payments to political opposition or rebels. [ Amid a world of problems, Trump\u2019s policy prescriptions remain opaque ] Under law and procedures, such covert-action orders are issued by the office of the president, and Obama\u2019s orders will continue unless Trump, as president, changes them. Normally, the president-elect will review current covert actions and decide before the inauguration whether he wants to continue, modify or cease any. He also could add new covert operations after taking the oath. Obama received his briefing on covert action Dec. 9, 2008. Under law, the president can decide to launch new covert operations but must inform the Senate and House intelligence committees. For particularly sensitive operations, the president has to see only that the Gang of Eight is informed. The eight are the two party leaders of both the Senate and House, plus the chairman and ranking member of the intelligence committees. Among the most important \u201cFindings\u201d are counter-proliferation operations designed to prevent a country from obtaining a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapon delivery capability. Other operations are offensive aggressive cyberattacks involving stealthy computer hacking designed to break into computer systems of foreign governments. Previously, they have been called the Computer Network Attack (CNA) and are among the most highly secret undertakings of the U.S. government. In addition, Trump will receive information on domestic counterterrorism overseen by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. After the 9/11 attacks, the FBI was turned loose to stop the next attack. Efforts to penetrate banks, communications and foreign corporations in the United States have been significantly expanded. Trump will also be given information about \u201cContinuity of Government,\u201d which are the plans and procedures designed for implementing the line of presidential succession. That could be in case of a terrorist attack or other emergency in which the president dies or could not carry out the duties of his office. A third briefing will be on nuclear-war plans and options. The \u201cfootball,\u201d a briefcase carried by the military aide to the president, includes authentication codes designed to ensure that any launch order comes only from the commander in chief. The \u201cfootball\u201d also contains a book of options benignly called the \u201cPresidential Decision Handbook.\u201d This top secret/code-word book, known as the \u201cBlack Book,\u201d of about 75 pages has separate contingency plans for using nuclear weapons against potential adversaries such as Russia and China. [ Here\u2019s what you need to know about the button. (There is no button.) ] The president can select nuclear strike packages against three categories \u2014 military targets, war-supporting or economic targets and leadership targets. There are sub-options, and the menu allows a president to withhold attacks on specific targets. Two officials said that the \u201cBlack Book\u201d also includes estimates on the number of casualties for each of the main options that run into the millions, and in some cases over 100 million. Officials who have dealt with nuclear-war options said that learning the details can be horrifying and that there is a \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d feel to the whole enterprise. President-elect George W. Bush did not receive his briefing on nuclear options until five days before inauguration in 2001. Top White House officials say that presidents in the past have had no love and little interest in getting the nuclear war plans briefing and almost recoil at the prospect of having such authority. Under practice as the commander in chief, the president can employ U.S. military forces as he sees fit. The system of authentication and options is designed for quick response to attack in an emergency. A president might have to make a decision in a matter ofminutes with little or no time to consult the secretary of defense, military leaders or the National Security Council. In addition, Trump will receive briefings from the Pentagon on current military operations, including the deployments in the ongoing wars in Afghanistan, against the Islamic State and other Special Operations actions abroad. After one of the briefings in 2008, Obama told a close adviser that it was perhaps one of the most sobering experiences of his life. He said, \u201cI\u2019m inheriting a world that could blow up any minute in half a dozen ways, and I will have some powerful but limited and perhaps even dubious tools to keep it from happening.\u201d In an Oval Office interview on July 10, 2010, Obama confirmed that he had made that sort of comment. \u201cEvents are messy out there,\u201d he said. \u201cAt any given moment of the day, there are explosive, tragic, heinous, hazardous things taking place.\u201d He acknowledged that as president it was his responsibility to deal with all these problems. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018You\u2019re the most powerful person in the world. Why aren\u2019t you doing something about it?\u2019 \u201d The power of the presidency has two sides. On one, it is an extraordinary concentration of constitutional and legal authority. On the other, as Obama said, it can be limited and dubious. Soon, Trump will experience both the power and its limits. Evelyn Duffy contributed to this report. Read more: ",

Kellogg has been working closely with Trump adviser Flynn, advising the Trump campaign on matters relating to foreign policy and national security. (Gerald Herbert / AP) Matea Gold, Tom HamburgerThe Washington Post The chant echoed through Donald Trump 's boisterous rallies leading up to Election Day: \"Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!\" \"We are fighting for every citizen that believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests,\" the billionaire real estate developer promised exuberant supporters at his last campaign rally in Manchester, N.H. But just days later, there is little evidence that the president-elect is seeking to restrain wealthy interests from having access and influence in his administration. It's not just corporate lobbyists who are playing early, visible roles in the new power structure. Some of Trump's biggest political donors are shaping the incoming administration, including Rebekah Mercer, a daughter of billionaire Robert Mercer, who is figuring prominently in behind-the-scenes discussions, according to people familiar with the transition. Mercer is among four major donors appointed by Trump Friday to a 16-person executive committee overseeing his transition. The others are campaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin, New York financier Anthony Scaramucci and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. Meanwhile, top campaign fundraisers and a raft of lobbyists tied to some of the country's wealthiest industries have been put in charge of hiring and planning for specific federal agencies. They include J. Steven Hart, chairman of the law and lobbying shop Williams & Jensen; Michael McKenna, an energy company lobbyist who is overseeing planning for the Energy Department; and Dallas fundraiser Ray Washburne, was has been tapped to oversee the Commerce Department. Billionaires who served as Trump's policy advisers, such as Oklahoma oil executive Harold Hamm, are under consideration for Cabinet positions. And Trump is still working to fashion ethical guardrails that would wall him off from his sprawling real estate empire. On Friday, the Trump Organization said it was focused on identifying how to \"immediately transfer\" management to his three oldest children - an arrangement government ethics experts said was fraught with conflicts, particularly since his children are also helping oversee the transition. Meredith McGehee, who heads policy and strategy for Issue One, a bipartisan group that aims to reduce the influence of wealthy interests on politics, said there is \"tremendous dissonance\" between Trump's rhetoric and early actions. \"Much of what he said was, 'I'm going to change the game,' \" she said. \"Of all of his messages, that one I think clearly resonated the strongest. That's going to be incredibly difficult when the people you bring in are the experts at making the game work for them.\" Trump aides and transition officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment about what role donors and lobbyists will play in the administration. In the few days since Trump's surprise win, Washington's lobbying industry - which largely eschewed his candidacy - has clamored for a spot in the incoming administration. The transition team, which is scrambling to make 4,000 political appointments in less than three months, has welcomed lobbyists' involvement and expertise, according to people familiar with the operation. Fresh from a successful battle against a Democratic opponent, Donald Trump \u2019s attention must now turn to defining his presidency. His campaign offered two divergent approaches. He was a disruptive rabble-rouser\u00a0when it came to general demeanor and his immigration and national security stances. He... Fresh from a successful battle against a Democratic opponent, Donald Trump \u2019s attention must now turn to defining his presidency. His campaign offered two divergent approaches.

(Cathleen Decker and Evan Halper) \"Every presidential candidate at one time or another runs against Washington,\" said energy lobbyist Scott H. Segal. \"But the last thing in the world any newly elected president wants to do is go into complicated issues with blinders on. As a result, they look to people as advisers and implementers that have a full understanding of the subject matter they are supposed to address.\" The courting started before Election Day, when trade association representatives and lobbyists were invited to transition policy developments sessions. Lobbyists were solicited to give up to $5,000 to finance the transition, a fundraising effort that accelerated last week as the team seeks to collect about $3 million more to hit a $5 million budget, according to a person familiar with the situation. Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, president of BGR Public Relations, said \"all the Washington regulars\" participated in the policy meetings, but added that such access is no guarantee Trump will take his cues from K Street. \"Just because a transition task force makes a recommendation doesn't mean that Donald Trump will follow it,\" he said. Still, the prominence of established Washington figures and wealthy donors comes as a jarring contrast to Trump's unequivocal rhetoric on the campaign trail, when he decried inside-the-Beltway denizens as \"corrupt.\" Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Full Donald Trump victory speech Donald Trump's complete victory speech in New York City after he was elected the 45th president of the United States.

Nov. 9, 2016. (The White House)\u00a0 Delivering a statement the day after the presidential election, President Barack Obama said he was encouraged by Trump's call for reconciliation. Nov. 9, 2016. (The White House)\u00a0 Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bush's press secretary, said the policy decisions Trump makes in the early days will directly reflect on his credibility. \"The transition affords him an opportunity to show he's going to govern consistent with the promises he made,\" Fleischer said. \"If you are a reformer and you genuinely want to change the system, you ban people who you say you're going to ban. Anything less starts to represent compromise.\" Michael Toner, who served as general counsel to the Bush-Cheney transition in 2000, said the 10-week period after the election is a key moment for establishing broad ethical policies that will govern the incoming administration. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to take several specific actions regarding lobbyists, including prohibiting White House and congressional officials from lobbying for five years after they leave government service. But his transition team has already rolled back some of the restrictions on lobbyists that Barack Obama established for his transition operation in 2008. Among the rules that have been discarded: a ban on lobbyists from contributing financially to the transition and a prohibition on lobbyists working on the transition from overseeing any fields of policy on which they had lobbied in the previous year. Several prominent lobbyists are overseeing the staffing of departments in which their clients have a direct interest, including energy adviser Michael Catanzaro, a partner at the lobbying firm CGCN, who has represented oil services giant Halliburton, Koch Industries and the petrochemical and refining association American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.

Clinton said, \"Our analysis is that Comey\u2019s letter raised doubts that were groundless and baseless...\" and \"stopped our momentum,\" a DNC fundraising source who was on the call told Fox News. Clinton made the remark on a roughly 30-minute conference call with Democrats who raised more than $100,000, according to Politico . The former State Department leader lost in a surprising defeat to Republican nominee Donald Trump -- a first-time candidate who essentially trailed in almost every major poll for the entire campaign. FBI Director James Comey told Congress in an Oct. 30 letter that the agency was looking at emails found in an unrelated case that could be related to a closed FBI case specifically about the Clinton emails. Clinton suggested her campaign\u2019s internal poll numbers plunged after the letter but nevertheless rebounded, a person on the Saturday call told Politico. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 However, she said the second Comey letter, three days before Election Day, saying that she had essentially been cleared in the unrelated case, awakened Trump voters. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The FBI investigated Clinton using a private email server system while secretary of state. Comey said some of the emails included classified information and that she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her action. But he concluded the case in July without recommending criminal charges. Clinton on Thursday told her campaign staff that she had \u201cstepped in it\u201d by saying half of Trump\u2019s supporters were \u201cdeplorables,\u201d according to The New York Times.

The crowd of at least 500,000 people, according to Reuters, held candles and signs reading \"Resign,\" sang pop songs and patriotic numbers, and marched together toward the Blue House, the presidential home and office complex. \"It's an explosion of their feelings,\" demonstrator Jinwon Kim says of the crowds. \"People are very angry.\" Park has twice-apologized for a ballooning scandal that revealed her friend of four decades, Choi Soon-sil, who is the daughter of a self-proclaimed cult leader, was getting advance policy information and speeches with which to advise the president on a range of state affairs. Choi had no government experience or official position, and she is said to have been doing her counseling in secret.

An estimated 27,000 law enforcement, a mix of professional and conscripted officers, stood in riot gear to maintain peace. And despite a swelling crowd that organizers estimated at one million \u2014 which would make this the largest protest in South Korean history \u2014 the crowd was largely peaceful for the rally that stretched from mid-afternoon into late night. \"I'm not really worried about the future because the people are gathering,\" Kim said. \"So I think our democracy has a bright future. We're getting better and better. Our democracy is developing.\" Members of the three main opposition parties in South Korea joined the rally and its leaders took turns on various stages set up along Seoul's main drag. So far, there's no move to impeach the president, who has another year left in her term. Park has made concessions to try and salvage her job, dismissing senior aides, and allowing lawmakers to appoint a prime minister and give him wide control of domestic affairs. Her approval rating remains at a dismal 5 percent for the second week in a row. It's the lowest approval number for a democratically-elected president in South Korean history. ",

    "text": "Voters target Electoral College members to switch their Trump ballots, elect Clinton Published               November 12, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Voters upset that Republican Donald Trump had been elected president -- or think that the presidency was unfairly taken from Democratic rival Hillary Clinton -- are scrambling for ways to change the results. Their major focus is trying to get members of the U.S. Electoral College to change their vote, arguing that Clinton should be the next president because 60.47 Americans voted for her, compared to 60 million for Trump. \u00a0 The college is part of the Constitution and is composed of 538 members, with each state and the District of Columbia having one member, or electorate, for every senator or House lawmaker. Trump won 290 of the so-called electoral votes, in the race to get a minimum 270. However, members don\u2019t officially cast their ballots until December 19, which has Trump opponents making long-shot efforts to reverse the outcome, including petition drives to get the electorates to switch their votes. The largest effort is through the website Change.org, which as of Saturday has about 3 million signatures, getting closer to its goal of 4.5 million. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Petition organizers argue on the site that some states don\u2019t require their electorates to vote for the presidential nominee who had the most votes in their state. And for electorates in states that by law require them to ballot for the nominee who won the most votes, \u201ctheir vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine,\u201d the organizers write. \u201cWe can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay!\u201d One online petition signer wrote on the site via Twitter: \u201cIt\u2019s our chance of getting Trump out of the whitehouse.\u201d Another grassroots petition drive is being launched by Faithlessnow.com, as reported by Yahoo News. Organizers in that drive are targeting roughly 160 Republican electorates in the 15 states that Trump won and don\u2019t have laws bounding the electorates to the winner: Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. The most recent presidential election in which a nominee won the popular vote but lost the election through the Electoral College vote was 2000, when Democrat Al Gore lost to Republican George W. Bush following a days-long recount of votes in Florida and other states. Clinton and Trump at the time purportedlycalled for an end to the entire Electoral College system. And renewed calls emerged after Election Day 2016, on Tuesday, in large part because voters think the system is no longer needed to safeguard the country from a dangerous president. A Baltimore Sun editorial this weekend called the college a \u201cconvoluted system\u201d and \u201cthe product of an 18th century compromise forged over issues that no longer apply and resting on assumptions about the wisdom of the average person we no longer hold.\u201d \u201cIt is not worked the way it was intended almost from the very beginning,\u201d continued the editorial, which also suggests that U.S. states follow Maryland\u2019s lead by essentially joining a movement that could side-step needing a constitutional amendment to change the system. \u00a0 ",

Defense Secretary Ash Carter says the apparent suicide bomber killed four Americans \u2014 two service members and two contractors \u2014 and wounded 17 others. The bombing comes two days after a German diplomatic mission in northern Afghanistan also suffered a deadly suicide attack .

The blast occurred as the military personnel were moving between morning physical exercises and a dining hall, according to the official. The official also said that one thing being looked at is whether the bomber was someone who worked at the base or whether the bomber infiltrated security at the base. Carter said that force protection for the 9,800 American troops in Afghanistan \"is always a top priority, and we will investigate this tragedy to determine any steps we can take to improve it.\" \"For those who carried out this attack, my message is simple. We will not be deterred in our mission to protect our homeland and help Afghanistan secure its own future,\" said Carter. The attack occurred at just after 5:30 a.m., according to the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack, which they said was carried out by a suicide bomber . Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said the bomber managed to enter the base with explosives and detonate himself among American servicemembers who were in the midst of doing their morning exercise. General John W. Nicholson, commander of Resolute Support for the U.S. Army, said in a statement, \"To the family and friends of those who lost their lives today, we share your loss and our thoughts are with you. We offer you our deepest condolences. For the family and friends of those wounded in today\u2019s attack, let me assure you they are receiving the best care possible, and we will keep them in our thoughts today.\" He added: \"To those who target Coalition forces, ANDSF, and Afghan civilians, Resolute Support and USFOR-A will continue to pursue our Train, Advise, and Assist mission to help our partners create a better Afghanistan.\" ABC News' James Meek and Aleem Agha contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

By Anne Gearan November 12 at 1:54 PM Follow @agearan The morning after losing the presidential election to Donald Trump, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton steps onto the stage to deliver her concession speech. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) \u00a0 Hillary Clinton blamed the renewed FBI inquiry into her State Department email system for blunting her momentum in the presidential election and the closure of that inquiry two days before Election Day for energizing voters for Donald Trump. \u201cThere are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,\u201d Clinton told top donors on a farewell conference call Saturday. \u201cBut our analysis is that [FBI Director James B.] Comey\u2019s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum,\u201d she said. [ A series of strategic mistakes likely sealed Clinton\u2019s fate ] \u201cWe dropped, and we had to keep really pushing ahead to regain our advantage \u2014 which going into the last weekend, we had. We were once again up in all but two of the battleground states, and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing. And we were feeling like we had put it back together,\u201d she continued. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said the letter from FBI Director James Comey announcing an inquiry into additional emails was \"pretty strange\" and \"unprecedented\" with days to go before Election Day. Clinton told supporters at a rally in Daytona Beach, Fla., that voters \"deserve to get full and complete facts.\" (The Washington Post) The surprise announcement of a revival of the shuttered FBI inquiry came at a time when the campaign was riding high, Clinton said. \u201cAfter the third debate, we felt so good about where we were,\u201d she said. Trump's performance in the Oct. 19 debate was widely panned, especially his refusal to say that he would respect the outcome of the election if he lost. Democrats called him a sore loser. \u201cWe were up considerably in all but two of the battleground states where we were tied or one behind, according to our data,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe were tied in Arizona. We just had a real wind at our back,\u201d before the first, stunning letter from Comey. Clinton's campaign insisted the reopened inquiry would turn up nothing, and many Democrats accused Comey of partisan motives. He was once a registered Republican. Comey has not commented publicly on either letter. His defenders have said there was no partisan intent and that he should not be blamed for Clinton\u2019s loss to an opponent who ultimately had a deeper well of support among voters. Clinton did not accuse Comey of partisanship Saturday. But she did say that what should have been good news essentially backfired. Comey issued another letter to Congress on the Sunday before Election Day, concluding that the nine-day examination of newly discovered emails had turned up nothing to change his earlier conclusion that there had been no criminal conduct. \u201cJust as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would \u2014 saying there was no there there \u2014 was a real motivator for Trump\u2019s voters,\u201d Clinton said. A day earlier, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri had told the same group of donors something similar \u2014 that the news angered Trump voters and caused a spike in turnout, while Clinton's projected turnout fell. \u201cTrump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,\u201d Clinton said. [ Signs of trouble on Clinton's last day on the trail ] The Democrat focused on the outside events she said affected her campaign in the last three weeks of the election. She said nothing about other, larger forces at work \u2014 Trump's message of change in a restive time, his pledge to represent the aggrieved working class, the difficulty of any political party winning a third consecutive presidential term, her own limited attention to economic anxiety or the sexism and discomfort that surrounded her attempt to become the first female president. 1 of 57 ",

Trump replied with this: \u201cI\u2019m going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I\u2019m going to be very restrained.\u201d \u201cI find it tremendous,\u201d he said of the social media platform, which he credited for winning the White House race. \u201cIt\u2019s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing we should be ashamed of.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump describes \"gracious\" congratulatory conversations with Hillary and Bill Clinton. Trump, who now has over 14 million Twitter followers, added: \u201cIt\u2019s where it\u2019s at...I do believe this, I really believe that the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera -- I think it helped me win all of these races where they\u2019re spending much more money than I spent.\u201d He dismissed his opponents\u2019 use of their campaign cash to advertise in more traditional ways, saying that \u201csocial media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.\u201d Trump, who estimates that 28 million people follow him on his Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, also touted the benefits of social media as an effective tool to fight back against news outlets. \u201cIt\u2019s a great form of communication. Now do I say I\u2019ll give it up entirely?\u201d he told Stahl. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another -- a network, or whatever, \u2018cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right?

    "text": "Four Americans Killed in Afghanistan During Veteran\u2019s Day Run By James Gordon Meek Nov 12, 2016, 7:45 PM ET 0 Shares Email Four Americans were killed and 17 troops and contractors were wounded while participating in a Veterans Day 5K run when an apparent lone attacker managed to detonate a deadly bomb inside the sprawling Bagram military base in Afghanistan yesterday, counterterrorism officials told ABC News today. The U.S. military's Operation Resolute Support provided few details beyond confirming that a blast inside the base had left two U.S. service members and two American contractors dead along with 16 American troops and a Polish trooper wounded.\u00a0 Bagram Airfield is home to nearly 14,000 military forces and contractors. But officials in Washington and various U.S. military commands have been told that the victims were participating in a 5K run celebrating Veterans Day, two counterterrorism officials told ABC News. As part of standard operating procedure, outside communications at the base are temporarily shut off after deadly attacks. The Afghan Taliban claimed responsibility in a statement today, claiming much higher casualties. \"I am deeply saddened to learn that an explosion early this morning at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan has resulted in U.S. casualties. An apparent suicide bomber has taken the lives of two U.S. service members and two U.S. contractors working on the base,\"\u00a0Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in a statement today. \"For those who carried out this attack, my message is simple. We will not be deterred in our mission to protect our homeland and help Afghanistan secure its own future,\" Carter said.\u00a0 \"To the family and friends of those who lost their lives today, we share your loss and our thoughts are with you. We offer you our deepest condolences. For the family and\u00a0friends of those wounded in today\u2019s attack, let me assure you they are receiving the\u00a0best care possible, and we will keep them in our\u00a0thoughts today,\u201d said Army General John W.\u00a0Nicholson, Commander of Resolute Support. \"To those who target Coalition forces, ANDSF, and Afghan civilians, Resolute Support and USFOR-A will continue to pursue our Train, Advise, and Assist mission to help our partners create a better Afghanistan.\u201d The deadly bombing appears to be unprecedented in the 15-year Afghan War. Past attacks on various gates and checkpoints at Bagram, an hour's drive north of the capital Kabul, have never succeeded in penetrating the many layers of security. In 2007, a suicide bomber killed 22 civilians and Army Pfc. Daniel Zizumbo during a coincidental visit by then-Vice President Richard Cheney. After a stop by President Obama to visit with troops at Bagram Airfield in early 2013, the Taliban lobbed mortars at the base.\u00a0 In both cases, the Afghan Taliban claimed falsely that Cheney and Obama had been the targets, which American officials denied. The most serious breach of security at Bagram known to have occurred was in July 2005 when four senior al-Qaeda operatives succeeded in escaping a prison located on the flight line. 0 Shares ",

At one point, crowds marched onto and blocked Interstate 395. (Nov. 11) AP Demonstrators hold up signs during a protest against the election of President-elect Donald Trump on 5th Ave near Trump Tower on Nov. 12, 2016. (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) About 2,000 demonstrators marched down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan on Saturday in\u00a0a fourth\u00a0day of anti-Donald Trump protests nationwide. Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., also saw continued\u00a0demonstrations that have swept the country since Tuesday's election. While most protests have been peaceful, there have been some\u00a0spurts of violence and at least one shooting. A gunman firing first into the air then at a protester injured one man, apparently shot in the leg, during a confrontation Friday night and early Saturday on a bridge over the Willamette River in Portland. The\u00a0victim was taken to a hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries as police sought a\u00a0male suspect, who apparently fled in his vehicle. Anti-Trump protestors gather at City Hall in downtown Portland to voice their opinion following the U.S. elections on Nov.11, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Ankur Dholakia, AFP/Getty Images) The latest round of protests on Saturday developed in New York, where demonstrators rallied first at Union Square then pushed into the street in a march toward Trump Tower, where the president-elect lives. Fifth Avenue was crowded for blocks with about\u00a02,000 protesters\u00a0in a peaceful demonstration as police\u00a0lined both sides of the street and followed\u00a0along on foot and on motorcycle. In Chicago, hundreds of people including families with small children chanted \u201cNo hate. No fear. Immigrants are welcome here\u201d as they marched Saturday through Millennium Park, a popular downtown tourist attraction. Yoga teacher Sonja Spray, 29, said\u00a0she heard about the Saturday morning demonstration on Facebook and decided to join the protest over Trump's\u00a0election, the Associated Press reports. She carried a sign reading, \u201cWOMEN are NO JOKE.\" In Portland, demonstrations\u00a0began as a peaceful rally at City Hall on Friday afternoon only to be stopped by police after protesters reportedly split into groups and vandalized parts of the city. Through the night, flash bangs and tear gas were used to disperse protesters.\u00a0Police advised the crowd that their gathering was considered an unlawful assembly and they were subject to arrest. The shooting on Portland's Morrison bridge broke out following\u00a0a confrontation between a man in a vehicle and a demonstrator, police said.\u00a0It wasn't clear whether the dispute stemmed from\u00a0politics. \"The suspect got out of the vehicle and fired multiple shots injuring the victim,\" police said in a statement .\u00a0The victim, according to one witness, was shot in the leg, Oregonlive.com reports. On Twitter, police said the\u00a0suspect is described as African-American male in his\u00a0late teens, wearing a dark hoodie and saggy blue jeans. Protesters march on their way to Waterfront Park in Portland, Ore., on the third day of protests over the results of the presidential election Nov. 10, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Jim Ryan, AP) The\u00a0chants at the protests in recent days have become familiar: \"Love Trumps Hate,\" \"Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,\" and still others buoyed by expletives. The protesters say they are aware their words and actions cannot reverse Tuesday's decision, but many said they want to raise awareness about their opposition to a campaign that included revelations about disparaging remarks Trump made regarding women and threats to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to keep immigrants out. In Manhattan, Leslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Connecticut, said she was joining her first protest since the anti-war marches of the 1970s. She described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be armchair anymore.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country where my friends aren\u2019t included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that\u2019s frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential. So I\u2019m here for them,\u201d she said, according to the Associated Press. In Los Angeles, about 150 protesters were arrested after they failed to disperse at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday, said Officer Aareon\u00a0Jefferson. It was close to the same number that had been arrested the previous night for another demonstration. The 1,000 protesters marched through the city\u2019s downtown streets, chanting and carrying signs, followed by a large group of police.\u00a0They disrupted traffic, but no other major issues were reported. \u00a0Demonstrations are expected to continue Saturday as protesters are planning to march from MacArthur Park, west of downtown, an area of older apartment buildings that is\u00a0home to many Latinos. x Share Spurred by fear and outrage, protesters around the country rallied and marched Friday as they have done daily since Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory. (Nov. 11) AP Trump said via Twitter on Thursday that the protests are being fueled by the media, and he called them \"unfair\" \u2014 but he backpedaled Friday morning, tweeting that he loves that \"the small groups of protesters ... have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!\" Anti-Trump protests, some violent, erupt for 3rd night nationwide In Miami, hundreds of young people packed into Bayfront Park shouting\u00a0\"Not My President\" and \"Black Lives Matter\" as they bounced signs above their heads reading \"Hate Ain't Great\" and \"You're Fired,\" a reference to Trump's reality TV show The Apprentice. The crowd, numbering into the thousands, also blocked both lanes of Interstate 395 for about half an hour before proceeding downtown. x Share Pictures of people wearing safety pins are popping up on social media as a way to protest Donald Trump. USA TODAY NETWORK In Burlington, Vt., about 200 people gathered in City Hall Park, heeding a call issued via Facebook by University of Vermont sophomore Emily Flaherty. The 20-year-old said it was the first time she'd done anything like this. \"The election of a man who has bragged about sexually assaulting women, called them pig and dogs, who is unapologetic about his conduct, makes me feel unsafe and sick,\" Flaherty said. Former Vermont state legislator Judy Rosenstreich encouraged those in the crowd to use their emotions to propel them into politics and public service. \"Regardless of the fact that Trump was elected, we're not going to compromise a single advancement we have made,\" Rosenstreich, a Democrat, told the crowd. Share In a series of tweets, the conservative pundit mocks anti-Trump protesters' weight. USA TODAY NETWORK In Iowa City, Iowa, hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown and shut down Interstate 80. Earlier Friday, about 200 students walked out of classes at City High School, marching into downtown. Armani Smith, a 17-year-old senior, said he helped stage the walkout that included a march through streets packed with traffic. \"After the election, a lot of people at City High were down, crying, very sad \u2014 a\u00a0lot of teachers were crying,\" Smith said.\u00a0\"Basically who I'm looking to is Martin Luther King. He taught me a lot of things when I was young, that peaceful protest can accomplish some change in society.\" Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

John Minchillo/AP hide caption toggle caption John Minchillo/AP Ray Tensing, seen here leaving court Friday, was charged with murder after shooting Sam DuBose during a routine traffic stop in July of 2015. John Minchillo/AP The jury in the case of former University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing, who shot and killed an unarmed man in July of 2015, says it can't reach a unanimous verdict on murder and manslaughter charges. Tensing had initially stopped Sam DuBose for a missing front license plate; moments later, he shot him at point-blank range. Judge Megan Shanahan declared a mistrial Saturday morning, accepting the jury's deadlock status several days after deliberations began. She had previously encouraged the jury to work toward a verdict, suggesting there was enough evidence to decide the case. Body-cam footage of the shooting created an uproar after it showed that Tensing, who is white, engaged in a brief struggle with DuBose before firing his pistol into the car. Seconds before, the two had been discussing whether DuBose had a license, and whether he should take off his seatbelt. When he announced that Tensing had been indicted for murder less than two weeks after the fatal traffic stop, Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters called the officer's actions \"asinine\" and \"totally unwarranted.\" Article continues after sponsorship As NPR member station WVXU reported last summer: \"There were reports that the 25-year-old Tensing shot DuBose while being dragged by DuBose's car. Deters said the body cam video \u2013 which the prosecutor released to the public Wednesday afternoon \u2013 showed that the officer was not dragged by the car.\" Deters said, \"I've been doing this for over 30 years. This is the most asinine act I've ever seen a police officer make.\" Jurors in the case had begun their deliberations Wednesday \u2014 but they had made several requests for transcripts and advice. Tensing was facing possible punishment of up to life in prison on the murder charge and a maximum 11-year sentence on the manslaughter charge. On Friday, the third day of deliberations, WVXU detailed one of the final exchanges between Shanahan and the jury: \"Shortly after 5, jurors asked more questions, including what were the definitions of under arrest and resisting arrest. \"Judge Shanahan told jurors they had 'all the instructions you need to reach a verdict in this case. It would be improper for the court to elaborate further,' and sent them back to deliberations.\" ",

    "text": "CBS/AP November 12, 2016, 7:45 AM Donald Trump protester shot during Oregon demonstration Email Last Updated Nov 12, 2016 9:19 AM EST PORTLAND, Ore. -- As protests of President-elect Donald Trump entered another day, police in Portland, Oregon, say one person was shot and injured by a man who had gotten into a confrontation with a protester and then opened fire. President-elect Donald Trump says he will not throw out all parts of the Affordable Care Act he said he would do away with before the election.  ... Portland police said the victim was taken to a hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries and they were looking for a male suspect, who got out of a vehicle and fired multiple shots early Saturday morning on a Willamette River bridge before fleeing in the vehicle. The shooting followed rowdy Friday night protests, when police used tear gas in response to \u201cburning projectiles\u201d thrown at officers, police said on Twitter. Hundreds of people marched through the city, disrupting traffic and spray-painting graffiti. A demonstrator is treated for a gunshot wound during a protest against the election of Republican Donald Trump as president of the United States in Portland, Oregon, Nov. 12, 2016. Reuters/Cole Howard Authorities reported instances of vandalism and assault during a rally that organizers had billed as peaceful earlier in the day. President-elect Donald Trump describes \"gracious\" congratulatory conversations with Hillary and Bill Clinton. Anger over the election has had some violent and ugly results, CBS News correspondent Marlie Hall reports. A video posted to social media shows David Wilcox, a white Trump supporter, being beaten by a group of African-Americans following a traffic dispute in Chicago. \u201cSomebody yelled, \u2018That\u2019s one of them white boy Trump supporters,\u2019 and then I said, \u2018What does that have to do with this? We\u2019re talking about insurance here,\u2019\u201d Wilcox told CBS station WBBM-TV. \u201cAnd I asked the lady, \u2018Ma\u2019am, do you have insurance?\u2019 and immediately punches were thrown. They didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d Protests against President-elect Donald Trump have been going on for three nights in a number of cities around the country. Anna Werner reports f... But the coarseness goes both ways. Chants of \u201cwhite power\u201d were heard from students holding a Trump-Pence campaign sign at a school in York, Pennsylvania. And middle schoolers in Michigan chanted \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d leaving Latino students in tears. Reaction from the school district was swift. \u201cThis is not who we are,\u201d said Principal Todd Noonan. \u201cEveryone is welcome in our community of learners. We build bridges. We work together.\u201d In other parts of the country, spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets have taken place since Wednesday. Hundreds joined a Friday afternoon \u201clove rally\u201d in Washington Square Park in Manhattan. Leslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, took an hour-long train ride to the demonstration - her first protest since the 1970s, when she hit the streets of San Francisco to oppose the Vietnam War. Donald Trump will stay in New York Saturday to continue to work on his White House transition. The president-elect's evolving stance on Obamacare... She described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be armchair anymore.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country where my friends aren\u2019t included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that\u2019s frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential, so I\u2019m here for them,\u201d she said. Evening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta. Washington Post political columnist Philip Bump joins \"CBS This Morning: Saturday\" to discuss contenders for Donald Trump's Cabinet, the presiden... Trump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami. His car was among hundreds stopped when protesters blocked Interstate 395. \u201cTrump will be our president. There is no way around that, and the sooner people grasp that, the better off we will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a difference between a peaceful protest and standing in a major highway backing up traffic for 5 miles. This is wrong.\u201d More than a thousand protesters took to the streets across California after night fell including downtown Los Angeles, where over 200 were arrested a night earlier. In Bakersfield, where Trump is far more popular than in most of the state, some held signs reading \u201cAnti-Trump, Pro-USA.\u201d Donald Trump's pledge to renegotiate or withdraw from international trade deals and pressuring U.S. companies to bring jobs home resonated with A... Small protests also were held in Detroit; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Olympia, Washington and Iowa City. More than 200 people carrying signs gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted \u201cnot my president\u201d and \u201cno Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\u201d In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. A protest also occurred in Minneapolis. In Chicago, multiple groups planned protests through Saturday. Nadia Gavino, 25, learned about the rallies on Twitter and protested Thursday evening. Gavino, whose father is from Peru and whose mother is of Mexican and Lithuanian heritage, said she took Trump\u2019s harshest statements about immigrants and Latinos personally. \u201cI obviously agree that he\u2019s racist, he\u2019s sexist, he\u2019s phobic, he\u2019s misogynistic. He\u2019s all these things you don\u2019t want in a leader,\u201d she said. Ashley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver. \u201cI have a leader I fear for the first time in my life,\u201d said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re sore losers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.\u201d Demonstrations also were planned Saturday in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other areas. Previous demonstrations drew thousands of people in New York and other large urban centers. The largely peaceful demonstrations were overshadowed by sporadic episodes of vandalism, violence and street-blocking. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Nov 12 2016, 2:58 pm ET Viral Photos of Drug Overdose Victims Expose Pitfalls in Fighting Addiction by Jon Schuppe advertisement The images are both repellent and captivating: men and women, often with children in their care, passed out from drug overdoses in near-death moments captured just after cops arrive at the scene. In another era, they might have only appeared in tabloid newspapers, like the work of street photographer Weegee . Instead, they catch fire first on social media, rocketing across the internet and turning what would have been an anonymous, small-town tragedy into a public spectacle. Related: What Happens When a Drug Overdose Photo Goes Viral Police chiefs who've distributed the photos in recent months \u2014 in Ohio, Massachusetts and Indiana \u2014 say they had no intention of making the images go viral. Their sole goal, they say, was to get residents of their own communities to recognize that they were not immune from America's opioid epidemic. But the photos have opened a new front in the drug battle, with addiction experts and some criminal justice researchers saying the photos violate people's privacy and fuel the shame and stigma that keeps addicts from seeking help \u2014 and push the problem into the shadows. Police in East Liverpool, Ohio released an image of a couple overdosed in the front seat with their son in the back seat of their car. Liverpool, Ohio Police Department \"That person is not volunteering to be the spokesperson,\" said Levele Pointer, a recovering heroin addict from New York who counsels addicts and policymakers on ways to curb drug use by treating it as a medical problem, rather than one that requires punishment. \"You're throwing that person out there and may cause more harm than good.\" The distribution of the photos, Pointer said, reflects and perpetuates misunderstandings of how addiction works. Related: Education or Humiliation? What Happens When a Drug Overdose Photo Goes Viral \"I'm not aware of anyone who says, 'I want to be a drug addict,'\" Pointer said. \"This is not a conscious choice that anyone has made. It's something that has happened and they're trying to get over it. The addiction sometimes creeps up on us, and we're not in control in that moment. It's like having an out-of-body experience. The whole time you're feeling total regret.\" That, he said, helps to explain what to many seems unforgivable: people getting high around children. \"Sometimes, there's nowhere else to take the kid, so they try to do it in the safest place,\" Pointer said.

But she said there are more effective ways to do it: collecting and sharing data on overdose deaths, and finding addicts and families willing to talk publicly about their ordeals. \"It facilitates a conversation that can lead to opportunities to create policies that would positively impact the issue,\" LaSalle said. \"That includes interventions that have evidence behind them and can save lives.\" Play Pizzeria Workers Save Couple From Heroin Overdose 1:25 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161113023635if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/780636739629\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, said the departments that distribute overdose photos \"are coming from the right place, and have good intentions, and are trying to get people to understand how serious this is.\" Such a tactic can be \"a good way to reach people who don't believe that's something to care about in their community,\" he added. But police must also anticipate how the community might react to the photos, Bueermann said. If there is a relative lack of sensitivity among locals, then police risk fueling backlashes against the overdose victims, in which people call for them to go to jail and for their children to be taken away from them. \"You can show people a photo and make them believe it's a problem in their community, but it needs to be paired with a message of what you're trying to achieve,\" Bueermann said. Reynoldsburg police shared a photo after they found an unconscious male behind the wheel. The responding officers observed fresh syringe marks on the male's arm and noticed that he was snoring and sweating profusely. Reynoldsburg Division Of Police Jim O'Neill, the police chief of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said his message in releasing such photos is clear: \"We want to raise awareness and make sure people understand that this kind of thing is around.\" Last week, his department posted a picture on Facebook of a man passed out at the wheel of a car. Some praised the move, while others accused the police of using shaming tactics. O'Neill said he stands by the move, and believes it served its purpose. Police gave a similar explanation in Hope, Indiana, after they distributed a picture in late October of a young woman passed out in a car with her 10-month-old son in the back. Her mother said she received hate messages . The police chief said he was surprised by the backlash, but did not regret the photo. Police released an image of Erika Hurt unconscious at the wheel of a car with a needle in her hand on Oct. 22. This image has been digitally manipulated to obscure her face. Hope Police Department A month earlier, police in East Liverpool, Ohio, posted on Facebook photos of a woman and her friend unconscious in a car with her 4-year-old grandson in the back. The story went viral, and the woman's sister accused police of humiliating her and the boy . A city official was unapologetic, saying the public needed to see the damage heroin does to families. Also in September, police in Lawrence, Massachusetts, gave the media copies of video showing a mother passed out in a Family Dollar store while her young daughter tried to wake her. The police chief told a local NBC affiliate that the footage was \"evidence that shows what addiction can do to someone.\" The woman later came forward to explain her battle with addiction, her struggle to get treatment, and the unwanted publicity and shame the video had caused.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Anti-Donald Trump protesters march in the street on Fifth Avenue in New York City Friday, in another night of protests over the president-elect. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Friday night brought more protests against Donald Trump's White House win, with marchers taking to the streets in cities from Miami and Atlanta to San Francisco. In Portland, Ore., police say a man was shot on a bridge by a suspect who then fled. Most of Friday's demonstrations in cities that included Iowa City and Nashville were peaceful, despite disruptions to traffic. But in Portland, where police say Thursday's protest morphed into a riot , things turned violent for a second night. The shooting took place during a protest march on the Morrison Bridge, where officials say that the suspect, who was in a vehicle, had a confrontation with the protester that ended with multiple gunshots and the suspect jumping back in a car to flee the scene. YouTube \"Officers near the scene arrived quickly and provided medical aid until an ambulance arrived to transport the victim to a Portland hospital for treatment to non-life-threatening injuries,\" the Portland Police Bureau says. Portland's protesters began last night with \"an apology for all the damage that was done\" this week, reporter Kristian FodenVencil of Oregon Public Broadcasting tells our Newscast unit. Article continues after sponsorship \"A lot of people didn't want to see that \u2014 in fact, there were fights during the protest,\" he says, between protesters who were trying to stop others from smashing car windows and other items. Other protesters simply tried to clean up after the group \u2014 and thousands of dollars have been raised, FodenVencil says, by a Go Fund Me page that's meant to help pay for some of the damages. In Miami, protesters blocked the MacArthur Causeway, the six-lane highway that runs between the city's downtown area and Miami Beach. One of the Miami protest's organizers, Megan Shade, tells member station WLRN , \"A lot of people are here for different reasons. People are angry, and so what I want this to be is for us to release that anger and for us to be able to move to a progressive movement.\" In Austin, demonstrators installed themselves around the Nueces Mosque, in a show of support and an offer of protection, according to local TV Spectrum news .

Trump is campaigning throughout South Carolina ahead of the state's primary. (Aaron P. Bernstein / Getty Images) Jose A. DelRealThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump and key advisers in recent days have backed away from some of the most sweeping pledges that the Republican candidate made on the campaign trail, suggesting that his administration may not deliver on promises that were important to his most fervent supporters. Trump built his campaign message around bold vows to, among other things, force Mexico to pay for a massive border wall, fully repeal the Affordable Care Act and ban Muslims from entering the United States. But in the days since his upset election victory, he or his advisers have suggested that those proposals and others may be subject to revision. On President Barack Obama 's health-care law, for example, Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal Friday that he would like to keep some parts of the law intact and may seek to amend the statute rather than repeal it. Trump said he came to the conclusion after Obama, during Trump's Oval Office meeting Thursday, suggested areas of the law that should be preserved. Trump suggested provisions that prevent insurers from refusing coverage for preexisting conditions and which allow children to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26 should stay. \"I like those very much,\" he said. The chant echoed through Donald Trump 's boisterous rallies leading up to Election Day: \"Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!\" \"We are fighting for every citizen that believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests,\" the billionaire real... The chant echoed through Donald Trump 's boisterous rallies leading up to Election Day: \"Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!\" \"We are fighting for every citizen that believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests,\" the billionaire real... (Matea Gold, Tom Hamburger) In the same interview, Trump also avoided answering whether he would follow through on a campaign vow to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server while secretary of state. \"It's not something I've given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform,\" he said. That ambivalent tone is a far cry from Trump's sweeping rhetoric on the campaign trail, where he repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace the ACA and led crowds in chants of \"Lock her up!\" in reference to Clinton. His lack of clarity on these and other issues has added more uncertainty to an already chaotic presidential transition, as he scrambles to build a team. There is also no guarantee that Trump will not return to his previous positions. In August, he appeared to consider softening his proposal to deport millions of illegal immigrants en masse, only to give a rousing speech retaining his hard-line stance. With little clarity from Trump himself, some of his surrogates and advisers have given a mixed view of what Trump will hope to accomplish in his first 100 days in office, discounting some of his most well-known proposals.

(Ethan Miller / Getty Images) Former House speaker Newt Gingrich , a Trump adviser, cast doubt this week on whether the new president would seek to have Mexico fund Trump's proposed border wall - a pledge that inspired regular chants of \"Build that wall!\" during campaign rallies. \"He'll spend a lot of time controlling the border. He may not spend very much time trying to get Mexico to pay for it, but it was a great campaign device,\" Gingrich said Thursday during a conference call sponsored by Dentons, a global law firm. Former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a close adviser to Trump, sounded certain that the wall would be built - but was far from clear about the timeline. He said during an interview on CNN Thursday that he believes Trump should prioritize tax reform in his first 100 days rather than issues like building the border wall. \"The wall is going to take a while,\" Giuliani said. \"Absolutely he's going to build it; it's a campaign promise. He's not going to break a campaign promise.\" On deportations, the campaign has yet to detail how many undocumented immigrants might be targeted for immediate removal by the Trump administration. The number could range anywhere from 1 million to 6 million, according to various priorities Trump outlined over time throughout the campaign. During the GOP primaries, he repeatedly said that all of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants would have to leave. ",

Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller says the crowd of about 500 protesters dispersed early Saturday afternoon after linking arms to block the entrance. No one was arrested, and workers had been evacuated. Earlier Saturday, Keller says a caravan of about 150 cars left the protest camps and arrived in Mandan, where protesters stood and blocked the intersection of Highway 6 and Main Street. The caravan then headed west to the work yard where construction equipment is kept. The four-state, 1,200-mile pipeline is complete except for under the Missouri River in North Dakota. Protesters fear the pipeline could affect water supply and disturb tribal cultural sites. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Photo Myron Ebell Credit The Competitive Enterprise Institute The mug-shot posters, pasted on walls and lampposts around Paris by an activist group during the United Nations climate talks last year, were hardly flattering. They depicted Myron Ebell, a climate contrarian, as one of seven \u201cclimate criminals\u201d wanted for \u201cdestroying our future.\u201d But in his customary mild-mannered way, Mr. Ebell, who directs environmental and energy policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a libertarian advocacy group in Washington, brushed it off. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to this over the years,\u201d he told an interviewer at the talks. \u201cBut I did go out and get my photo taken with my poster, just so I have it as a memento.\u201d In looking for someone to follow through on his campaign vow to dismantle one of the Obama administration\u2019s signature climate change policies, President-elect Donald J. Trump probably could not have found a better candidate for the job than Mr. Ebell. Mr. Ebell, who revels in taking on the scientific consensus on global warming, will be Mr. Trump\u2019s lead agent in choosing personnel and setting the direction of the federal agencies that address climate change and environmental policy more broadly. Mr. Ebell, whose organization is financed in part by the coal industry, has been one of the most vocal opponents of the linchpin of that policy, the Clean Power Plan. Developed by the Environmental Protection Agency , the plan is a far-reaching set of regulations that, by seeking to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation, could result in the closing of many coal-burning power plants, among other effects. Mr. Ebell has said that the plan, which has been tied up in the courts since it was finalized in 2015, is illegal. In the interview in Paris last year, he said he hoped whoever was elected president would \u201cundo the E.P.A. power plant regs and some of the other regs that are very harmful to our economy.\u201d The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet. As the person Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the transition at the E.P.A., Mr. Ebell, 63, will be in a position to begin to do just that. Mr. Ebell, who did not respond to a request for an interview, grew up on a ranch in Oregon. He got his undergraduate degree at Colorado College and master\u2019s at the London School of Economics, where he studied under the conservative political philosopher Michael Oakeshott. He has described himself as \u201csort of a contrarian by nature and upbringing,\u201d and has said he was very strongly influenced by the \u201cquestion authority\u201d ethos of 1960s and \u201970s counterculture Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI really think that people should be suspicious of authority,\u201d he told an interviewer last year. \u201cThe more you\u2019re told that you have to believe something, the more you should question it.\u201d Mr. Ebell leads the Cooler Heads Coalition , a loose-knit group that says it is \u201cfocused on dispelling the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific, and risk analysis.\u201d He has been one of the nation\u2019s most visible climate contrarians, known for dispensing memorable sound bites on cable news shows and at events like the annual conferences sponsored by the Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based group that rejects the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. More Reporting on Climate Change Mr. Ebell has said that \u201ca lot of third-, fourth- and fifth-rate scientists have gotten a long ways\u201d by embracing climate change. He frequently mocks climate leaders like Al Gore, and has called the movement the \u201cforces of darkness\u201d because \u201cthey want to turn off the lights all over the world.\u201d No one, it seems, is immune to his criticism. He called Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical on climate change, issued in mid-2015, \u201cscientifically ill informed, economically illiterate, intellectually incoherent and morally obtuse.\u201d \u201cIt is also theologically suspect, and large parts of it are leftist drivel,\u201d he added. Mr. Ebell cut his teeth in Washington working for Frontiers of Freedom , a research group founded by former Senator Malcolm Wallop, a Wyoming Republican, to advocate for limited government. He also worked for a Republican congressman from Arizona, John Shadegg, on an effort to revamp the Endangered Species Act to make it more respectful of property rights. In interviews and speeches, Mr. Ebell comes off as amiable and calm. But he is hardly shy about lobbing verbal grenades, sometimes directly at scientists and environmentalists.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo Throughout the election, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief, has defended his company as a place where people can share all opinions. Credit Lluis Gene/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Late on Tuesday night, as it became clear that Donald J. Trump would defeat Hillary Clinton to win the presidential election, a private chat sprang up on Facebook among several vice presidents and executives of the social network. What role, they asked each other, had their company played in the election\u2019s outcome? Facebook\u2019s top executives concluded that they should address the issue and assuage staff concerns at a quarterly all-hands meeting. They also called a smaller meeting with the company\u2019s policy team, according to three people who saw the private chat and are familiar with the decisions; they requested anonymity because the discussion was confidential. Facebook has been in the eye of a postelection storm for the last few days, embroiled in accusations that it helped spread misinformation and fake news stories that influenced how the American electorate voted. The online conversation among Facebook\u2019s executives on Tuesday, which was one of several private message threads that began among the company\u2019s top ranks, showed that the social network was internally questioning what its responsibilities might be. Even as Facebook has outwardly defended itself as a nonpartisan information source \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg said at a conference on Thursday that Facebook affecting the election was \u201ca pretty crazy idea\u201d \u2014 many company executives and employees have been asking one another if, or how, they shaped the minds, opinions and votes of Americans. Some employees are worried about the spread of racist and so-called alt-right memes across the network, according to interviews with 10 current and former Facebook employees. Others are asking whether they contributed to a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d among users who largely interact with people who share the same beliefs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even more are reassessing Facebook\u2019s role as a media company and wondering how to stop the distribution of false information. Some employees have been galvanized to send suggestions to product managers on how to improve Facebook\u2019s powerful news feed: the streams of status updates, articles, photos and videos that users typically spend the most time interacting with. \u201cA fake story claiming Pope Francis \u2014 actually a refugee advocate \u2014 endorsed Mr. Trump was shared almost a million times, likely visible to tens of millions,\u201d Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies the social impact of technology, said of a recent post on Facebook . \u201cIts correction was barely heard. Of course Facebook had significant influence in this last election\u2019s outcome.\u201d This image of Facebook as a partisan influencer and distributor of bad information is at odds with how the company views itself, former and current employees said. Chris Cox, a senior vice president of product and one of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s top lieutenants, has long described Facebook as an unbiased and blank canvas to give people a voice. Employees and executives genuinely believed they were well-intentioned and acting as a force for good, these people said. Facebook declined to comment beyond a previously released statement that it was \u201cjust one of many ways people received their information \u2014 and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.\u201d The postelection questioning caps a turbulent year for Facebook, during which its power to influence what its 1.79 billion users watch, read and believe has increasingly been criticized. Almost half of American adults rely on Facebook as a source of news, according to a study by the Pew Research Center. And Facebook often emphasizes its ability to sway its users with advertisers, portraying itself as an effective mechanism to help promote their products. Inside Facebook, employees have become more aware of the company\u2019s role in media after several incidents involving content the social network displayed in users\u2019 news feeds. In May, the company grappled with accusations that politically biased employees were censoring some conservative stories and websites in Facebook\u2019s Trending Topics section, a part of the site that shows the most talked-about stories and issues on Facebook. Facebook later laid off the Trending Topics team. In September, Facebook came under fire for removing a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of a naked 9-year-old girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, as she fled napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. The social network took down the photo for violating its nudity standards, even though the picture was an illustration of the horrors of war rather than child pornography. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Both those incidents seemed to worsen a problem of fake news circulating on Facebook. The Trending Topics episode paralyzed Facebook\u2019s willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity, employees said. The \u201cnapalm girl\u201d incident reminded many insiders at Facebook of the company\u2019s often tone-deaf approach to nuanced situations. Throughout, Mr. Zuckerberg has defended Facebook as a place where people can share all opinions. When employees objected in October to the stance of Peter Thiel, a Facebook board member, in supporting Mr. Trump, Mr. Zuckerberg said, \u201c We care deeply about diversity \u201d and reiterated that the social network gave everyone the power to share their experiences. More recently, issues with fake news on the site have mushroomed. Multiple Facebook employees were particularly disturbed last week when a fake news site called The Denver Guardian spread across the social network with negative and false messages about Mrs. Clinton, including a claim that an F.B.I. agent connected to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email disclosures had murdered his wife and shot himself. On Thursday, after a companywide meeting at Facebook, many employees said they were dissatisfied with an address from Mr. Zuckerberg, who offered comments to staff that were similar to what he has said publicly. Even in private, Mr. Zuckerberg has continued to resist the notion that Facebook can unduly affect how people think and behave. In a Facebook post circulated on Wednesday to a small group of his friends, which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Zuckerberg challenged the idea that Facebook had a direct effect on the way people voted. In the three-paragraph post, the chief executive cited several statistics about low voter turnout during the election. Then Mr. Zuckerberg wrote: \u201cSo rather than focusing on strengths or weaknesses in specific demographics, or other factors that may have pushed this race in one direction or another, these stats clearly suggest what many people have said all along. Both candidates were very unpopular.\u201d ",

Tens, and possibly hundreds, of thousands of South Koreans were expected to rally in Seoul on Saturday demanding the ouster of Park in what would be one of the biggest protests in the country since its democratization about 30 years ago. The signs read \"Park Geun-hye should step down.\" (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) 0 Shares Email Hundreds of thousands of people flooded Seoul's streets on Saturday demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye amid an explosive political scandal, in what may be South Korea's largest protest since it shook off dictatorship three decades ago. Police said about 260,000 people turned out for the latest mass rally against Park, whose presidency has been shaken by suspicion that she let a shadowy longtime confidante manipulate power from behind the scenes. Protest organizers estimated the crowd at 1 million. Waving banners and signs, a sea of demonstrators jammed streets stretching about a kilometer (half a mile) from City Hall to a large square in front of an old palace gate for several hours, roaring and applauding to speeches calling for Park's ouster. Protesters also marched on a road in front of the palace gate and near the Blue House, the mountainside presidential office and residence, carrying candles, blowing horns and banging drums, while shouting \"Park Geun-hye, resign!\" Bae Dong-san, a 45-year-old man, said Park's government has \"worsened the living conditions of workers, completely messed up state governance and monopolized state affairs with her secret inner circle.\" \"It feels much better to shout together with many other people,\" he said. Despite rising public anger, opposition parties have yet to seriously push for Park's resignation or impeachment over fears of triggering a backlash from conservative voters and negatively impacting next year's presidential election . However, they have threatened to campaign for Park's resignation if she doesn't distance herself from state affairs. The protest on Saturday was the largest in the capital since June 10, 2008, when police said 80,000 people took part in a candlelight vigil denouncing the government's decision to resume U.S. beef imports amid mad cow fears. Organizers estimated that crowd at 700,000. In the summer of 1987, millions rallied in Seoul and other cities for weeks before the then-military government caved in to demands for free presidential elections. Train and express bus tickets to Seoul were difficult to get from some areas Friday evening and Saturday morning, with the protest reportedly drawing tens of thousands of people from other cities. \"I have never been interested in politics and I don't even have a TV at home ... but unbelievable things have been happening and I came out today because I didn't want to feel defeated as a South Korean citizen,\" said Cho Jong-gyu, who took a five-hour bus ride from the small southern island of Geoje to participate in the rally, where he quietly held a cardboard sign calling for Park to resign. Lee Ryeo-hwa, a Seoul resident who brought her three children to the rally, the youngest of them hanging on her front in a baby carrier, said Park had to go because she \"created this mess with her undemocratic leadership style and refusal to communicate.\" \"People said it was a bad idea to bring my kids here, but I want them to remember today ... and learn that democracies are built on participation,\" Lee said. In addition to allegedly manipulating power, the president's confidante, Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a late cult leader who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, is also suspected of exploiting her presidential ties to bully companies into donating tens of millions of dollars to foundations she controlled. In an attempt to stabilize the situation, Park said Tuesday that she would let the opposition-controlled parliament choose her prime minister. But opposition parties say her words are meaningless without specific promises about transferring much of her presidential powers to a new No. 2. Moon Jae-in, a lawmaker from the main opposition Minjoo Party who lost to Park in the 2012 presidential election, has even demanded that Park surrender her authority to command South Korea's military. The opposition is also demanding a separate investigation into the scandal by a special prosecutor. Prosecutors have arrested Choi, one of her key associates and two former presidential aides who allegedly helped Choi interfere with government decisions and amass an illicit fortune at the expense of businesses. On Saturday, prosecutors summoned a senior executive of Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest company, which is under suspicion of spending millions of dollars illicitly financing the equestrian training of Choi's daughter. They had raided the company's headquarters in southern Seoul on Tuesday. On Friday, prosecutors summoned the chairman of POSCO over allegations that Choi and her associates tried to forcibly take over the shares of an advertising company previously owned by the steelmaker. The increasingly strange scandal surrounding Choi has inspired rumors to fly and left her accused of everything from influencing national security decisions to swaying the careers of pop singers to swinging construction deals for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Under South Korea's criminal litigation law, which requires suspects to be either indicted or released within 20 days of their arrest, prosecutors have until Nov. 20 to formally charge Choi. Ahn Jong-beom, Park's former senior secretary for policy coordination, who allegedly pressured companies into donating large funds to two nonprofits Choi controlled, could also be indicted by the end of next week, said a prosecution official, who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. There is also a possibility that prosecutors will eventually investigate Park, who in a televised apology last week said she would accept a direct investigation into her actions. Under South Korean law, the president has immunity from prosecution except in cases of treason, but she can be investigated. Park has 15 months left in her term. If she steps down before the end of it, an election must be held within 60 days. 0 Shares ",

And though they have been bigger in scope than prior protests -- most of which surrounded the 2000 election where the winner was not determined for weeks after the vote -- the demonstrations have largely been confined to cities in states that Hillary Clinton won. \"The nation is highly polarized and even more than it had been in 2000. Differences are greater and, therefore, the stakes are higher, emotions run stronger, and losses felt more deeply,\" said James Campbell, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo in New York. ABC News USA_Post_Election_Protests_v01 Campbell, whose book \"Polarized: Making Sense of a Divided America\" was published this summer, said that the stark differences that were shown in these election results are likely contributing to the fervor. \"We are so polarized that many Americans had not really come into contact with others who have opposite views. Because of this, it becomes unthinkable to those on either side that other side could win the election. This was expressed in the claims about the election being possibly rigged,\" Campbell said. Campbell said other contributing factors include the age of many of the protesters -- and this being their first presidential loss -- and the general trend that \"protests are much more commonplace on the left than on the right.\" The locations of the protests fit with Democratic strongholds, though that comes as little surprise to Georgetown University associate professor Hans Noel. \"In general, Democrats are strong in cities and in areas with larger non-white populations,\" Noel told ABC News. 0 Shares ",

Now that the real Trump is headed to the White House, will Baldwin become a full-time cast member or will the show recast? Baldwin has proven himself an \"SNL\" staple, having appeared on the show more than some cast members \u2014 around 30 times, including a record 16 times as host \u2014 before his current run as Trump. Ben & Jerry's even named an ice cream flavor \"Schweddy Balls\" in honor of one of his most popular sketches. Play Will Alec Baldwin continue his Donald Trump impersonation on 'SNL'? 0:49 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161113023528if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/804659779636\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> But playing Trump was never meant to be a permanent gig. Baldwin has said that \"SNL\" creator Lorne Michaels had to convince him to take on the role of Trump at the suggestion of his former \"30 Rock\" co-star Tina Fey. \"When I was approached by Lorne, who is a friend of mine, to do it, my first impulse was 'no,'\" Baldwin said on \"Here's the Thing,\" the WNYC radio show he hosts. \"In order to do that effectively, you need to have some appreciation of the person ... some kernel of appreciation, for which Trump I have none.\" Baldwin's guest on his radio show, R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe, challenged Baldwin, saying entertainment culture helped Trump's rise. \"I blame media completely for it. Including 'Saturday Night Live,' sorry to say it,\" Stipe told Baldwin. Alec Baldwin as Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump and Kate McKinnon as Democratic Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton during the \"Debate Cold Open\" sketch on October 15, 2016. Will Heath/NBC / NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Baldwin did not say whether he agreed with Stipe's criticism, but \"SNL\" has at times been accused of increasing the popularity of certain politicians based on how they are portrayed on the show. Cast member Will Ferrell has said he believed his own portrayal of George W. Bush helped humanize the politician and possibly influenced voters to elect Bush in 2000 and again in 2004. RELATED: How 'Saturday Night Live' Has Shaped Our Politics Ferrell played Bush with almost childlike innocence and a penchant for making up fun new words like \"strategery,\" which was actually embraced by members of the Bush White House who reportedly created a \"Strategery Group.\" The impression was so popular it was turned into a Tony-nominated play and live HBO special called \"You're Welcome America. A Final Night with George W Bush,\" which aired in March 2009, months after Bush had left the White House. But Baldwin's portrayal of Trump is far from friendly and Baldwin himself has been vocal in his opposition to a Trump presidency. Many of the show's cast and writing staff also publicly supported Hillary Clinton at fundraisers and on social media. As for Trump, he railed against Baldwin's portrayal of him and even called for the show's cancellation. \"Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!\" Trump tweeted last month. Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016 On the final live show before the election, Baldwin and Kate McKinnon broke character as Trump and Clinton mid-sketch to reflect on how \"gross\" the presidential race had gotten, opting to take a cathartic run together through Times Square to hug strangers instead. The sketch felt an awful lot like a send off to Baldwin and McKinnon's dynamic duo. At the time, the sketch also seemed most likely a goodbye to Baldwin's regular appearances as the GOP candidate, something Baldwin said he would welcome. \"I hope it's over,\" he said on \"The Brian Lehrer Show\" radio program before the election. \"If he wins, I would imagine there might be some opportunity for (returning), but I want my weekends back so I can go be with my kids.\" Then, Trump's stunning victory caught many people off guard, including Baldwin. \"The billionaire Republican businessman is close to winning the race and world markets are crashing. He's all yours, America. He's all yours,\" Baldwin tweeted as election results came in on Tuesday. Italy survived Berlusconi. \u2014 ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) November 9, 2016 There's no telling if Baldwin will remain the show's go-to Trump, but \u2014 given his track record with the show \u2014 we likely haven't seen the last of him. And if Baldwin's tweets are any indication, viewers may be in for an even more biting Trump if the actor does return to the role. \"Trump must be watched, monitored, critiqued, held accountable, challenged every step of the way. He's earned that,\" Baldwin tweeted on Friday. Reps for \"SNL\" did not respond to a request for comment. The show will air a new episode Saturday with Dave Chappelle making his much-anticipated hosting debut alongside musical guest A Tribe Called Quest. Jillian Sederholm ",

KPRC-TV reported Friday that the woman, who can be heard yelling, even cursing, at the boy who is visibly upset, was interviewed by Fort Bend County\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Office and Child Protective Services after she posted the video on her Facebook page. VIDEO CONTAINS GRAPHIC LANGUAGE \u201cSince you voted for Trump, you can get your s\u2014t and get out,\u201d the woman is heard saying to the boy as she records the video on a cellphone. As of Friday the video had been shared more than 200,000 times, sparking outrage and demands that she be locked up. \u201cUh, uh, the suitcase is packed by the door.\u201d The boy bawls uncontrollably as he\u2019s shown to the door with the suitcase and a handmade sign that says, \u201cMy mom kicked me out because I voted for Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cBye Donald Trump lover,\u201d she is heard saying. Later in the video the boy stands on the sidewalk with the signand tells the camera he voted for Trump because saw him a lot on TV. The station reported that the video, which is nearly five minutes-long, was tough to watch, even tougher to understand. Neighbors who live on the woman\u2019s block in the town of Fresno told the station the video left them angry and appalled. Detective Joe Luera of the Fort Bend Sheriff\u2019s Office told the station that as disturbing as the video is, investigators haven\u2019t found evidence of a crime. He said the investigation was continuing. Luera told another station, KTRK-TV , that he met the family and saw the boy who appeared to be in good health. \u201cShe explains it was a joke,\u201d he told the station. She told the station the same thing on the phone. The station reported that the woman agreed to be interviewed on camera but then changed her mind. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "Donald Trump supporters cheer on Tuesday night at the New York Hilton Midtown. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Donald Trump supporters cheer on Tuesday night at the New York Hilton Midtown. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The dust is starting to settle in Washington and around the country after an election that stunned political watchers and pollsters. Here are seven things we've learned about Donald Trump's path to victory Tuesday night: 1. Hillary Clinton now has a wider popular vote lead than Al Gore in 2000, but the Electoral College picks presidents. As vote continues to be counted, Hillary Clinton has now surpassed Al Gore's 2000 popular vote margin. Clinton's popular-vote lead is 668,171 over President-elect Donald Trump, according to the latest totals compiled by the U.S. Election Atlas. Gore got 547,398 more votes than George W. Bush in 2000. Clinton's lead will only likely grow as votes continue to be finalized. Democrats have now won the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections, but lost the Electoral College in two of them. This takes place as Democrats continue to migrate to cities and the coasts where their population is more concentrated. The constitution mandates the Electoral College picks presidents. The founders created that system in part to avoid the largest states picking \"favorite sons\" and having outsize influence. Article continues after sponsorship 2. Overall turnout will be about the same as 2012. Domenico Montanaro/NPR It may even surpass it when all the vote is counted. These figures represent only about half of all eligible voters in the U.S.. But, as explained below, Clinton earned a lower share than Obama and more voters chose third party candidates. 3. A significant chunk of voters were dissatisfied with their choice of candidates. The number of people electing not to vote for the Republican or Democratic nominee went up by 4.5 million votes, nearly tripling from 2012: Votes for third party or candidates outside the major parties in 2012 vs. 2016. Domenico Montanaro/NPR hide caption toggle caption Domenico Montanaro/NPR It's difficult to say who those voters would have gone to precisely. Libertarian Gary Johnson got more than 4 million votes (or 3 percent), up from 1.3 million in 2012. Green Party candidate Jill Stein got 1.3 million votes in this election, only about 1 percent overall. But more young voters went third party this year: 18-29 YEAR OLDS WHO CHOSE THIRD PARTY/OTHER 2012: 3 percent 4. Clinton did not fire up the Obama Coalition. Clinton got nearly 5 million fewer votes overall than Obama: Domenico Montanaro/NPR Trump, meanwhile, got roughly the same number of voters as Mitt Romney four years ago: Domenico Montanaro/NPR 18-29-YEAR-OLDS Young voters were the same share of the electorate (19 percent), but went in smaller margins for Clinton than Obama and they jumped in third-party support from 3 percent to 8 percent: 2012: 60-37 Obama, 3 percent third party 2016: 55-37 Clinton, 8 percent third party LATINOS By their sheer size, Latinos went up as a share of the electorate from 10 percent to 11 percent, but the idea that they would turn out for Clinton in bigger numbers than Obama because of Trump turned out just not be true overall \u2014 and a significant share, especially among Latinos, went third party: 2012: 71-27 Obama 2016: 65-29 Clinton; 6 percent third party Latinos certainly had an impact in the Southwest, helping Clinton win Nevada and Colorado and even made Arizona and Texas closer than past years. Texas was within 10 points for the first time in 20 years, and Latinos were a quarter of the electorate (24 percent). It might be becoming clear that about 3 in 10 Latinos are simply part of the conservative base. BLACK VOTERS Black voters were down as a share of the electorate slightly and went for Clinton in a smaller margin \u2014 more like 2004 numbers for John Kerry: 2012: 13% of electorate, 93-6 Obama 2016: 12% of electorate, 88-8 Clinton In places like Wayne County, Mich., home to Detroit, and Milwaukee, Wis., Clinton was significantly off from Obama's vote total in 2012. In fact, had she met Obama's vote total, it would have made been more than enough to make up the statewide differences in both states: WISCONSIN STATEWIDE MARGIN: Trump +24,000 votes MILWAUKEE Obama total votes 2012: 332,000 Clinton total votes 2016: 289,000 (-43,000) MICHIGAN STATEWIDE MARGIN: Trump +13,000 votes WAYNE COUNTY Obama total votes 2012: 595,000 Clinton total votes 2016: 517,000 (-78,000) A similar pattern wouldn't have helped Clinton win Pennsylvania. She turned out about 25,000 fewer voters in Philadelphia than Obama, but that discrepancy would not have made up for the crumbling in rural areas and even some counties Obama won. Luzerne (Wilkes-Barre), for example, shifted huge to Trump \u2013 by 25 points. Erie shifted 18 points. In North Carolina, despite Clinton doing better in the Research Triangle area than Obama, black voters, who traditionally turn out at high rates in North Carolina, dropped significantly: BLACK VOTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA 2012: 23% of electorate, 96-4 for Obama 2016: 20% of electorate, 90-8 for Clinton Could they have made up the difference? Quite possibly. Trump won the state by 177,000 votes out of about 4.7 million votes. If black voters were the same share of the electorate as 2012, and Clinton won 90 percent, she would have picked up some 126,000 votes. Now, if they voted in the 96-percent, same margin as they did for Obama and turned out at the same share of the electorate, Clinton would have picked up 191,000 votes. Now almost no one expected, including the Clinton campaign, to get the same margins and share of the electorate with black voters as Obama, so these calculations probably aren't fair. What's more, Trump increased turnout among Republicans, so the black share would have to drop even if the same raw number turned out as 2016. Sure, mathematically, no slippage with black voters, no third-party bleed among young voters in particular and juicing the Latino vote would have meant Clinton could have won despite a white, working-class cratering (more on that below). But that's not realistic, considering the election didn't take place in a vacuum. The declines are interrelated. POST GRADUATES Post-graduates went by a slightly wider margin for Clinton than Obama: 2012: 18% of electorate, 55-42 Obama 2016: 18% of electorate, 58-37 Clinton This furthers the distinct education gap in this election, especially among whites. 5. Whites without college degrees have fled to the GOP. They were a group Democrats used to compete with. In 1992 and 1996, Bill Clinton won them by a point. But they have fled to the GOP in the years since \u2013- and now the gap between whites with college degrees and without appears to be the widest ever. A whopping 35 points. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben charted it here . WHITES WITHOUT A DEGREE ",

What they learned soon after, however, was that they would just be getting started on the trail of a suspected serial killer. \u201c 48 Hours \u201d goes inside the missing persons investigation and the stunning revelations her alleged captor, Todd Kohlhepp , 45, a real estate broker, made to police in \u201cBuried Truth\u201d to be broadcast Saturday, Nov. 12 at 10 p.m. ET/PT\u00a0 on CBS. Mother of alleged S.C. serial killer: \u201cTodd was not a monster\u201d It\u2019s a story that has made international headlines and continues to unfold as investigators search and find more victims of an alleged serial killer in South Carolina. Correspondents David Begnaud and Peter Van Sant interview investigators, family members, neighbors and friends of the victims. And they talk with experts and others about the mind of a serial killer. Close Anderson, S.C. Police Dept. An investigation led sheriff\u2019s deputies to Kohlhepp\u2019s property last Thursday looking for Kala Brown and her boyfriend, Charles David Carver. Brown had worked for Kohlhepp cleaning houses for his real estate business. Police say Brown, 30, was chained to the shipping container .\u00a0 Later, Kohlhepp shot Carver dead in front of Brown. Brown told the police she had been a hostage for two months on Kohlhepp\u2019s 95-acre farm just outside Spartanburg. Todd Kohlhepp Close Police immediately arrested Kohlhepp.\u00a0 While in custody, Kohlhepp asked for three things before starting to talk. And when Kohlhepp finally opened up he told police more than they ever expected. He revealed critical clues in the well-known cold case of four gruesome murders at a Chesnee, S.C. motorcycle shop in 2003. He also admitted to killing a young couple last December, later identified as Johnny Coxie and Meagan McCraw. \u00a0 Kohlhepp later led police to a location on his property where he had buried Carver, Coxie and McCraw. \u201c48 Hours\u201d explores in depth the lives horribly changed when their loved ones disappeared or were murdered, and who had to exist for years without knowing what happened. The team also examines the life of the self-confessed killer, who after a troubled childhood committed his first violent act when he was 15 years old. Police in Arizona say he sexually assaulted at gunpoint a 14-year-old girl. He was sentenced as an adult and served a 15-year sentence. On the outside, Kohlhepp displayed signs of success, including expensive cars and flying small planes. His life behind closed doors, however, appears to be quite different. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

The concert marked a rebirth for the Bataclan concert hall, which was devastated on Nov. 13 of last year when terrorists killed 130 people and injured hundreds more in a series of coordinated attacks across the French capital. Sting, in a T-shirt with a guitar slung over his shoulder, asked concertgoers in French to observe a minute of silence as he opened the show. \"We will not forget them,\" the singer said of the victims. \"Tonight, we have two tasks to settle. First, to remember and honor those who lost their life in the attacks. Then, to celebrate life and music.\" \u2014 J-Francois Belanger (@belangerjf) November 12, 2016 He began the concert with his emotional hit, \"Fragile\", belting out: \"Nothing comes from violence and nothing will.\" French-Lebanese trumpet star Ibrahim Maalouf soon appeared on stage to join Sting to perform \"Message in A Bottle\" as they moved the audience to its feet with clapping. \"I'll send an SOS to the world,\" he sang. \"Only hope can keep us alive.\" Sting planned to perform new songs from his latest album, \"57th & 9th,\" according to the set list posted on social media. A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) Hundreds of yards of barricades, extensive body searches and scores of armed police greeted the 1,000 ticket holders who secured seats. Survivors were also invited to attend. \"I'm happy to be here but also scared,\" Didier Delalande said as he attended the concert in memory of his friend's sister who was killed. Georges Salines, head of the Bataclan victim's group \"13th November Fraternity and Truth\" came to support the reopening in the memory of his daughter, Lola, who died during the attacks. \"It's important this venue reopens to show that we are standing up to the terrorists who tried to destabilize our lives.\" ISIS claimed the violence that targeted bars, restaurants and a city sports stadium last November. Some survivors on Saturday stayed outside the Bataclan in quiet vigil, while others shared drinks in honor of the lost lives. The smell of fresh paint from the reconstruction hung over the crowd. Le public trinque \u00e0 la vie au #Bataclan pic.twitter.com/uX6r1tuMet \u2014 joelle meskens (@jmeskens) November 12, 2016 One family pasted inspirational messages on the trees surrounding the concert hall to commemorate the life of their brother and son, and other victims. \"To everyone who came to this concert...and to my brother, Christophe who has shown immense courage since the age of 1 years old. We love you,\" the post read. Une famille est venue accrocher ces messages en face du #Bataclan . Bouleversant. #Sting pic.twitter.com/LoRf6faRvT \u2014 Arnaud Tousch (@nanotousch) November 12, 2016 French officials at the Bataclan included Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Audrey Azoulay, the minister of culture. \"Our return to Bataclan is a victory of youth and humanist ideas against terror and division,\" Azoulay posted on Facebook. Sting is no stranger to the Bataclan, playing there decades ago in 1979 as the lead singer of The Police. He said proceeds from the concert would go to two charities helping survivors. The concert hall \u2014 which has been refurbished to its original state \u2014 will remain closed on Sunday's actual anniversary of the attacks, when French President Francois Hollande and Hidalgo will unveil plaques in memory of victims at the half-dozen sites where revelers died.

But you can already tell he'll be mightily tempted to let loose with those trademark tweets. He tells \" 60 Minutes \" he's going to be \"very restrained, if I use it at all.\" But he went on to call Twitter \"tremendous\" and said social media is \"where it's at.\" As he put it: \"I have a method of fighting back.\" The president-elect says social media helped him win races in states where he was vastly outspent, and he thinks he's proved that the medium can be more powerful than money. Some of Trump's most provocative comments in the primary and general election campaigns came from his tweets, often late at night. The \"60 Minutes\" interview will be broadcast Sunday. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story At the state level, the outcome means 24 states will be under full Republican control in legislatures and governor\u2019s offices, clearing the way for new policy. Only six states will now have legislatures and governor\u2019s offices exclusively dominated by Democrats, Mr. Storey said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Matt Walter, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee , said the Republican sweep has been mounting for years, particularly in state legislatures, where Republicans have grown increasingly dominant since 2010. During President Obama\u2019s time in office, Democratic state lawmakers lost more than 800 legislative seats. \u201cThe personalities this time were so big and the drama was so big and so rapidly changing and consumed so many people\u2019s attention that it in some respects blinded them to this trend line that this has been bubbling up for many years,\u201d Mr. Walter said. \u201cIt really is the manifestation of this change that we\u2019ve been seeing bubbling up from the bottom for many cycles now.\u201d In theory, one-party control in a divided nation might spur lawmakers to find bipartisan answers to bipartisan problems. But few people expect that. In Wisconsin, where Republicans took hold of state government years ago though the populace remained somewhat split politically, the political leaders have done the opposite \u2014 pressing forward with a conservative agenda that has included hard-fought measures to reduce labor power, limit abortions and add restrictions on voting that disproportionately affect Democratic constituencies. Photo Nicole Ashton, left, co-owner of a gift shop in Somers, who is Karen Ashton\u2019s daughter. Credit Lauren Justice for The New York Times On Tuesday, Wisconsinites chose a Republican for president, something they had not done since 1984, propelled by worries over the economy and a desire to shake up Washington. Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by about 1 percentage point, or about 27,000 votes. Some voters here said that they were encouraged by a flip to Republican control of Wisconsin\u2019s Legislature and governor\u2019s office six years ago, and favored Mr. Trump in the hopes that he would deliver more of the same to the nation. \u201cSince 2011, we have made decisions one after another \u2014 some controversial, many, many bipartisan \u2014 to move Wisconsin forward,\u201d Robin Vos , the speaker of the State Assembly, said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the model that we want to use as we go to look at what Washington, D.C., should do. Stick to your principles. Remember the people who actually sent you to get things done.\u201d Wisconsin\u2019s state-level switch to Republican control was not without a battle. In 2011, thousands of demonstrators furiously protested efforts to limit labor union power, including sharply cutting collective bargaining rights for most public-sector workers. Gov. Scott Walker soon faced a recall election, which he won . Labor unions shrank significantly in the state, and the Republicans pressed on with other parts of their agenda, including voter ID requirements and redrawing political maps. On Tuesday night, the Wisconsin Legislature remained firmly in the hands of Republicans, including what leaders described as their largest majority in the Assembly since 1956. \u201cThe Republicans didn\u2019t work with the Democrats at all,\u201d said Chris Larson, a state senator, who was among a group of Democratic lawmakers who fled to Illinois for weeks in 2011 in an unsuccessful attempt to block passage of the collective-bargaining cuts. \u201cThey came in and just did everything as fast as they could. They jammed through everything. And pretty quickly, they had everything they wanted.\u201d In more than a dozen interviews in Somers, a bedroom community on Lake Michigan dominated by farms, small businesses and a public university, many residents said they were pleasantly surprised to wake up to the news Wednesday morning that their state had flipped from blue to red. Photo The Wisconsin State Assembly in 2011 during a debate over curbing the bargaining rights of public-sector unions. Credit Darren Hauck/Reuters They said the deepening conservatism had been years in the making. They had grown discontented with Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act, and were turned off by Mrs. Clinton, whom they saw as untrustworthy. At Tina\u2019s Somers Inn on the village\u2019s main commercial strip, one group of retirees sat at a table playing their regular game of euchre while Fox News was on a nearby television. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe\u2019re still a mix of Democrats and Republicans here \u2014 I don\u2019t think you could call us a red state,\u201d said Dianne Hegewald, 71. \u201cI have very close friends who are Democrats. But the Republican regime is just doing a better job right now.\u201d Karen Ashton, the owner of a gift shop in Somers, said she was a registered independent but was eager for Republicans to have full control of all branches of government. \u201cNow they\u2019ll really be able to get things done,\u201d she said. Some of her friends and neighbors in town are farmers who have been hurt by Environmental Protection Agency regulations and high taxes, she said, sipping a kombucha tea. \u201cThey\u2019re sick of the government,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think that with Trump in there, he can fix all of that.\u201d One-party rule can produce results, experts say, and it can also produce changes that will benefit the party in power. Control tends to breed more: Legislators have the ability to redraw political maps in the coming years and establish voting rules that benefit their party. Cooperation between state and federal leaders of a single party can speed along results, from infrastructure projects to federal grants. Photo \u201cThe Republican regime is just doing a better job right now,\u201d said Dianne Hegewald, 71. Credit Lauren Justice for The New York Times But there are risks, too. Charging too far too fast can cause blowback as quickly as in elections just two years from now. \u201cThere\u2019s always a danger of overreach,\u201d said KC Johnson, a professor of history at Brooklyn College. He noted the Republican dominance in the 1920s, when, he said, a debate over cultural issues tended to overshadow mounting economic questions that eventually culminated in the Great Depression. \u201cThe contrast between attention paid to issues that ultimately proved unimportant and attention not paid to issues that became important later on is interesting. We know how the 1920s end,\u201d he said. It is hard to measure control of so many offices with numeric precision, but he said that Democrats had probably last held a level of power similar to what the Republicans have now between 1937 and 1945. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe evidence is mixed on unified government,\u201d said William Howell , a political scientist at the University of Chicago. \u201cThere is a fair bit of historical evidence that Congress enacts more laws during periods of unified government. But in this period of slim majorities and rampant obstructionism, past trends may not hold.\u201d Fred Risser, a Democratic Wisconsin state senator who is the longest-serving state lawmaker in the nation, said the stakes of the Republicans\u2019 dominance for the nation\u2019s policy \u2014 for taxes, education policy, environmental regulation \u2014 were enormous. Yet Mr. Risser, 89, who first held political office in 1956, said the risks for the Republicans were also large. \u201cThey\u2019ve got everything now, and so everything that happens they are responsible for and no one can blame the Democrats anymore. It\u2019s always difficult to control everything. They have a lot to lose.\u201d Linda Truesdell, whose family has lived in the Somers area since the 1820s, said on Wednesday that she was disheartened by the Republican takeover. She had twice voted for Mr. Obama, who in 2012 beat Mitt Romney by 12 points in this county; on Tuesday, Mr. Trump beat Mrs. Clinton here by less than one percentage point \u2014 225 votes. \u201cTrump was a television personality and that had a big influence on people,\u201d she said, as she left the town post office and walked toward her pickup truck. \u201cPeople here are thinking that he\u2019s going to solve their problems.\u201d Correction: November 12, 2016 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a photo caption accompanying this article misidentified one of the women shown.

(Photo: Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports) The famously-pink visiting locker room at the Iowa Hawkeyes' Kinnick Stadium got a makeover on Saturday afternoon. A Michigan makeover. Before the two teams faced off at 8 p.m. ET, the No. 3-ranked Wolverines got rid of any psychological advantage the Hawkeyes may have hoped for, making themselves right at home by covering most of the locker room with Michigan Maize and Blue. \u2014 Michigan Equipment (@HailEquipment) November 12, 2016 Week 11 gallery Posted!

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Aaron Blake November 11 at 2:15 PM Follow @aaronblake Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke holds up a rifle that was presented to him as part of his Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award at the Conservative Political Action Conference\u00a0in February 2015 in National Harbor, Md. (Alex Brandon/AP) We don't know a whole heckuva lot about who Donald Trump will pick for his Cabinet at this point. So far, the process is heavy on rumors and preliminary lists. For Trump, selecting and vetting his picks isn't a three-day process, nor should we expect much of it to be done in public. It's also important to emphasize upfront that names floated for various positions are\u00a0sometimes more about expressing gratitude to surrogates, even if they're unlikely to actually get picked. That said, some of the early names leaking out are of the sort that could send a real signal about Trump's path going forward.\u00a0And some of those paths could really make Democrats squirm. Here's a rundown of the more controversial names that have been floated. Joe Arpaio: Potential homeland security secretary? ABC News on Wednesday included Arpaio's name as a possible Trump homeland security secretary , and though it's not clear how seriously he's being considered, it would seem to be a good fit for Trump's immigration platform. The controversial sheriff of Arizona's Maricopa County, Joe Arpaio, announced his endorsement of Republican presidential contender Donald Trump saying that it was a \"no brainer.\" (Reuters) Arpaio is the outgoing sheriff of Maricopa County (he just lost his bid for a seventh term) and is known for his hard-line stances on illegal immigration, his harsh rhetoric and making inmates wear pink underwear. Arpaio has faced accusations of instituting racial profiling for years , and in May a federal judge ruled that he had ignored federal orders to halt the tactics in question. The Post's Jerry Markon reports, though, that Arpaio's selection appears unlikely : But other people familiar with the deliberations said Arpaio is viewed as unable to win Senate confirmation. He is also 84 years old and facing legal trouble. The longtime sheriff was recently charged with criminal contempt for resisting a judge\u2019s order that he stop detaining people solely on suspicion they were undocumented immigrants. Arpaio, whose wife is battling cancer, could face up to six months in jail if convicted. David Clarke: Homeland security? This is another pick that is perhaps unlikely. Markon's story doesn't mention the Milwaukee County sheriff, who was a vocal Trump supporter. But others have, Politico said a Trump campaign source named Clarke as a possible pick , and a preliminary list of 41 names obtained by BuzzFeed's John Stanton also includes Clarke. Even Clarke has weighed in, downplaying it but not totally dismissing the idea . Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke offered his support for police officers around the country during a speech on the opening day of the Republican National Convention July 18. (The Washington Post) Clarke's rhetoric on law enforcement echoes Arpaio in many ways. A regular surrogate for Trump's campaign, Clarke, who is black, has compared Black Lives Matter to the Islamic State, a.k.a. ISIS. Before long, Black Lies Matter will join forces with ISIS to being down our legal constituted republic. You heard it first here. \u2014 David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) October 28, 2015 And on Wednesday night, he called for protests against President-elect Trump to be \u201cquelled.\u201d These temper tantrums from these radical anarchists must be quelled. There is no legitimate reason to protest the will of the people. pic.twitter.com/G502pwNSN9 \u2014 David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) November 10, 2016 Sen. Jeff Sessions: Attorney general, Defense Department, OMB? Sessions's name is also on BuzzFeed's list for three possible slots, and his potential leadership of the Defense Department was explored by The Post's Dan Lamothe . He isn't as much a household name as some others on this list. But from a policy standpoint, he may be the Senate's foremost immigration hard-liner, and his\u00a0long-ago political past could come up if he's nominated. Before resurrecting his political career as Alabama attorney general and then being elected senator in 1996, Sessions was denied a judgeship over allegations of racism. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's White House bid during a joint appearance in his home state. (Reuters) As Lamothe reports : In 1986, he was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to serve as a federal-district court judge, but a bipartisan panel of Judiciary Committee senators declined to send his nomination to the Senate floor amid allegations that he had said the NAACP was \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cCommunist-inspired\u201d and that a white civil rights lawyer was a \u201cdisgrace to his race.\u201d Sessions vigorously denied the allegations. Ben Carson: Health and Human Services or Education? Back in May, Trump agreed with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that Carson would make a good pick for HHS, and he has also floated Carson for the Education Department. Carson said himself back in March that Trump offered him a role in a Trump administration , at least in an advisory capacity. And indeed, his name\u00a0 appears on the BuzzFeed list as a possible education or HHS secretary . Carson rose to prominence in the 2016 GOP primary as a vocal critic of Obamacare, which he has\u00a0said was the worst thing since slavery \u00a0and also suggested it was a form of slavery. He has also said liberals would turn the United States into Nazi Germany. \u201cAnd if you believe that same thing can\u2019t happen again, you\u2019re very wrong,\u201d Carson said in 2014 . \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to let it happen.\u201d And Carson said during the 2016 campaign that he wouldn't be okay with a Muslim as president , suggesting that a Muslim's values would be inconsistent with American values. Sid Miller: Agriculture secretary? Texas Agricultural Commissioner Sid Miller in Austin\u00a0in 2015. (Eric Gay/AP) Miller's name is on the BuzzFeed list for agriculture secretary. And while, like Sessions, he\u00a0might not be well known outside of political circles, he's known to say controversial things on social media. The Texas agriculture commissioner's Twitter account\u00a0 recently called Hillary Clinton a \u201cc---\" in a tweet . A spokesman suggested the account had been hacked, and the tweet has been deleted. Miller has also shared on Facebook a doctored photo of President Obama holding up a Che Guevara T-shirt , and in 2015 his social-media team shared an image suggesting a nuclear attack on the Muslim world . Rudy Giuliani: Attorney general? This would seem to be among the more likely potential Cabinet picks on this list. Giuliani has been among the most vocal and outspoken Trump surrogates for months. In that role, though, he has often gone even further than Trump. Giuliani has said directly that he thought Hillary Clinton looked ill on the campaign trail, pressed the idea that voter fraud could rob Trump of the election , and was among the earliest public advocates for attacking Bill Clinton's indiscretions in the White House . And here's more \u00a0from: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) is a big fan of Donald Trump \u2013 and he's said some strange things while campaigning for the Republican nominee. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Giuliani, once the beloved, moderate Republican mayor of New York City on 9/11, over the course of this campaign turned himself into a bare-knuckle political brawler, willing to say pretty much anything to help Trump get elected. Ken Blackwell: Leader of domestic transition team This one is in the books \u2014 a done deal . And for liberals, it's an inauspicious start. Blackwell is a former Ohio secretary of state and GOP nominee for governor, and he is popular among conservatives.\u00a0He's also\u00a0someone Democrats love to hate for his comments about the LGBT community and his decisions during the hotly contested 2004 presidential election in Ohio. Back then, then-Secretary of State Blackwell ruled that provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct should not be counted. Democrats appealed and lost. The following year, the DNC drafted a report alleging voter suppression in the state. And while running for chairman of the RNC in 2009, Blackwell said that being gay is a choice and compared it to having the proclivity to commit arson or be a kleptomaniac . Sarah Palin: Interior Department? Palin's name was included on BuzzFeed's list, for the possible job of interior secretary. Again, it's not clear how serious her consideration may be, but it's one that would certainly make liberals' heads spin. That said, Palin hasn't been a hugely visible supporter of Trump on the campaign trail. politics ",

The gunshots came on the fourth night of protests in Portland. A day earlier, a similar rally boiled over into what police described as a \"riot\" after some demonstrators armed with bats smashed stores and cars, and others lit fires. Can You IDME? Riot Vandalism & Assault Suspect https://t.co/QJ4kiAHyzd #CanYouIDME pic.twitter.com/zBQBkuxzxW \u2014 Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) November 12, 2016 Elsewhere overnight Friday , marchers blocked a major roadway in the Miami area and hundreds gathered in Atlanta, Boston and other cities. By early Saturday in New York, a total of 11 arrests were reported. A larger protest that was organized Saturday afternoon began in Manhattan's Union Square and ended at Trump Tower in midtown, where demonstrators stopped and chanted in front of the skyscraper where Trump resides and was meeting with visitors. MSNBC reported more than 16,000 protesters were expected outside of Trump Tower. \"We reject the president-elect!\" the crowd chanted along Fifth Avenue. \u2014 Morgan Radford (@MorganRadford) November 12, 2016 Among the sea of police officers, protesters and gawkers at Trump Tower were some familiar faces. Filmmaker Michael Moore showed up at the president-elect's iconic Fifth Avenue landmark, live-streaming his visit as he made his way as far into the building as he could before security stopped him. Trump is is an \"illegitimate president and does not have the vote of the people,\" Moore told NBC News as he ascended up the floors of the ornate building that bears Trump's name in gold on the front of it. Moore, who was wearing a safety pin as a show of solidarity for minorities and women who feel threatened after Trump's election, was stopped on the fourth floor when he asked to meet with Trump. \"You'd have a to check with his staff,\" a secret service agent told him. A protester on Fifth Avenue in New York City on Nov. 12, 2016. Yasmin Merchant Moore settled on leaving a handwritten note for Trump that said: \"Mr. Trump I'm here. I want to talk to you\" before he got into a debate with a Trump supporter in a \"Make America Great Again\" hat and then left the building. Other big names seen at the building Saturday included chairman of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus and interim leader of the U.K. Independence Party Nigel Farage. The visitors come as Trump is picking his transition team, which Trump put Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of on Friday . When asked if he was there for transition talks, Farage told NBC News: \"We're just tourists.\" But the protests outside also drew some in favor of Trump, and they held signs that read, \"He is My President,\" \"Hillary for Prison\" and \"Crybabies.\" \"We are the popular vote\" chant protesters. @msnbc pic.twitter.com/AmDyCTIfCz \u2014 Morgan Radford (@MorganRadford) November 12, 2016 Another protest took place Saturday morning in downtown Los Angeles, where approximately 8,000 gathered \u2014 according to the LAPD \u2014 after more than 180 people were arrested Friday night. Protesters hold up signs during a march and rally against the election of Donald Trump in Los Angeles on Nov. 12.

(Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports) A little over a year after undergoing season-ending neck surgery, Baylor quarterback Seth Russell is\u00a0most\u00a0likely\u00a0done\u00a0for the rest of his senior\u00a0season, too. Late in the third quarter of the Bears' game against the Oklahoma Sooners on Saturday, Russell scrambled out of the pocket and \u2014\u00a0after gaining about 10 yards \u2014 was taken down\u00a0by Sooners linebacker Caleb Kelly. Unable to get up after the play, Russell immediately began pointing to his left leg, which bent awkwardly during\u00a0contact. The Bears announced that Russell\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who was eventually carted off the field\u00a0\u2014\u00a0suffered a dislocated ankle. Freshman quarterback Zach Smith entered the game as his replacement. \"The good news is that I think he'll heal up just fine, but the bad news is that I don't think he'll get back this year,\" acting Baylor coach Jim Grobe said. \"Just really, really sad because you love the kid so much.\" Beware: the replay is the furthest thing from pretty.

    "text": "Nov 11 2016, 9:14 pm ET What Will a Trump Administration Do About Marijuana Legalization? by Phil McCausland advertisement It's unclear whether a Donald Trump administration will kill pot advocates' vibe after their landslide victory on Tuesday. Nine different states voted on marijuana-related ballot initiatives \u2014 four considered legal medical marijuana and five chose whether to legalize recreational marijuana. Eight of those initiatives passed , including recreational approval in California, Massachusetts, Nevada and Maine. Arizona's failed. Play OCT. 7: 9 states voting to legalize some form of marijuana 1:50 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161113023835if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/802939971649\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump has made seemingly supportive statements for marijuana legalization in the past, but the potential inclusion of politicians who are traditionally conservative on drug policy in his future administration \u2014 such as Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie and Mike Pence \u2014 has harshed some legalization supporters' mellow. \"I'm mostly concerned by the people around Donald Trump,\" said Executive Director of the Drug Policy Alliance Ethan Nadelmann \u2014 the man considered the major powerhouse behind marijuana legalization in the country. The opposition also believe Trump's potential appointees could point toward future policy. \"When we see Guiliani and Christie and Sessions around him, I think things could change pretty quickly,\" said Dr. Kevin Sabet, co-founder of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana. \"Everything is up in the air right now.\" \"When we see Guiliani and Christie and Sessions around him, I think things could change pretty quickly,\" said Dr. Kevin Sabet, co-founder of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana. \"Everything is up in the air right now.\" There are two federal mandates that a Trump administration could affect: the Hinchey-Rohrabacher medical marijuana amendment and the Department of Justice's Cole Memo. The Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment is a piece of congressional legislation that prohibits the Department of Justice from spending federal dollars to enforce federal prohibition in states that have moved to decriminalize or legalize medical marijuana. The Cole Memo was written under former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and states that the federal government will not interfere with states that legalize recreational and medical marijuana so long as they follow a series of guidelines set forth within the document. Related: With Trump in White House, Criminal Justice Reformers Will Look Elsewhere \"Every state [that has legalized recreational or medical marijuana] has used those guidelines as the North Star on how to write your new state law,\" said Lynne Lyman, the state director of California's Drug Policy Alliance. \"So we have no idea ... whether a Trump administration will send in the DEA or FBI to shut down California's marijuana industry.\" Like many issues, Trump has been all over the map on the marijuana question. In April 1990, addressing the War on Drugs, Trump told the Miami Herald that the United States needed to legalize all drugs and use the tax revenue to educate Americans about the dangers of drugs. More recently, the president-elect said it isn't the federal government's business. \"In terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state,\" Trump said during a Nevada rally in Oct. 2015. \"In terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state,\" Trump said during a Nevada rally in Oct. 2015. \"I really think that we should study Colorado, see what's happening,\" he added later in the rally. Colorado voters approved recreational marijuana in 2012. In February, Trump told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that he was \"in favor of medical marijuana 100 percent\" and had seen people benefit from its use, but he backtracked when asked whether he supported Colorado's recreational marijuana industry. \"Perhaps not. [Legal pot is] causing a lot of problems out there,\" Trump said. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to a request seeking comment. US President-elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania walk with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) following a meeting at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on November 10, 2016. NICHOLAS KAMM / AFP - Getty Images Nevertheless, legalization supporters feel buoyed by Trump's tendency toward populism, as the initiatives certainly won the popular vote in eight of nine states. \"Our landslide success really affirms that public opinion to legalize marijuana is not the minority opinion, and it is clear that it is here to stay,\" said Danielle Keane, the political director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).

Sales of legal marijuana currently sit at $3.5 to $4.3 billion, but it could reach as high as $8 billion with the addition of the states that approved ballot initiatives Tuesday, according to Marijuana Business Daily. In California the success of Proposition 64 was seen as a huge victory in the fight to make weed legal because of the large size of the state and its economy, and pro-legalization groups poured a huge amount of money and energy into the state. The Gallup Poll predicted a win in California could lead other states to follow suit. Organizations like NORML knocked on doors and hosted events to get voters out, while the Drug Policy Alliance mobilized African-Americans, Latinos and young people through phone banking, social media drives and by involving high-profile celebrities \u2014 like Danny Glover, Common, Rosario Dawson and others \u2014 in their \"Artists for 64\" campaign. \u2014 Temporary Earthling (@IGobeFree) November 8, 2016 Legalization supporters chose carefully where to place funds and support, only considering states with enthusiastic public opinion polls, Nadelmann told NBC News. \"You don't do ballot initiatives, at least with the limited resources we have, in order to persuade people to vote for something,\" Nadelmann said. He said his organization poured 75 percent of a $6 million national effort into California. \"You start off with the majority in your favor and try to hang on as the election approaches and ward off scare tactics,\" Nadelmann said. People gather for an election results watch party put on by supporters of Arizona Proposition 205, a legal marijuana initiative, in Phoenix, Arizona, on Nov. 8, 2016. NANCY WIECHEC / Reuters Arizona is the single state of nine that didn't pass its proposed ballot initiative. A group opposed to the measure, Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, waged an 18-month campaign that warned of changes to employment drug testing, edible marijuana's potential attractiveness to children and the increase of marijuana potency. \"We knew if it passed here, there probably wouldn't be any states that could stop it,\" said Seth Liebsohn, co-founder of the group. \"As the old saying goes, we were 'thinking nationally but acting locally.'\" But the question remains whether a President Trump will be convinced by similar arguments. Legalization supporters remain confident. \"Marijuana legalization is now supported by a growing number of Republicans, a majority of Republican millennials and by a number of people in the marijuana industry,\" Nadelmann told NBC News. \"It's also progressed pretty far,\" he added. \"Shutting it down would not be an easy thing to do.\" Phil McCausland ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story \u201cA new president is really vulnerable and open to all sorts of influence by strong-willed advisers,\u201d said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. \u201cTrump\u2019s appointments over the next six weeks will be very significant because they can show whether he wants to create some unity in the country, or whether he really intends to deliver on his ideas.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story One of the influences on Mr. Trump could come from an unlikely quarter: President Obama. Meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he looked forward \u201cto dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.\u201d A day later, in interviews with The Wall Street Journal and \u201c 60 Minutes ,\u2019\u2019 he said he had decided to retain elements of Mr. Obama\u2019s landmark health care law after their conversation \u2014 a hint, at least, that he might govern less radically than he had campaigned. White House officials expressed hope that Mr. Obama would be able to impress on Mr. Trump the importance of other parts of his legacy, like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal . The two will have the kind of peer-to-peer relationship that only fellow presidents can have \u2014 something that administration officials hope will appeal to Mr. Trump\u2019s pride, as well as his desire to succeed, and make him view Mr. Obama less as a rival. They conceded, though, that there was little historical precedent for such a relationship, especially when the incoming president had ousted the incumbent\u2019s party after such an acrid campaign, and that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama were never likely to become buddies. Mr. Trump is drawing mainly from a pool of trusted aides and supporters, according to people familiar with the campaign. On Friday, he named three of his grown children \u2014 Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric \u2014 as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to his transition team, an arrangement that rang alarm bells in Washington because they will also manage his businesses. The Trump family, it is clear, will wield unusual power in the composition of an administration that is already shaping up as remarkable for its clannishness. Even within Mr. Trump\u2019s tight circle, however, there are sharp differences in ideology, background and temperament that could play out in how the White House deals with Congress and how the United States deals with the rest of the world. Perhaps the deepest schism is between Stephen K. Bannon, the conservative provocateur and media entrepreneur who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, and Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chairman who came to terms with Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Both are on a short list for chief of staff, according to people close to the campaign, and whoever is chosen, the other is likely to get another senior White House post. Each would bring a radically different approach to a job often called the second-most powerful in Washington \u2014 gatekeeper to the president and often the first and last person he sees in the Oval Office. Mr. Bannon, the executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart News and one-time Goldman Sachs executive, is an avowed enemy of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. An anti-establishment verbal bomb thrower with ties to the alt-right movement, Mr. Bannon may have little interest in compromising with the Republican-controlled Congress under its current leadership. He is an unabashed critic of the current immigration system and repeatedly encouraged Mr. Trump to appeal to the party\u2019s base in the closing days of the campaign with arguments against globalization. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Priebus, a party loyalist who tried to reconcile Republican leaders with their renegade nominee, would most likely build bridges to Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders. A Washington insider with a reputation for being easy to work with, Mr. Priebus would operate a more traditional White House, though given Mr. Trump\u2019s flamboyant personality, traditional is a relative term. Photo Meeting with President Obama in the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he looked forward \u201cto dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.\u201d Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times In some ways, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Priebus are proxies for the larger battle over what kind of president Mr. Trump will be. Some former Republican officials held out hope that Mr. Trump would be receptive to moderating influences, but others worried that he would simply listen to the last person he spoke to. \u201cYou always have that tension between what he said to get elected and what he actually believes,\u201d said John D. Negroponte, a former director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush. \u201cHow selective will his amnesia be?\u201d Mr. Negroponte, a Republican who supported Hillary Clinton in the campaign, said he could imagine senior members of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Security Council warning him about the dangers of \u201ccutting loose countries from our nuclear umbrella,\u201d which Mr. Trump threatened during the campaign to do in reference to Japan and South Korea.

    "text": "Privacy Policy It is uncharted territory for a modern American presidency. One would have to go back to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s election in 1860 to see these types of mass demonstrations in response to the election of a president, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who teaches at Rice University in Houston. President Lincoln won only about 40 percent of the popular vote and was not even on the ballot in some Southern states. Spontaneous protests broke out across the country after the Lincoln victory, Mr. Brinkley said. For many of the people who have turned out for the current protests, it has been a kind of group therapy, and already seem to be cementing new, cross-sectional liberal coalitions. People with \u201cNasty Women\u201d T-shirts have stood with signs that read \u201cClimate change is real.\u201d Black Lives Matter protesters have marched alongside those proclaiming themselves \u201cUndocumented and Unafraid.\u201d But beyond the commotion in the streets, activists are pursuing strategies for what they think will be tumultuous times during a Trump administration. Photo A protester received medical aid early Saturday in Portland, Ore., where the police had used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse anti-Trump demonstrators. Credit Cole Howard/Reuters In Wisconsin, the Latino rights group Voces de la Frontera has scheduled forums to provide emotional support to Latinos and other minorities, and to brainstorm ways to help immigrants fight policies that might hurt them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cat Brooks, a co-founder of the Anti Police-Terror Project in Oakland, said her group and other leaders in the city were planning to raise money to provide direct services for social programs they feel certain will be cut under a Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress. They were making plans, for example, to find ways to offer diabetes testing and counseling if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. Ron Gochez, an organizer with Uni\u00f3n del Barrio, an immigrants rights group in Los Angeles, said that it will gather community organizations to discuss what to do if mass deportations occur. It will also train undocumented immigrants to use their cellphone cameras if immigration enforcement agents show up at their door, and help people set up emergency phone lists so they can call neighbors if they are picked up for deportation proceedings. \u201cIt\u2019s not just saying that we\u2019re against Trump, we have to defend ourselves against the policies he\u2019s promising to create,\u201d he said. Leaders from several black civil rights groups like the National Action Network and the N.A.A.C.P. have been holding conference calls to form a legislative strategy, the Rev. Al Sharpton said. They plan to lobby Congress on criminal justice reform and expanding voting rights, highlighting what they believe are the negative effects of voter identification laws and reductions in early voting periods, Mr. Sharpton said. They hope to use the stories of millions of newly insured Americans to highlight the devastating consequences of repealing the Affordable Care Act. They will fight any new stop-and-frisk policies in court, Mr. Sharpton said, and bring witnesses to congressional hearings to challenge cabinet appointments they see as questionable. Their efforts will kick off with a rally and a march in Washington for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday, just days before Mr. Trump is inaugurated, Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go away and say, because we lost an election, that we, therefore, lost our right to stand up for civil rights and civil liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cThis, in many ways, we feel is bigger than one election.\u201d As the protest began to wane in Los Angeles, Jay Brown Jr., 42, surveyed the large group around him. \u201cIf you look around, there are a lot of families out here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should say something to you. People are trying to teach their kids what\u2019s acceptable.\u201d Eli Rosenberg reported from New York; Jennifer Medina from Oakland, Calif.; and John Eligon from Kansas City, Mo.

    "text": "By Margaret Brennan CBS News November 12, 2016, 10:41 AM Arab allies say messages from Trump's transition team have been \"very positive\" Email At the very highest level, the messages from Donald Trump\u2019s transition team have been very positive and reassuring to Arab allies, according to one Arab diplomat who was on a recent call with the transition team. These allies are confident that they can work through any concerns related to the heated rhetoric of the campaign. Thousands of people took to the streets for a third straight night to protest a Donald Trump presidency. In Portland, Oregon overnight, police sa... The potential national security picks look promising to them, with\u00a0 several potential Cabinet-level members \u00a0who are very familiar with avenues of U.S.-Arab cooperation on areas such as counterterrorism and intelligence.\u00a0 That\u2019s perhaps unsurprising given the distrust that grew between the Obama Administration and Gulf allies following the Iran deal and failure to enforce the \u201cred line\u201d in Syria. However, Arab allies also say they are not sure what to expect from the Trump administration and want to see whether he signs off on the proposed appointments. The Trump team has not yet contacted all U.S. allies in the Gulf, many of whom are nervous about Iranian encroachment and have become key to the US campaign against ISIS. CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett has reported that Trump is considering former Speaker Newt Gingrich or George W. Bush-era U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton for secretary of state. Retired Army General Michael Flynn or Bolton could be national security adviser, and Rep. Michael McCaul, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie or former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani are being considered for Homeland Security Secretary. Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee is also in the running as a potential secretary of state.\u00a0 During the presidential campaign, Trump called for a Muslim entry ban, a proposal that\u00a0 recently disappeared from his campaign website \u00a0before it was restored. In July,\u00a0 Trump announced he was expanding the ban \u00a0to include suspending immigration from \u201cany nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
