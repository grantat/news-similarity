It was a slow news day, Mr. Clayton said. Scheduled to shoot swimmer Matthew Dunn at an award ceremony, he asked to accompany him to an earlier training session at a nearby college.\n\nBefore taking the photo, Mr. Clayton noticed that when swimmers come up for breath, the water is completely still.\n\nHe positioned himself 10 meters away from Mr. Dunn at the end of the pool, and held the camera to be at the same level as the swimmer’s head. “You look at technology now, you see a lot of those photographs,” said Mr. Clayton, who shot in black-and-white, without autofocus. “At the time, I happened to nail the moment.”","credit":"Tim Clayton","widths":{"1260":{"w":1268,"h":813,"url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20160714010226/https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-OW330_TIMCLA_8RH_20160712110035.jpg"}}},{"slug":"UNNAMED1_ORjpg","caption":"Jan Grarup, ‘Death or Play.
